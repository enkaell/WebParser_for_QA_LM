  "text": "A spacecraft can estimate the attitude state by comparing external measurements from attitude sensors with reference information. CubeSats tend to use 4-quadrant analog solar sensors which have the advantages of extremely low power consumption, minimal volume, low complexity, low cost, and high reliability as attitude sensors, considering the limitation of satellite volume and payload. The performance of the sensor can be importantly improved by the calibration procedure and compensation model.          However, the various error sources affecting the calibration of the 4-quadrant sun sensor lead to a complicated process of compensation model establishment. Deep learning, which is widely used in the aerospace field in recent years, is able to approximate any continuous function on a bounded closed set, providing new ideas for solving the traditional problem.In a research paper recently published in Space: Science & Technology, authors from Northwestern Polytechnical University, German Aerospace Center, and Dalian University of Technology together propose a method to calibrate sun sensors by deep learning, which not only is able to integrate the influence of various errors but also avoids the need of analyzing and modeling every single error.Authors first explain the calibration process of sun sensor based on cubic surface fitting. The calibration and testing platform of the sun sensor includes a solar simulation light source, high-precision 2-axis turntable, and servo controller. The outputs of the sun sensor are the incidence \u03bb and azimuth \u03c5, whose theoretical values are obtained from the angle of the turntable and actual values are measured by the sun sensor. There are large errors between the theoretical and actual values, up to 3\u00b0.By substituting the theoretical and actual values into the 3-order surface fitting formula, the cubic surface fitting model are obtained. The output value of the analog sun sensor is corrected by the cubic surface fitting model and the error is effectively reduced. However, there're larger errors close to the edge of FOV (field of view) of the sun sensor.Then, authors introduce the learning and training of the deep neural network model, which approximates the actual error model and is used for error correction. In the calibration experiment of the analog sun sensor, the deep feedforward neural network is selected to fit the error model, where ReLU (linear rectification function) is selected as the activation function, a full connection as the connection mode between 2 adjacent layers, and the mean square error (MSE) as the loss function. The neural network is trained through gradient descent algorithm and the backpropagation algorithm.Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified using experimental data. In the calibration experiment of an analog sun sensor, the training of the network model is divided into two stages: the dataset is generated by the cubic surface fitting model in the initial training stage while the deep network model adopts the measured data for learning in the final training stage.Additionally, learning data are normalized to the magnitude between 0 and 1 via the max\u2013min method. After network learning in the initial stage, the error between the output of the network model and the estimated value of the cubic surface fitting model is concentrated within 0.02\u00b0, indicating that the deep network model at this time can better map the cubic surface fitting model.In the final training stage of the feedforward neural network model, the calibration error of the incident angle can reach 0.1\u00b0 (1\u03c3) and 0.25\u00b0 (3\u03c3), which greatly improves the calibration effect of the cubic surface fitting model. These results shows that the method can effectively eliminate deterministic errors, including spot distortion and assembly errors.

  "text": "The Breakthrough Listen Investigation for Periodic Spectral Signals (BLIPSS), led by Akshay Suresh, Cornell doctoral candidate in astronomy, is pioneering a search for periodic signals emanating from the core of our galaxy, the Milky Way. The research aims to detect repetitive patterns, a way to search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) within our cosmic neighborhood.          The researchers developed software based on a Fast Folding Algorithm (FFA), an efficient search method offering enhanced sensitivity to periodic sequences of narrow pulses. Their paper, \"A 4\u20138 GHz Galactic Center Search for Periodic Technosignatures,\" was published May 30 in The Astronomical Journal.Pulsars\u2014rapidly rotating neutron stars that sweep beams of radio energy across the Earth\u2014are natural astrophysical objects that generate periodic signals but humans also use directed periodic transmissions for a variety of applications, including radar. Such signals would be a good way to get someone's attention across interstellar space, standing out from the background of non-periodic signals, as well as using much less energy than a transmitter that is broadcasting continuously.\"BLIPSS is an example of cutting-edge software as a science multiplier for SETI,\" said Suresh. \"Our study introduces to SETI, for the first time, the Fast Folding Algorithm; our open-source software utilizes an FFA to crunch over 1.5 million time series for periodic signals in roughly 30 minutes.\"                Detection of a target periodic spectral signal using blipss.

Right: radio frequency-period (P) diagram showing the detection of a P0 = 30 s signal in the central spectral channel.

The project significantly enhances the probability of capturing evidence of extraterrestrial technology by focusing on the central region of the Milky Way, known for its dense concentration of stars and potentially habitable exoplanets. The center of the Milky Way would also be an ideal place for aliens to place a beacon to contact large swaths of the Galaxy.The team tested their algorithm on known pulsars and were able to detect periodic emission as expected. They then turned to a larger dataset of scans of the Galactic Center undertaken using the Breakthrough Listen instrument on the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia. In contrast to pulsars, which emit across a wide swath of radio frequencies, BLIPSS looked for repeating signals in a narrower range of frequencies, covering less than one-tenth of the width of an average FM radio station.\"The combination of these relatively narrow bandwidths with periodic patterns could be indicative of deliberate technological activities of intelligent civilizations,\" said co-author Steve Croft, Breakthrough Listen project scientist. \"Breakthrough Listen captures huge volumes of data, and Akshay's technique provides a new method to help us search that haystack for needles that could provide tantalizing evidence of advanced extraterrestrial life forms.\"\"Until now, radio SETI has primarily dedicated its efforts to the search for continuous signals,\" said co-author Vishal Gajjar, a SETI Institute astronomer. \"Our study sheds light on the remarkable energy efficiency of a train of pulses as a means of interstellar communication across vast distances.

  "text": "An international team of astronomers, astrophysicists and cosmologists, has found evidence of galaxy M64's outer disk originating from a smaller, nearby, dwarf galaxy. The team has written a paper describing their findings that has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters\u2014in the meantime, it can be read on the arXiv preprint server.          Space scientists have known of the existence of galaxy M64 for two and a half centuries\u2014it is notorious for its ominous appearance which has given rise to its nickname; the evil eye. Prior study of the galaxy has shown that it is unique in that its inner parts spin in an opposite direction to its outer parts.This has led to speculation that the outer part was cannibalized from another nearby dwarf galaxy. Previous work has not, however, been able to find any evidence of the prior existence of the other galaxy. In this new effort, the researchers have finally found what the others had been looking for\u2014material near M64 that was left over from another smaller galaxy as it was cannibalized.To learn more about M64, the researchers studied data from the Subaru telescope's Hyper Suprime-Cam, looking at areas around the galaxy rather than at it directly. In so doing, they found evidence of a galactic halo\u2014they are known to form during galaxy mergers.And they also found a dense group of stars known as a shell\u2014such formations also arise during galaxy mergers; gravitational interactions push them together. The team then created a simulation to depict the shell and it showed it to be consistent with prior findings with other minor galaxy mergers\u2014where a smaller galaxy is pulled into a larger one.The team then confirmed what they had observed by studying data from Hubble. It allowed them to make estimates regarding the composition and mass of the galaxy that they suspected had been absorbed.They found both to be similar to the Small Magellanic Cloud, which is a small galaxy close to the Milky Way Galaxy\u2014prior research has shown that it is slowly being cannibalized. The density was found to be approximately 500 million solar masses, which is roughly equivalent to the mass of the hydrogen disk forming the outer part of galaxy M64.The researchers conclude by suggesting that taken together, their work offers a strong argument for cannibalization of a dwarf galaxy as the source of the outer hydrogen disk of galaxy M64.

  "text": "Two Southwest Research Institute scientists were part of a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) team that observed a towering plume of water vapor more than 6,000 miles long\u2014roughly the distance from the U.S. to Japan\u2014spewing from the surface of Saturn's moon, Enceladus. In light of this NASA JWST Cycle 1 discovery, SwRI's Dr. Christopher Glein also received a Cycle 2 allocation to study the plume as well as key chemical compounds on the surface, to better understand the potential habitability of this ocean world.          During its 13-year reconnaissance of the Saturn system, the Cassini spacecraft discovered that Enceladus has a subsurface ocean of liquid water, and Cassini analyzed samples as plumes of ice grains and water vapor erupted into space from cracks in the moon's icy surface.\"Enceladus is one of the most dynamic objects in the solar system and is a prime target in humanity's search for life beyond Earth,\" said Glein, a leading expert in extraterrestrial oceanography. He is a co-author of a paper recently accepted by Nature Astronomy. \"In the years since NASA's Cassini spacecraft first looked at Enceladus, we never cease to be amazed by what we find is happening on this extraordinary moon.\"Once again, the latest observations made with Webb's Near InfraRed Spectrograph have yielded remarkable results.\"When I was looking at the data, at first, I was thinking I had to be wrong, it was just so shocking to map a plume more than 20 times the diameter of the moon,\" said Geronimo Villanueva of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and lead author of the recent paper. \"The plume extends far beyond what we could have imagined.\"Webb's sensitivity reveals a new story about Enceladus and how it feeds the water supply for the entire system of Saturn and its rings. As Enceladus whips around the gas giant in just 33 hours, the moon spews water, leaving a halo, almost like a donut, in its wake. The plume is not only huge, but the water spreads across Saturn's dense E-ring. JWST data indicate that roughly 30 percent of the water stays in the moon's wake, while the other 70 percent escapes to supply the rest of the Saturnian system.\"The Webb observations, for the first time, are visually illustrating how the moon's water vapor plumes are playing a role in the formation of the torus,\" said SwRI's Dr. Silvia Protopapa, an expert in the compositional analysis of icy bodies in the solar system who was also on the Cycle 1 team. \"This serves as a stunning testament to Webb's extraordinary abilities. I'm thrilled to be part of the Cycle 2 team as we initiate our search for new indications of habitability and plume activity on Enceladus.\"Spurred by the incredible findings from Webb's first fleeting glimpse of Enceladus, Glein is leading the same team that will observe Enceladus again with JWST in the next year.\"We will search for specific indicators of habitability, such as organic signatures and hydrogen peroxide,\" Glein said. \"Hydrogen peroxide is particularly interesting because it can provide much more potent sources of metabolic energy than what we previously identified. Cassini didn't give us a clear answer on the availability of such strong oxidants on Enceladus.\"The new observations will provide the best remote opportunity to search for habitability indicators on the surface, by boosting the signal-to-noise ratio by up to a factor of 10 compared with Cycle 1. Understanding the time variability of plume outgassing is also important to plan for future planetary science missions that target the plume.\"Webb can serve as a bridge between Cassini and the proposed search-for-life mission, Orbilander,\" Glein said. \"After Cycle 2, we will have a better idea if ocean samples are widely distributed over Enceladus's surface, as opposed to just near the south pole. These next observations could help us determine if Orbilander can access ocean samples near the equator, which may help us get back to Enceladus sooner.\"The team's results were accepted for publication on May 17, 2023, in Nature Astronomy, and a pre-print pdf is available.

  "answer_squad": " a measure of the non-Gaussianity of primordial fluctuations generated during inflation",
  "text": "A team of cosmologists from the University of Paris-Saclay, CNRS/IN2P3, Jagiellonian University and the University of Geneva derived a general expression for the bispectrum in bouncing cosmologies and then compared the results with Planck data, finding that it rules out most bouncing models. In their study, reported in the journal Physical Review Letters, the group derived measures of the non-Gaussianity of the primordial fluctuations generated during inflation in the early universe.          Because the beginning of the universe, if there was one, was so long ago, and because so little evidence has survived to this point in time, cosmologists and astrophysicists have trouble settling on a theory to describe the means by which the universe likely got its start. But they have settled on two main possibilities: that the whole thing started with a big bang, or that there was a bounce.The first idea suggests that there was a single moment in time when a gigantic explosion occurred, releasing the components that evolved to become what is now the universe. The second idea suggests that the big bang idea is not feasible because it proposes that the universe emerged from nothing\u2014proponents of the bouncing theory suggest there was a prior universe that collapsed and then expanded again.Most bouncing theories suggest this could have happened repeatedly, perhaps an infinite number of times. Currently there are many more scientists behind the big bang theory.In this new effort, the research team took a look at the bispectrum\u2014a measure of the non-Gaussianity of primordial fluctuations generated during inflation\u2014or put another way, the means by which different parts of the universe should have interacted under a bouncing scenario.Notably, the bispectrum would not be included in images of the cosmic microwave background as it exists today, but as the researchers on this effort note, it should show up in frequencies in the early universe. And that was where the researchers put their focus. They derived expressions for it under a bouncing scenario and then compared the results with previously derived Planck data. They found the bispectrum to be highly constrained and therefore ruled out bouncing models with a 95% confidence level.

  "answer_squad": " Omuamua",
  "text": "A quartet of space scientists, two from Carnegie Mellon University and two from Harvard University, has found via simulations that it should be possible for interstellar objects to be captured by Earth's gravity. The team, made up of Diptajyoti Mukherjee, Hy Trac, Amir Siraj and Abraham Loeb, has submitted a paper describing their work to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society\u2014currently, it can be read on the arXiv preprint server.          Back in 2017, an object in the solar system (subsequently named 'Oumuamua) was discovered to have come from outside of the solar system, making it the first observed interstellar object (ISO). Two years later, comet 2I Borisov was found to have come from outside the solar system, as well.The two visits to our solar system generated a wave of interest in the space community surrounding ISOs. Thus far, no more have been discovered, but many in the space science community believe that it is likely that some ISOs have traveled into our solar system, but instead of escaping, became trapped either in a loop around the sun or around one of the planets. In this new effort, the research team looked into the possibility of such occurrences using numerical analysis and simulations.Prior research into the topic focused almost exclusively on ISOs being captured by the sun or by Jupiter. Because of that, the researchers chose to make their main focus capture of ISOs by Earth.Via simulations, the team found that it should be possible for an ISO to be caught in a planetary orbit around Earth, but it was 1,000 times more likely to happen to Jupiter. Their simulations also showed that if an ISO were to be captured by Earth's gravity, it would likely have an unstable orbit, meaning its capture would likely be brief, mostly due to the pull of gravity from the other planets.The researchers were not willing to make any guesses based on their simulations about the likelihood of ISOs currently residing in the solar system, but suggest future work should look into the possibility. They conclude by noting such work will be extremely difficult due to the small size of such objects.

  "answer_squad": " the intracluster medium",
  "text": "The jellyfish galaxy JW39 hangs serenely in this image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. This galaxy lies over 900 million light-years away in the constellation Coma Berenices and is one of several jellyfish galaxies Hubble has been studying over the past two years.       Despite this jellyfish galaxy's serene appearance, it is adrift in a ferociously hostile environment: a galaxy cluster. Compared to their more isolated counterparts, the galaxies in galaxy clusters are often distorted by the gravitational pull of larger neighbors, which can twist galaxies into a variety of shapes.If that was not enough, the space between galaxies in a cluster is also pervaded with a searingly hot plasma known as the intracluster medium. While this plasma is extremely tenuous, galaxies moving through it experience it almost like swimmers fighting against a current, and this interaction can strip galaxies of their star-forming gas.This interaction between the intracluster medium and the galaxies is called ram-pressure stripping and is the process responsible for the trailing tendrils of this jellyfish galaxy. As JW39 moved through the cluster, the pressure of the intracluster medium stripped away gas and dust into long trailing ribbons of star formation that now stretch away from the disk of the galaxy.Astronomers using Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 studied these trailing tendrils in detail, as they are a particularly extreme environment for star formation. Surprisingly, they found that star formation in the 'tentacles' of jellyfish galaxies was not noticeably different from star formation in the galaxy disk.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the planet discovered by Kepler?",
  "answer_squad": " EPIC 246251988 b",
  "text": "More than 5,000 planets are confirmed to exist beyond our solar system. Over half were discovered by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope, a resilient observatory that far outlasted its original planned mission. Over nine and a half years, the spacecraft trailed the Earth, scanning the skies for periodic dips in starlight that could signal the presence of a planet crossing in front of its star.          In its last days, the telescope kept recording the brightness of stars as it was running out of fuel. On Oct. 30, 2018, its fuel tanks depleted, the spacecraft was officially retired.Now, astronomers at MIT and the University of Wisconsin at Madison, with the help of citizen scientists, have discovered what may be the last planets that Kepler gazed upon before going dark.The team combed through the telescope's last week of high-quality data and spotted three stars, in the same part of the sky, that appeared to dim briefly. The scientists determined that two of the stars each host a planet, while the third hosts a planet \"candidate\" that has yet to be verified.The two validated planets are K2-416 b, a planet that is about 2.6 times the size of the Earth and that orbits its star about every 13 days, and K2-417 b, a slightly larger planet that is just over three times Earth's size and that circles its star every 6.5 days. For their size and proximity to their stars, both planets are considered \"hot mini-Neptunes .\" They are located about 400 light years from Earth.The planet candidate is EPIC 246251988 b\u2014the largest of the three worlds at almost four times the size of the Earth. This Neptune-sized candidate orbits its star in around 10 days, and is slightly farther away, 1,200 light years from Earth.\"We have found what are probably the last planets ever discovered by Kepler, in data taken while the spacecraft was literally running on fumes,\" says Andrew Vanderburg, assistant professor of physics in MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. \"The planets themselves are not particularly unusual, but their atypical discovery and historical importance makes them interesting.\"The team has published their discovery today in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Vanderburg's co-authors are lead author Elyse Incha, at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, and amateur astronomers Tom Jacobs and Daryll LaCourse, along with scientists at NASA, the Center for Astrophysics of Harvard and the Smithsonian, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.      Data squeezeIn 2009, NASA launched the Kepler telescope into space, where it followed the Earth's orbit and continuously monitored millions of stars in a patch of the northern sky. Over four years, the telescope recorded the brightness of over 150,000 stars, which astronomers used to discover thousands of possible planets beyond our solar system.Kepler kept observing beyond its original three-and-a-half-year mission, until May 2013, when the second of four reaction wheels failed. The wheels served as the spacecraft's gyroscopes, helping to keep the telescope pointed at a particular point in the sky. Kepler's observations were put on pause while scientists searched for a fix.One year later, Kepler restarted as \"K2,\" a reworked mission that used the sun's wind to balance the unsteady spacecraft in a way that kept the telescope relatively stable for a few months at a time\u2014a period called a campaign. K2 went on for another four years, observing over half a million more stars before the spacecraft finally ran out of fuel during its 19th campaign. The data from this last campaign comprised only a week of high-quality observations and another 10 days of noisier measurements as the spacecraft rapidly lost fuel.\"We were curious to see whether we could get anything useful out of this short dataset,\" Vanderburg says. \"We tried to see what last information we could squeeze out of it.\"By eyeVanderburg and Incha presented the challenge to the Visual Survey Group, a team of amateur and professional astronomers who hunt for exoplanets in satellite data. They search by eye through thousands of recorded light curves of each star, looking for characteristic dips in brightness that signal a \"transit,\" or the possible crossing of a planet in front of its star.The citizen scientists are especially suited to combing through short datasets such as K2's very last campaign.\"They can distinguish transits from other wacky things like a glitch in the instrument,\" Vanderburg says. \"That's helpful especially when your data quality begins to suffer, like it did in K2's last bit of data.\"The astronomers spent a few days efficiently looking through the light curves that Kepler recorded from about 33,000 stars. The team worked with only a week's worth of high-quality data from the telescope before it began to lose fuel and focus. Even in this short window of data, the team was able to spot a single transit in three different stars.Incha and Vanderburg then looked at the telescope's very last, lower-quality observations, taken in its last 11 days of operation, to see if they could spot any additional transits in the same three stars\u2014evidence that a planet was periodically circling its star.During this 11-day period, as the spacecraft was losing fuel, its thrusters fired more erratically, causing the telescope's view to drift. In their analysis, the team focused on the region of each star's light curves between thruster activity, to see if they could spot any additional transits in these less data-noisy moments.This search revealed a second transit for K2-416 b and K2-417 b, validating that they each host a planet. The team also detected a similar dip in brightness for K2-417 b in data taken of the same star by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), a mission that is led and operated by MIT. Data from TESS helped to confirm the planet candidate around this star.\"Those two are pretty much, without a doubt, planets,\" Incha says. \"We also followed up with ground-based observations to rule out all kinds of false positive scenarios for them, including background star interference, and close-in stellar binaries.\"\"These are the last chronologically observed planets by Kepler, but every bit of the telescope's data is incredibly useful,\" Incha says. \"We want to make sure none of that data goes to waste, because there are still a lot of discoveries to be made.\" More information:Elyse Incha et al, Kepler's Last Planet Discoveries: Two New Planets and One Single-Transit Candidate from K2 Campaign 19, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (2023).

  "text": "An international team of astronomers has analyzed the data from the latest phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). They discovered eight new cataclysmic variables (CV) systems. The finding is reported in a paper published May 22 on the arXiv pre-print server.          CVs are binary star systems consisting of a white dwarf primary that is accreting matter from a normal star companion. They irregularly increase in brightness by a large factor, then drop back down to a quiescent state. These binaries have been found in many environments, such as the center of the Milky Way galaxy, the solar neighborhood, and within open and globular clusters.SDSS is an important tool in the search for CVs as so far more than 500 objects of this type have been identified as part of this survey. The project has now entered its fifth phase (SDSS-V), which extends multi-object spectroscopy across the entire sky by operating robotic fiber positioners on the 2.5 m SDSS telescope at Apache Point Observatory (APO) and at the 2.5 m Dupont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory.Given that SDSS-V contains a program to deliberately target white dwarfs and cataclysmic variable systems, a group of astronomers led by Keith Inight of the University of Warwick, UK, decided to use it in order to search for new CVs and to characterize the ones already detected.\"SDSS-V is, for the first time, carrying out a dedicated survey of white dwarfs, both single and in binaries. We have analyzed the SDSS-V spectra of CVs and CV candidates observed as part of the final plug-plate operations of SDSS, and we discovered eight new CVs,\" the researchers wrote in the paper.Out of the eight newly discovered cataclysmic variables, four turned out to be WZ Sagittae (WZ Sge) systems\u2014non-magnetic CVs showcasing low accretion rate and rare superoutbursts. There is also one nova-like (NL) CV, one of the SU Ursae Majoris (SU UMa) subtype and one polar (due to the presence of a very strong magnetic field in its white dwarf). The subclass of the remaining one CV is yet to be determined.According to the study, none of the newly identified CVs displays noticeable changes in brightness in their light curves. The orbital periods of all these eight CVs were measured to be below 94 minutes, which is typical for old, low accretion rate systems. This suggests that SDSS-V will continue to increase the proportion of short-period cataclysmic variables among the known population of CVs.\"This is consistent with previous findings that spectroscopically identified CVs have a larger proportion of short-period systems compared to samples identified from photometric variability,\" the authors of the paper noted.Besides the detection of new cataclysmic variables, the astronomers also spectroscopically confirmed 53 and refuted 11 other CV candidates. Moreover, they were able to measure orbital periods for 21 CV systems. More information:K.

  "text": "China sent three astronauts to its Tiangong space station on Tuesday, putting a civilian into orbit for the first time as it pursues plans to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2030.          The world's second-largest economy has invested billions of dollars in its military-run space program in a push to catch up with the United States and Russia.The Shenzhou-16 crew took off atop a Long March 2F rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northwest China at 9:31 am (0131 GMT), AFP journalists saw.They docked at the space station's Tianhe core module on Tuesday afternoon, more than six hours after taking off, state broadcaster CCTV said.The launch was a \"complete success\" and the \"astronauts are in good condition\", said Zou Lipeng, director of the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.Dozens of employees from the space program, many of whom live year-round on the huge site, attended the launch, snapping selfies with the rocket in the background.Children played as they waited for the launch, some waving Chinese flags as they sat on their parents' shoulders.Spectators let out a loud \"wow\", shouting \"good luck\" and waving as the rocket took off in a cloud of ochre smoke.Leading its crew is commander Jing Haipeng on his fourth mission, as well as engineer Zhu Yangzhu and Beihang University professor Gui Haichao, the first Chinese civilian in space.China was the third country to put humans in orbit and Tiangong is the crown jewel of its space program, which has also landed robotic rovers on Mars and the Moon.Shenzhou-16 is the first mission to Tiangong since it entered its \"application and development\" stage, authorities said.The crew will meet their three colleagues from the Shenzhou-15 flight, who have been at the station for six months and who will return to Earth in the coming days.Shenzhou-16's crew will carry out a number of experiments during the mission, including in \"high-precision space time-frequency systems\", general relativity, and into the origin of life, China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) spokesperson Lin Xiqiang told reporters on Monday.The space station was resupplied with drinking water, clothing, food and propellant this month in preparation for Shenzhou-16's arrival.One expert told AFP that Tuesday's mission represented \"a regular crew rotation flight\", but even that was significant.\"Accumulating depth of experience in human spaceflight operations is important and doesn't involve new spectacular milestones all the time,\" said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer and astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.'Heavenly palace'China's \"space dream\" has been put into overdrive under President Xi Jinping, and the construction of a moon base is planned.\"The overall goal is to achieve China's first crewed landing on the Moon by 2030 and carry out lunar scientific exploration and related technological experiments,\" the CMSA's Lin said.The final module of Tiangong\u2014which means \"heavenly palace\"\u2014successfully docked with the core structure last year.The station carries several pieces of cutting-edge scientific equipment, state news agency Xinhua reported, including \"the world's first space-based cold atomic clock system\".Tiangong is expected to remain in low Earth orbit at an altitude between 400 and 450 kilometers (250 and 280 miles) for at least 10 years.It is constantly crewed by rotating teams of three astronauts.China has been effectively excluded from the International Space Station since 2011, when the United States banned NASA from engaging with the country\u2014pushing Beijing to develop its own orbital outpost.China's space agency reiterated on Monday it is actively seeking international cooperation in the project.China plans to send two crewed space missions to Tiangong every year, according to the CMSA.The next will be Shenzhou-17, with an expected launch in October.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Chinese mission with first civilian reaches space station (2023, May 30)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-chinese-mission-civilian-space-station.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the method that is used to calibrate sun sensors?",
  "answer_squad": " deep learning",
  "text": "A spacecraft can estimate the attitude state by comparing external measurements from attitude sensors with reference information. CubeSats tend to use 4-quadrant analog solar sensors which have the advantages of extremely low power consumption, minimal volume, low complexity, low cost, and high reliability as attitude sensors, considering the limitation of satellite volume and payload. The performance of the sensor can be importantly improved by the calibration procedure and compensation model.          However, the various error sources affecting the calibration of the 4-quadrant sun sensor lead to a complicated process of compensation model establishment. Deep learning, which is widely used in the aerospace field in recent years, is able to approximate any continuous function on a bounded closed set, providing new ideas for solving the traditional problem.In a research paper recently published in Space: Science & Technology, authors from Northwestern Polytechnical University, German Aerospace Center, and Dalian University of Technology together propose a method to calibrate sun sensors by deep learning, which not only is able to integrate the influence of various errors but also avoids the need of analyzing and modeling every single error.Authors first explain the calibration process of sun sensor based on cubic surface fitting. The calibration and testing platform of the sun sensor includes a solar simulation light source, high-precision 2-axis turntable, and servo controller. The outputs of the sun sensor are the incidence \u03bb and azimuth \u03c5, whose theoretical values are obtained from the angle of the turntable and actual values are measured by the sun sensor. There are large errors between the theoretical and actual values, up to 3\u00b0.By substituting the theoretical and actual values into the 3-order surface fitting formula, the cubic surface fitting model are obtained. The output value of the analog sun sensor is corrected by the cubic surface fitting model and the error is effectively reduced. However, there're larger errors close to the edge of FOV (field of view) of the sun sensor.Then, authors introduce the learning and training of the deep neural network model, which approximates the actual error model and is used for error correction. In the calibration experiment of the analog sun sensor, the deep feedforward neural network is selected to fit the error model, where ReLU (linear rectification function) is selected as the activation function, a full connection as the connection mode between 2 adjacent layers, and the mean square error (MSE) as the loss function. The neural network is trained through gradient descent algorithm and the backpropagation algorithm.Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified using experimental data. In the calibration experiment of an analog sun sensor, the training of the network model is divided into two stages: the dataset is generated by the cubic surface fitting model in the initial training stage while the deep network model adopts the measured data for learning in the final training stage.Additionally, learning data are normalized to the magnitude between 0 and 1 via the max\u2013min method. After network learning in the initial stage, the error between the output of the network model and the estimated value of the cubic surface fitting model is concentrated within 0.02\u00b0, indicating that the deep network model at this time can better map the cubic surface fitting model.In the final training stage of the feedforward neural network model, the calibration error of the incident angle can reach 0.1\u00b0 (1\u03c3) and 0.25\u00b0 (3\u03c3), which greatly improves the calibration effect of the cubic surface fitting model. These results shows that the method can effectively eliminate deterministic errors, including spot distortion and assembly errors.

  "text": "The Breakthrough Listen Investigation for Periodic Spectral Signals (BLIPSS), led by Akshay Suresh, Cornell doctoral candidate in astronomy, is pioneering a search for periodic signals emanating from the core of our galaxy, the Milky Way. The research aims to detect repetitive patterns, a way to search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) within our cosmic neighborhood.          The researchers developed software based on a Fast Folding Algorithm (FFA), an efficient search method offering enhanced sensitivity to periodic sequences of narrow pulses. Their paper, \"A 4\u20138 GHz Galactic Center Search for Periodic Technosignatures,\" was published May 30 in The Astronomical Journal.Pulsars\u2014rapidly rotating neutron stars that sweep beams of radio energy across the Earth\u2014are natural astrophysical objects that generate periodic signals but humans also use directed periodic transmissions for a variety of applications, including radar. Such signals would be a good way to get someone's attention across interstellar space, standing out from the background of non-periodic signals, as well as using much less energy than a transmitter that is broadcasting continuously.\"BLIPSS is an example of cutting-edge software as a science multiplier for SETI,\" said Suresh. \"Our study introduces to SETI, for the first time, the Fast Folding Algorithm; our open-source software utilizes an FFA to crunch over 1.5 million time series for periodic signals in roughly 30 minutes.\"                Detection of a target periodic spectral signal using blipss.

Right: radio frequency-period (P) diagram showing the detection of a P0 = 30 s signal in the central spectral channel. The first harmonic (cross) and the first subharmonic (plus) of the fundamental signal frequency (f0 = 1/P0) are also detected at P = 15 s and P = 60 s, respectively. Credit: The Astronomical Journal (2023). DOI: 10.3847/1538-3881/acccf0             BLIPSS is a collaborative effort between Cornell, the SETI Institute, and Breakthrough Listen. The project significantly enhances the probability of capturing evidence of extraterrestrial technology by focusing on the central region of the Milky Way, known for its dense concentration of stars and potentially habitable exoplanets. The center of the Milky Way would also be an ideal place for aliens to place a beacon to contact large swaths of the Galaxy.The team tested their algorithm on known pulsars and were able to detect periodic emission as expected. They then turned to a larger dataset of scans of the Galactic Center undertaken using the Breakthrough Listen instrument on the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia. In contrast to pulsars, which emit across a wide swath of radio frequencies, BLIPSS looked for repeating signals in a narrower range of frequencies, covering less than one-tenth of the width of an average FM radio station.\"The combination of these relatively narrow bandwidths with periodic patterns could be indicative of deliberate technological activities of intelligent civilizations,\" said co-author Steve Croft, Breakthrough Listen project scientist. \"Breakthrough Listen captures huge volumes of data, and Akshay's technique provides a new method to help us search that haystack for needles that could provide tantalizing evidence of advanced extraterrestrial life forms.\"\"Until now, radio SETI has primarily dedicated its efforts to the search for continuous signals,\" said co-author Vishal Gajjar, a SETI Institute astronomer. \"Our study sheds light on the remarkable energy efficiency of a train of pulses as a means of interstellar communication across vast distances.

  "text": "An international team of astronomers, astrophysicists and cosmologists, has found evidence of galaxy M64's outer disk originating from a smaller, nearby, dwarf galaxy. The team has written a paper describing their findings that has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters\u2014in the meantime, it can be read on the arXiv preprint server.          Space scientists have known of the existence of galaxy M64 for two and a half centuries\u2014it is notorious for its ominous appearance which has given rise to its nickname; the evil eye. Prior study of the galaxy has shown that it is unique in that its inner parts spin in an opposite direction to its outer parts.This has led to speculation that the outer part was cannibalized from another nearby dwarf galaxy. Previous work has not, however, been able to find any evidence of the prior existence of the other galaxy. In this new effort, the researchers have finally found what the others had been looking for\u2014material near M64 that was left over from another smaller galaxy as it was cannibalized.To learn more about M64, the researchers studied data from the Subaru telescope's Hyper Suprime-Cam, looking at areas around the galaxy rather than at it directly. In so doing, they found evidence of a galactic halo\u2014they are known to form during galaxy mergers.And they also found a dense group of stars known as a shell\u2014such formations also arise during galaxy mergers; gravitational interactions push them together. The team then created a simulation to depict the shell and it showed it to be consistent with prior findings with other minor galaxy mergers\u2014where a smaller galaxy is pulled into a larger one.The team then confirmed what they had observed by studying data from Hubble. It allowed them to make estimates regarding the composition and mass of the galaxy that they suspected had been absorbed.They found both to be similar to the Small Magellanic Cloud, which is a small galaxy close to the Milky Way Galaxy\u2014prior research has shown that it is slowly being cannibalized. The density was found to be approximately 500 million solar masses, which is roughly equivalent to the mass of the hydrogen disk forming the outer part of galaxy M64.The researchers conclude by suggesting that taken together, their work offers a strong argument for cannibalization of a dwarf galaxy as the source of the outer hydrogen disk of galaxy M64.

  "text": "Two Southwest Research Institute scientists were part of a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) team that observed a towering plume of water vapor more than 6,000 miles long\u2014roughly the distance from the U.S. to Japan\u2014spewing from the surface of Saturn's moon, Enceladus. In light of this NASA JWST Cycle 1 discovery, SwRI's Dr. Christopher Glein also received a Cycle 2 allocation to study the plume as well as key chemical compounds on the surface, to better understand the potential habitability of this ocean world.          During its 13-year reconnaissance of the Saturn system, the Cassini spacecraft discovered that Enceladus has a subsurface ocean of liquid water, and Cassini analyzed samples as plumes of ice grains and water vapor erupted into space from cracks in the moon's icy surface.\"Enceladus is one of the most dynamic objects in the solar system and is a prime target in humanity's search for life beyond Earth,\" said Glein, a leading expert in extraterrestrial oceanography. He is a co-author of a paper recently accepted by Nature Astronomy. \"In the years since NASA's Cassini spacecraft first looked at Enceladus, we never cease to be amazed by what we find is happening on this extraordinary moon.\"Once again, the latest observations made with Webb's Near InfraRed Spectrograph have yielded remarkable results.\"When I was looking at the data, at first, I was thinking I had to be wrong, it was just so shocking to map a plume more than 20 times the diameter of the moon,\" said Geronimo Villanueva of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and lead author of the recent paper. \"The plume extends far beyond what we could have imagined.\"Webb's sensitivity reveals a new story about Enceladus and how it feeds the water supply for the entire system of Saturn and its rings. As Enceladus whips around the gas giant in just 33 hours, the moon spews water, leaving a halo, almost like a donut, in its wake. The plume is not only huge, but the water spreads across Saturn's dense E-ring. JWST data indicate that roughly 30 percent of the water stays in the moon's wake, while the other 70 percent escapes to supply the rest of the Saturnian system.\"The Webb observations, for the first time, are visually illustrating how the moon's water vapor plumes are playing a role in the formation of the torus,\" said SwRI's Dr. Silvia Protopapa, an expert in the compositional analysis of icy bodies in the solar system who was also on the Cycle 1 team. \"This serves as a stunning testament to Webb's extraordinary abilities. I'm thrilled to be part of the Cycle 2 team as we initiate our search for new indications of habitability and plume activity on Enceladus.\"Spurred by the incredible findings from Webb's first fleeting glimpse of Enceladus, Glein is leading the same team that will observe Enceladus again with JWST in the next year.\"We will search for specific indicators of habitability, such as organic signatures and hydrogen peroxide,\" Glein said. \"Hydrogen peroxide is particularly interesting because it can provide much more potent sources of metabolic energy than what we previously identified. Cassini didn't give us a clear answer on the availability of such strong oxidants on Enceladus.\"The new observations will provide the best remote opportunity to search for habitability indicators on the surface, by boosting the signal-to-noise ratio by up to a factor of 10 compared with Cycle 1. Understanding the time variability of plume outgassing is also important to plan for future planetary science missions that target the plume.\"Webb can serve as a bridge between Cassini and the proposed search-for-life mission, Orbilander,\" Glein said. \"After Cycle 2, we will have a better idea if ocean samples are widely distributed over Enceladus's surface, as opposed to just near the south pole. These next observations could help us determine if Orbilander can access ocean samples near the equator, which may help us get back to Enceladus sooner.\"The team's results were accepted for publication on May 17, 2023, in Nature Astronomy, and a pre-print pdf is available.

  "text": "A team of cosmologists from the University of Paris-Saclay, CNRS/IN2P3, Jagiellonian University and the University of Geneva derived a general expression for the bispectrum in bouncing cosmologies and then compared the results with Planck data, finding that it rules out most bouncing models. In their study, reported in the journal Physical Review Letters, the group derived measures of the non-Gaussianity of the primordial fluctuations generated during inflation in the early universe.          Because the beginning of the universe, if there was one, was so long ago, and because so little evidence has survived to this point in time, cosmologists and astrophysicists have trouble settling on a theory to describe the means by which the universe likely got its start. But they have settled on two main possibilities: that the whole thing started with a big bang, or that there was a bounce.The first idea suggests that there was a single moment in time when a gigantic explosion occurred, releasing the components that evolved to become what is now the universe. The second idea suggests that the big bang idea is not feasible because it proposes that the universe emerged from nothing\u2014proponents of the bouncing theory suggest there was a prior universe that collapsed and then expanded again.Most bouncing theories suggest this could have happened repeatedly, perhaps an infinite number of times. Currently there are many more scientists behind the big bang theory.In this new effort, the research team took a look at the bispectrum\u2014a measure of the non-Gaussianity of primordial fluctuations generated during inflation\u2014or put another way, the means by which different parts of the universe should have interacted under a bouncing scenario.Notably, the bispectrum would not be included in images of the cosmic microwave background as it exists today, but as the researchers on this effort note, it should show up in frequencies in the early universe. And that was where the researchers put their focus. They derived expressions for it under a bouncing scenario and then compared the results with previously derived Planck data. They found the bispectrum to be highly constrained and therefore ruled out bouncing models with a 95% confidence level.

  "text": "A quartet of space scientists, two from Carnegie Mellon University and two from Harvard University, has found via simulations that it should be possible for interstellar objects to be captured by Earth's gravity. The team, made up of Diptajyoti Mukherjee, Hy Trac, Amir Siraj and Abraham Loeb, has submitted a paper describing their work to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society\u2014currently, it can be read on the arXiv preprint server.          Back in 2017, an object in the solar system (subsequently named 'Oumuamua) was discovered to have come from outside of the solar system, making it the first observed interstellar object (ISO). Two years later, comet 2I Borisov was found to have come from outside the solar system, as well.The two visits to our solar system generated a wave of interest in the space community surrounding ISOs. Thus far, no more have been discovered, but many in the space science community believe that it is likely that some ISOs have traveled into our solar system, but instead of escaping, became trapped either in a loop around the sun or around one of the planets. In this new effort, the research team looked into the possibility of such occurrences using numerical analysis and simulations.Prior research into the topic focused almost exclusively on ISOs being captured by the sun or by Jupiter. Because of that, the researchers chose to make their main focus capture of ISOs by Earth.Via simulations, the team found that it should be possible for an ISO to be caught in a planetary orbit around Earth, but it was 1,000 times more likely to happen to Jupiter. Their simulations also showed that if an ISO were to be captured by Earth's gravity, it would likely have an unstable orbit, meaning its capture would likely be brief, mostly due to the pull of gravity from the other planets.The researchers were not willing to make any guesses based on their simulations about the likelihood of ISOs currently residing in the solar system, but suggest future work should look into the possibility. They conclude by noting such work will be extremely difficult due to the small size of such objects.

  "answer_squad": " the intracluster medium",
  "text": "The jellyfish galaxy JW39 hangs serenely in this image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. This galaxy lies over 900 million light-years away in the constellation Coma Berenices and is one of several jellyfish galaxies Hubble has been studying over the past two years.       Despite this jellyfish galaxy's serene appearance, it is adrift in a ferociously hostile environment: a galaxy cluster. Compared to their more isolated counterparts, the galaxies in galaxy clusters are often distorted by the gravitational pull of larger neighbors, which can twist galaxies into a variety of shapes.If that was not enough, the space between galaxies in a cluster is also pervaded with a searingly hot plasma known as the intracluster medium. While this plasma is extremely tenuous, galaxies moving through it experience it almost like swimmers fighting against a current, and this interaction can strip galaxies of their star-forming gas.This interaction between the intracluster medium and the galaxies is called ram-pressure stripping and is the process responsible for the trailing tendrils of this jellyfish galaxy. As JW39 moved through the cluster, the pressure of the intracluster medium stripped away gas and dust into long trailing ribbons of star formation that now stretch away from the disk of the galaxy.Astronomers using Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 studied these trailing tendrils in detail, as they are a particularly extreme environment for star formation. Surprisingly, they found that star formation in the 'tentacles' of jellyfish galaxies was not noticeably different from star formation in the galaxy disk.

  "text": "More than 5,000 planets are confirmed to exist beyond our solar system. Over half were discovered by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope, a resilient observatory that far outlasted its original planned mission. Over nine and a half years, the spacecraft trailed the Earth, scanning the skies for periodic dips in starlight that could signal the presence of a planet crossing in front of its star.          In its last days, the telescope kept recording the brightness of stars as it was running out of fuel. On Oct. 30, 2018, its fuel tanks depleted, the spacecraft was officially retired.Now, astronomers at MIT and the University of Wisconsin at Madison, with the help of citizen scientists, have discovered what may be the last planets that Kepler gazed upon before going dark.The team combed through the telescope's last week of high-quality data and spotted three stars, in the same part of the sky, that appeared to dim briefly. The scientists determined that two of the stars each host a planet, while the third hosts a planet \"candidate\" that has yet to be verified.The two validated planets are K2-416 b, a planet that is about 2.6 times the size of the Earth and that orbits its star about every 13 days, and K2-417 b, a slightly larger planet that is just over three times Earth's size and that circles its star every 6.5 days. For their size and proximity to their stars, both planets are considered \"hot mini-Neptunes .\" They are located about 400 light years from Earth.The planet candidate is EPIC 246251988 b\u2014the largest of the three worlds at almost four times the size of the Earth. This Neptune-sized candidate orbits its star in around 10 days, and is slightly farther away, 1,200 light years from Earth.\"We have found what are probably the last planets ever discovered by Kepler, in data taken while the spacecraft was literally running on fumes,\" says Andrew Vanderburg, assistant professor of physics in MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. \"The planets themselves are not particularly unusual, but their atypical discovery and historical importance makes them interesting.\"The team has published their discovery today in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Vanderburg's co-authors are lead author Elyse Incha, at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, and amateur astronomers Tom Jacobs and Daryll LaCourse, along with scientists at NASA, the Center for Astrophysics of Harvard and the Smithsonian, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.      Data squeezeIn 2009, NASA launched the Kepler telescope into space, where it followed the Earth's orbit and continuously monitored millions of stars in a patch of the northern sky. Over four years, the telescope recorded the brightness of over 150,000 stars, which astronomers used to discover thousands of possible planets beyond our solar system.Kepler kept observing beyond its original three-and-a-half-year mission, until May 2013, when the second of four reaction wheels failed. The wheels served as the spacecraft's gyroscopes, helping to keep the telescope pointed at a particular point in the sky. Kepler's observations were put on pause while scientists searched for a fix.One year later, Kepler restarted as \"K2,\" a reworked mission that used the sun's wind to balance the unsteady spacecraft in a way that kept the telescope relatively stable for a few months at a time\u2014a period called a campaign. K2 went on for another four years, observing over half a million more stars before the spacecraft finally ran out of fuel during its 19th campaign. The data from this last campaign comprised only a week of high-quality observations and another 10 days of noisier measurements as the spacecraft rapidly lost fuel.\"We were curious to see whether we could get anything useful out of this short dataset,\" Vanderburg says. \"We tried to see what last information we could squeeze out of it.\"By eyeVanderburg and Incha presented the challenge to the Visual Survey Group, a team of amateur and professional astronomers who hunt for exoplanets in satellite data. They search by eye through thousands of recorded light curves of each star, looking for characteristic dips in brightness that signal a \"transit,\" or the possible crossing of a planet in front of its star.The citizen scientists are especially suited to combing through short datasets such as K2's very last campaign.\"They can distinguish transits from other wacky things like a glitch in the instrument,\" Vanderburg says. \"That's helpful especially when your data quality begins to suffer, like it did in K2's last bit of data.\"The astronomers spent a few days efficiently looking through the light curves that Kepler recorded from about 33,000 stars. The team worked with only a week's worth of high-quality data from the telescope before it began to lose fuel and focus. Even in this short window of data, the team was able to spot a single transit in three different stars.Incha and Vanderburg then looked at the telescope's very last, lower-quality observations, taken in its last 11 days of operation, to see if they could spot any additional transits in the same three stars\u2014evidence that a planet was periodically circling its star.During this 11-day period, as the spacecraft was losing fuel, its thrusters fired more erratically, causing the telescope's view to drift. In their analysis, the team focused on the region of each star's light curves between thruster activity, to see if they could spot any additional transits in these less data-noisy moments.This search revealed a second transit for K2-416 b and K2-417 b, validating that they each host a planet. The team also detected a similar dip in brightness for K2-417 b in data taken of the same star by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), a mission that is led and operated by MIT. Data from TESS helped to confirm the planet candidate around this star.\"Those two are pretty much, without a doubt, planets,\" Incha says. \"We also followed up with ground-based observations to rule out all kinds of false positive scenarios for them, including background star interference, and close-in stellar binaries.\"\"These are the last chronologically observed planets by Kepler, but every bit of the telescope's data is incredibly useful,\" Incha says. \"We want to make sure none of that data goes to waste, because there are still a lot of discoveries to be made.\" More information:Elyse Incha et al, Kepler's Last Planet Discoveries: Two New Planets and One Single-Transit Candidate from K2 Campaign 19, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (2023).

  "text": "An international team of astronomers has analyzed the data from the latest phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). They discovered eight new cataclysmic variables (CV) systems. The finding is reported in a paper published May 22 on the arXiv pre-print server.          CVs are binary star systems consisting of a white dwarf primary that is accreting matter from a normal star companion. They irregularly increase in brightness by a large factor, then drop back down to a quiescent state. These binaries have been found in many environments, such as the center of the Milky Way galaxy, the solar neighborhood, and within open and globular clusters.SDSS is an important tool in the search for CVs as so far more than 500 objects of this type have been identified as part of this survey. The project has now entered its fifth phase (SDSS-V), which extends multi-object spectroscopy across the entire sky by operating robotic fiber positioners on the 2.5 m SDSS telescope at Apache Point Observatory (APO) and at the 2.5 m Dupont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory.Given that SDSS-V contains a program to deliberately target white dwarfs and cataclysmic variable systems, a group of astronomers led by Keith Inight of the University of Warwick, UK, decided to use it in order to search for new CVs and to characterize the ones already detected.\"SDSS-V is, for the first time, carrying out a dedicated survey of white dwarfs, both single and in binaries. We have analyzed the SDSS-V spectra of CVs and CV candidates observed as part of the final plug-plate operations of SDSS, and we discovered eight new CVs,\" the researchers wrote in the paper.Out of the eight newly discovered cataclysmic variables, four turned out to be WZ Sagittae (WZ Sge) systems\u2014non-magnetic CVs showcasing low accretion rate and rare superoutbursts. There is also one nova-like (NL) CV, one of the SU Ursae Majoris (SU UMa) subtype and one polar (due to the presence of a very strong magnetic field in its white dwarf). The subclass of the remaining one CV is yet to be determined.According to the study, none of the newly identified CVs displays noticeable changes in brightness in their light curves. The orbital periods of all these eight CVs were measured to be below 94 minutes, which is typical for old, low accretion rate systems. This suggests that SDSS-V will continue to increase the proportion of short-period cataclysmic variables among the known population of CVs.\"This is consistent with previous findings that spectroscopically identified CVs have a larger proportion of short-period systems compared to samples identified from photometric variability,\" the authors of the paper noted.Besides the detection of new cataclysmic variables, the astronomers also spectroscopically confirmed 53 and refuted 11 other CV candidates. Moreover, they were able to measure orbital periods for 21 CV systems. More information:K.

  "text": "China sent three astronauts to its Tiangong space station on Tuesday, putting a civilian into orbit for the first time as it pursues plans to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2030.          The world's second-largest economy has invested billions of dollars in its military-run space program in a push to catch up with the United States and Russia.The Shenzhou-16 crew took off atop a Long March 2F rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northwest China at 9:31 am (0131 GMT), AFP journalists saw.They docked at the space station's Tianhe core module on Tuesday afternoon, more than six hours after taking off, state broadcaster CCTV said.The launch was a \"complete success\" and the \"astronauts are in good condition\", said Zou Lipeng, director of the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.Dozens of employees from the space program, many of whom live year-round on the huge site, attended the launch, snapping selfies with the rocket in the background.Children played as they waited for the launch, some waving Chinese flags as they sat on their parents' shoulders.Spectators let out a loud \"wow\", shouting \"good luck\" and waving as the rocket took off in a cloud of ochre smoke.Leading its crew is commander Jing Haipeng on his fourth mission, as well as engineer Zhu Yangzhu and Beihang University professor Gui Haichao, the first Chinese civilian in space.China was the third country to put humans in orbit and Tiangong is the crown jewel of its space program, which has also landed robotic rovers on Mars and the Moon.Shenzhou-16 is the first mission to Tiangong since it entered its \"application and development\" stage, authorities said.The crew will meet their three colleagues from the Shenzhou-15 flight, who have been at the station for six months and who will return to Earth in the coming days.Shenzhou-16's crew will carry out a number of experiments during the mission, including in \"high-precision space time-frequency systems\", general relativity, and into the origin of life, China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) spokesperson Lin Xiqiang told reporters on Monday.The space station was resupplied with drinking water, clothing, food and propellant this month in preparation for Shenzhou-16's arrival.One expert told AFP that Tuesday's mission represented \"a regular crew rotation flight\", but even that was significant.\"Accumulating depth of experience in human spaceflight operations is important and doesn't involve new spectacular milestones all the time,\" said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer and astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.'Heavenly palace'China's \"space dream\" has been put into overdrive under President Xi Jinping, and the construction of a moon base is planned.\"The overall goal is to achieve China's first crewed landing on the Moon by 2030 and carry out lunar scientific exploration and related technological experiments,\" the CMSA's Lin said.The final module of Tiangong\u2014which means \"heavenly palace\"\u2014successfully docked with the core structure last year.The station carries several pieces of cutting-edge scientific equipment, state news agency Xinhua reported, including \"the world's first space-based cold atomic clock system\".Tiangong is expected to remain in low Earth orbit at an altitude between 400 and 450 kilometers (250 and 280 miles) for at least 10 years.It is constantly crewed by rotating teams of three astronauts.China has been effectively excluded from the International Space Station since 2011, when the United States banned NASA from engaging with the country\u2014pushing Beijing to develop its own orbital outpost.China's space agency reiterated on Monday it is actively seeking international cooperation in the project.China plans to send two crewed space missions to Tiangong every year, according to the CMSA.The next will be Shenzhou-17, with an expected launch in October.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Chinese mission with first civilian reaches space station (2023, May 30)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-chinese-mission-civilian-space-station.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "China successfully launched the latest mission to its Tiangong space station on Tuesday, with a crew that includes its first civilian astronaut.          It marked the latest space milestone for China, as it looks to catch up with the United States and Russia.Here is a look at the Chinese space program, and where it is headed:Mao's vowSoon after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik in 1957, Chinese leader Mao Zedong pronounced: \"We too will make satellites.\"It took more than a decade, but in 1970, China launched its first satellite on a Long March rocket.Human spaceflight took decades longer, with Yang Liwei becoming the first Chinese \"taikonaut\" in 2003.As the launch approached, concerns over the viability of the mission caused Beijing to cancel a live television broadcast at the last minute.But it went smoothly, with Yang orbiting the Earth 14 times during a 21-hour flight.Space station and 'Jade Rabbit'Following in the footsteps of the United States and Russia, China started planning for a space station of its own in Earth orbit.The Tiangong-1 lab was launched in 2011.In 2013, the second Chinese woman in space, Wang Yaping, gave a video class from that craft to children across the country.                The Jade Rabbit lunar rover surveyed the moon's surface for 31 months.             Tiangong-1 was also used for medical experiments and, most importantly, tests intended to prepare for the construction of a space station.That was followed by the \"Jade Rabbit\" lunar rover in 2013, which initially appeared to be a dud when it turned dormant and stopped sending signals back to Earth.It made a dramatic recovery, however, ultimately surveying the Moon's surface for 31 months\u2014well beyond its expected lifespan.In 2016, China launched its second orbital lab, the Tiangong-2. Astronauts who visited the station have run experiments on growing rice and other plants in space.'Space dream'Under President Xi Jinping, plans for China's \"space dream\" have been put into overdrive.It is looking to finally catch up with the United States and Russia after years of belatedly matching their milestones.Besides a space station, China is planning to build a base on the Moon, reiterating this week its goal to land humans on the Moon by 2030.The lunar plans were dealt a setback in 2017 when the powerful Long March-5 Y2 rocket failed to launch on a mission to put communication satellites into orbit.That forced the postponement of the Chang'e-5 launch, originally scheduled to collect Moon samples in the second half of 2017.Another robot, the Chang'e-4, landed on the far side of the Moon in January 2019\u2014a historic first.                China has been carrying out experiments in a lab simulating a lunar-like environment in preparation for its long-term goal of putting humans on the moon.             Chang'e-5 eventually landed on the Moon in 2020, raising a Chinese flag on the lunar surface and returning to Earth the first lunar samples in four decades.And in 2021, its Tianwen-1 mission successfully landed a rover on the surface of Mars.      Palace in the skyThe final module of space station Tiangong\u2014which means \"heavenly palace\"\u2014successfully docked with the core structure last year.It carries several pieces of cutting-edge science equipment, state news agency Xinhua reported, including \"the world's first space-based cold atomic clock system\".Tiangong is expected to remain in low Earth orbit at an altitude between 400 and 450 kilometers (250 and 280 miles) for at least 10 years\u2014realizing China's ambition to maintain a long-term human presence in space.It will be constantly crewed by rotating teams of three astronauts, who will conduct scientific experiments and help test new technologies.After Tuesday's launch, the next mission to Tiangong, the Shenzhou-17, is expected in October.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:China's 'space dream': A Long March to the Moon and beyond (2023, May 30)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-china-space-moon.html  This document is subject to copyright.

The Shenzhou 16 spacecraft lifted off from the Jiuquan launch center on the edge of the Gobi Desert in northwestern China atop a Long March 2-F rocket just after 9:30 a.m. (0130 GMT) Tuesday.The crew, including China's first civilian astronaut, will overlap briefly with three now aboard the Tiangong station, who will then return to Earth after completing their six-month mission.A third module was added to the station in November, and space program officials on Monday said they have plans to expand it, along with launching a crewed mission to the moon before 2030.China built its own space station after it was excluded from the International Space Station, largely due to U.S. concerns over the Chinese space programs' intimate ties with the People's Liberation Army, the military branch of the ruling Communist Party.China's first manned space mission in 2003 made it the third country after the former Soviet Union and the U.S. to put a person into space under its own resources.On the this latest mission, payload expert Gui Haichao, a professor at Beijing's top aerospace research institute, will join mission commander Maj.

Credit: AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein                 The crew will stay aboard the station for around five months, during which they will conduct scientific experiments and regular maintenance.The mission comes against the background of a rivalry with the U.S. for reaching new milestones in space. That has been largely friendly, but also reflects their sharpening competition for leadership and influence in the technology, military and diplomatic fields.American spending, supply chains and capabilities are believed to give it a significant edge over China, at least for now. China has broken out in some areas, however, bringing samples back from the lunar surface for the first time in decades and landing a rover on the less explored far side of the moon.The U.S., meanwhile, aims to put astronauts back on the lunar surface by the end of 2025 as part of a renewed commitment to crewed missions, aided by private sector players such as SpaceX and Blue Origin.In addition to their lunar programs, the two countries have also separately landed rovers on Mars, and China plans to follow the U.S. in landing a spacecraft on an asteroid.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

  "text": "Our familiar, warm, yellow sun is a relative rarity in the Milky Way. By far the most common stars are considerably smaller and cooler, sporting just half the mass of our sun at most. Billions of planets orbit these common dwarf stars in our galaxy.          To capture enough warmth to be habitable, these planets would need to huddle very close to their small stars, which leaves them susceptible to extreme tidal forces.In a new analysis based on the latest telescope data, University of Florida astronomers have discovered that two-thirds of the planets around these ubiquitous small stars could be roasted by these tidal extremes, sterilizing them. But that leaves one-third of the planets\u2014hundreds of millions across the galaxy\u2014that could be in a goldilocks orbit close enough, and gentle enough, to hold onto liquid water and possibly harbor life.UF astronomy professor Sarah Ballard and doctoral student Sheila Sagear published their findings the week of May 29 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Ballard and Sagear have long studied exoplanets, those worlds that orbit stars other than the sun.\"I think this result is really important for the next decade of exoplanet research, because eyes are shifting toward this population of stars,\" Sagear said. \"These stars are excellent targets to look for small planets in an orbit where it's conceivable that water might be liquid and therefore the planet might be habitable.\"Sagear and Ballard measured the eccentricity of a sample of more than 150 planets around these M dwarf stars, which are about the size of Jupiter. The more oval shaped an orbit, the more eccentric it is. If a planet orbits close enough to its star, at about the distance that Mercury orbits the sun, an eccentric orbit can subject it to a process known as tidal heating. As the planet is stretched and deformed by changing gravitational forces on its irregular orbit, friction heats it up. At the extreme end, this could bake the planet, removing all chance for liquid water.\"It's only for these small stars that the zone of habitability is close enough for these tidal forces to be relevant,\" Ballard said.Data came from NASA's Kepler telescope, which captures information about exoplanets as they move in front of their host stars. To measure the planets' orbits, Ballard and Sagear focused especially on how long the planets took to move across the face of the stars. Their study also relied on new data from the Gaia telescope, which measured the distance to billions of stars in the galaxy.\"The distance is really the key piece of information we were missing before that allows us to do this analysis now,\" Sagear said.Sagear and Ballard found that stars with multiple planets were the most likely to have the kind of circular orbits that allow them to retain liquid water. Stars with only one planet were the most likely to see tidal extremes that would sterilize the surface.Since one-third of the planets in this small sample had gentle enough orbits to potentially host liquid water, that likely means that the Milky Way has hundreds of millions of promising targets to probe for signs of life outside our solar system.

  "text": "The United Arab Emirates unveiled plans Monday to send a spaceship to explore the solar system's main asteroid belt, the latest space project by the oil-rich nation after it launched the successful Hope spacecraft to Mars in 2020.          Dubbed the Emirates Mission to the Asteroid Belt, the project aims to develop a spacecraft in the coming years and then launch it in 2028 to study various asteroids.\"This mission is a follow up and a follow on the Mars mission, where it was the first mission to Mars from the region,\" said Mohsen Al Awadhi, program director of the Emirates Mission to the Asteroid Belt. \"We're creating the same thing with this mission. That is, the first mission ever to explore these seven asteroids in specific and the first of its kind when it's looked at from the grand tour aspect.\"The UAE became the first Arab country and the second country ever to successfully enter Mars' orbit on its first try when its Hope probe reached the red planet in February 2021. The craft's goals include providing the first complete picture of the Martian atmosphere and its layers and helping answer key questions about the planet's climate and composition.If successful, the newly announced spacecraft will soar at speeds reaching 33,000 kilometers (20,500 miles) per hour on a seven-year journey to explore six asteroids. It will culminate in the deployment of a landing craft onto a seventh, rare \"red\" asteroid that scientists say may hold insight into the building blocks of life on Earth.Organic compounds like water are crucial constituents of life and have been found on some asteroids, potentially delivered through collisions with other organic-rich bodies or via the creation of complex organic molecules in space. Investigating the origins of these compounds, along with the possible presence of water on red asteroids, could shed light on the origin of Earth's water, thereby offering valuable insights into the genesis of life on our planet.                This computer graphic rendering made available by UAE Space Agency, Monday, May 29, 2023, shows the MBR Explorer, named after Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, the spacecraft that will be completing the Emirates Mission to the Asteroid belt. The United Arab Emirates Space Agency unveiled plans Monday to build and send a spacecraft on an exploration of the main asteroid belt.

Credit: UAE Space Agency via AP             The endeavor is a significant milestone for the burgeoning UAE Space Agency, established in 2014, as it follows up on its success in sending the Amal, or \"Hope,\" probe to Mars. The new journey would span a distance over ten times greater than the Mars mission.The explorer is named MBR after Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who also serves as the vice president and prime minister of the hereditarily ruled UAE. It will first make its way toward Venus, where the planet's gravitational pull will slingshot it back past the Earth and then Mars.      The craft will eventually reach the asteroid belt, flying as close as 150 kilometers (93 miles) to the celestial boulders and covering a total distance of 5 billion kilometers (around 3 billion miles).In October 2034, the craft is expected to make its final thrust to the seventh and last asteroid, named Justitia, before deploying a lander over a year later. Justitia, believed to be one of only two known red asteroids, is thought to potentially have a surface laden with organic substances.\"It's one of the two reddest objects in the asteroid belt, and scientists don't really understand why it's so red,\" said Hoor AlMaazmi, a space science researcher at the UAE space agency. \"There are theories about it being originally from the Kuiper Belt and where there's much more red objects there. So that's one thing that we can study because it has the potential for it to be water rich as well.\"The MBR Explorer will deploy a landing craft to study the surface of Justitia that will be fully developed by private UAE start-up companies. It may lay the groundwork for possible future resource extraction from asteroids to eventually support extended human missions in space\u2014and maybe even the UAE's ambitious goal of building a colony on Mars by 2117.\"We have identified different key areas that we want startups in the private sector to be part of, and we will engage with them through that,\" said Al Awadhi. \"We understand that the knowledge we have in the UAE is you know still being built. We will provide these startups with the knowledge they need.\"    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

  "text": "Asteroid mining is slowly but surely coming closer to reality. Many start-ups and governmental agencies alike are getting in on the action. But plenty of tools that would help get this burgeoning industry off the ground are still unavailable. One that would be particularly useful is a list of potential candidate asteroids to visit. While the information has been available in various places, no one has yet combined it into a single, searchable database until now.          The Exploitation des Ressources des Corps Celestes (ECOCEL) database is an effort by a French team led by Irina Kovalenko of ISAE-SUPAERO, France's premier aerospace engineering school. It captures combines two of the most aspects of asteroids that might be interesting to mining companies\u2014how easy it is to get to them and what they are made of.Determining how easy an asteroid is to reach is relatively simple and has been done in multiple places before. In fact, the ECOCEL team used data directly from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Small-Body Database. This publicly available database tracks almost 25,000 Near Earth Objects, the asteroids most likely to be visited by a first asteroid mining mission.To calculate how to reach the object, the Small-Body Database calculates the \"delta-V,\" or change in velocity necessary to get to the asteroid. Think of delta-v as the amount of energy required to reach an object, which is very important in the economic calculations of asteroid miners. The database tool itself has a specially designed interface that can select an asteroid based on minimizing the delta-v for a particular launch window.ECOCEL incorporates that information into its own calculation but adds another layer that might be even more important\u2014composition. Unfortunately, only 326 of the asteroids in the Small-Body Database have been spectrally characterized, which were reported in some previous papers. Therefore, ECOCEL, which relies on spectral data to determine an asteroid's composition, is limited to that number.Once a body's spectral classification has been defined, the database links data from the composition of meteorite samples to the spectroscopy of similarly composed asteroids, leading to a general understanding of the external composition of the asteroid. Unfortunately, the internal composition is harder to estimate. It isn't accurately tracked in the current iteration of the database, though orbital mechanics can theoretically estimate an object's density and, therefore, its internal composition.      With basic flight and composition data at hand, ECOCEL takes it one step further by utilizing a tool called Sun Earth Moon dynamics Python package. This software library uses orbital mechanics data for calculating where a given object in the system will be, and the ECOCEL team takes advantage of that to provide calculations for both one-way and round-trip flights. It also provides a potential launch window between 2020 and 2050, farther than most comparable databases.Some additional features include the ability to calculate a parking orbit and set delta-v limits. Overall, the database is must more tailored to the needs of both commercial and governmental asteroid mining projects than any that has previously been developed. Related research is also published in the journal Planetary and Space Science.Unfortunately, as of the time of writing, the database at ecocell-database.com does not appear to be online. It's unclear when it will come back, as it had previously been used in other studies, and a paper and presentation detailing its development were released in March. Hopefully, this potentially helpful internet-based tool will be able to make a comeback and prove useful to those engineers and entrepreneurs interested in making a go at creating the next great mining industry.

  "answer_race": " To introduce the final deployments of Juice.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the instrument that will provide images of Jupiter's atmosphere?",
  "answer_squad": " JANUS",
  "text": "Flight controllers at ESA's mission control center in Germany have been busy this week, working with instrument teams on the final deployments to prepare ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) for exploring Jupiter.          It has been six weeks since Juice began its journey, and in that time the Flight Control Team have deployed all the solar panels, antennas, probes and booms that were tucked away safely during launch. The last step has been the swinging out and locking into place of the probes and antennas that make up Juice's Radio & Plasma Wave Investigation (RPWI).\"It's been an exhausting but very exciting six weeks,\" says Angela Dietz, deputy spacecraft operations manager for the mission. \"We have faced and overcome various challenges to get Juice into the right shape for getting the best science out of its trip to Jupiter.\"We've had regular snapshots of the entire deployment process thanks to Juice's two onboard monitoring cameras, each with a different field of view. In the hours after launch, these cameras took Juice's first 'selfies' from space, and ever since, they have been vital for checking that all parts of the spacecraft deployed correctly.Juice's antennas and booms each carry part or all of some of Juice's 10 instruments. By placing them far from Juice, the instruments that need to be separated from the spacecraft's own electric and magnetic fields are kept at a distance.This powerful instrument package will collect data that helps us answer questions like: What are Jupiter's ocean worlds like? Why is Ganymede so unique? Could there be\u2014or ever have been\u2014life in the Jupiter system? How has Jupiter's complex environment shaped its moons, and vice versa? What is a typical gas giant planet like\u2014how did it form, and how does it work?Accompanying our views from the monitoring cameras, confirmation that everything deployed as planned also came from the instruments themselves. The teams behind some of the instruments have been switching them on and making measurements to check that everything is working well. Teams have already confirmed that Juice's RPWI, JANUS, J-MAG and GALA instruments, as well as the RADEM radiation monitor, are ready for Jupiter.RPWI: Five days, seven deploymentsThis week, the four Langmuir Probes and three Radio Wave Instrument antennas of the Radio & Plasma Wave Investigation (RPWI) were successfully deployed. Altogether these make up seven of the 10 RPWI sensors that will measure the variations in the electric and magnetic fields around Jupiter, as well as radio waves and cold plasma.After seeing the last boom deploy successfully this afternoon, principal investigator of RPWI, Jan-Erik Wahlund from the Swedish Institute of Space Physics said, \"Fantastic, after more than 10 years of intensive work, we are finally ready for science discoveries!\"RPWI will be the first ever device to generate a 3D map of the electric fields around Jupiter. It will give us valuable information on how energy is transferred between Jupiter's enormous rotating magnetosphere and the large icy moons Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. This energy transfer drives, for example, the auroras on Ganymede and in Jupiter's upper atmosphere. The special sensitivity of RPWI to low frequencies means that it will be able to detect very weak electromagnetic signals from tides and currents within the sub-surface oceans of the icy moons.Before and after each deployment, the RPWI team switched on the instrument to measure the difference made by each newly deployed sensor. Each one now collects data and delivers it to RPWI's onboard data processing unit, which sends the data down to Earth.\"Our 3D design strategy makes it possible to measure true physical observables, such as energy and momentum, without resorting to theories or simulations to interpret the data,\" says Jan Bergman, a researcher at the Swedish Institute of Space Physics and technical manager for RPWI.For more details on RPWI deployments, see the Swedish National Space Agency website (scroll down for English).                ESA\u2019s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, Juice, has two monitoring cameras (Juice Monitoring Cameras, JMC) to provide snapshots with different fields of view.\u00a0\u00a0 The images are provided in 1024 x 1024 pixel resolution and can be processed in colour. Their purpose is to monitor the spacecraft\u2019s various booms and antennas, especially during the challenging deployment period following launch. A scientific camera will provide high-resolution imagery during the cruise phase flybys of Earth, Moon and Venus, and of Jupiter and its icy moons once in the Jupiter system in 2031. The approximate locations of the two cameras are indicated on the central spacecraft diagram, pointing in the viewing direction. The insets show an indication of what can be expected in the images, and are representative of the situation after the booms have been fully deployed. Key features correlating to the various instrument booms are labeled in each of the insets (see key for details). The +X +Y +Z graphic represents the different faces of the spacecraft as may be referred to in image captions. For orientation, the high-gain antenna is on the -X side, the solar arrays rotate around the +/- Y axis, and the spacecraft was originally attached to the launcher on the -Z side. The direction of travel can change between +/- Z depending on the spacecraft orientation. The final published images may appear in a different orientation to the sketches shown here, with additional features visible in the images. The first images taken just minutes after launch also featured Earth in the background.

Unlike the RPWI sensors mounted on booms far from Juice's main body, JANUS is fixed to an optical bench; this means that it is kept stable when pointing towards its targets\u2014like using a tripod here on Earth. JANUS also points in the same direction as Juice's other \"remote sensing\" instruments.At Jupiter, the JANUS camera will take images in 13 different colors, from violet light to near infrared. These images will allow scientists to investigate the moons Ganymede, Callisto and Europa, including studying whether life could exist below their icy crusts. JANUS will also collect data on other parts of the Jovian system, including the intense volcanic activity on Io, the many smaller moons, and Jupiter's faint ring system. Last but not least, JANUS will image processes taking place in Jupiter's atmosphere.During last week's commissioning, a full hardware check was undertaken, with all subsystems activated and monitored. The performance of the instrument was checked by taking images of stars.\"The acquired data demonstrate that everything was nominal. After this intense on-ground session, we can say, we have a (fully commissioned) instrument!\" says Pasquale Palumbo (IAPS-INAF), principal investigator of JANUS.For more details see the website of the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics.RIME: A sticky situation, finally unstuckThe journey to full deployment has not been entirely smooth sailing. Just a few days after launch, flight controllers attempted to unfurl the Radar for Icy Moon Exploration (RIME) instrument antenna. The first segments of the antennas unfolded as planned, but the next segments refused to budge.Controllers suspected that a tiny stuck pin jammed the segments in place. They put their heads together to figure out a solution. They shook Juice using its thrusters. They warmed Juice using sunlight. Every day the antenna showed signs of movement, but stayed stuck in its bracket. Finally, RIME was jolted into life almost three weeks later, when the team fired a mechanical device inside the bracket. The shock moved the pin by a matter of millimeters. To the relief of ESA operations and project teams as well as industry, the antenna fully unfolded.Commissioning of RIME is still ongoing, but the team has already made some measurements with the instrument.What's next for Juice?In the next weeks, more of Juice's 10 instruments will be switched on and checked, with the hope that by mid-July, all instruments will be working perfectly, ready for cruising to Jupiter.In August 2024, Juice will carry out the world's first ever lunar-Earth gravity assist. By performing this maneuver\u2014a gravity assist flyby of the Moon followed just 1.5 days later by one of Earth\u2014Juice will be able to save a significant amount of propellant on its journey.

  "text": "After a week of stormy weather delays, SpaceX waited just a bit longer but managed an early Saturday liftoff of a satellite to knock out the Space Coast's 26th launch of the year.          A Falcon 9 carrying the Arabsat BADR-8 telecommunications satellite headed for geosynchronous orbit let the winds die down from the opening of the launch window late Friday, but managed to blast off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station's Space Launch Complex 40 at 12:30 a.m. a little over an hour later.It was the fourth night launch for SpaceX this month with three previous successful Starlink missions from Cape Canaveral lighting up the sky in the wee hours.The first-stage booster made its 14th flight with a recovery on SpaceX's droneship Just Read the Instructions down range in the Atlantic Ocean. It was the 195th time the company has recovered a booster from its rockets.This was the second launch SpaceX has done for Arabsat following what was the first Falcon Heavy launch with a customer in 2019. SpaceX has a third launch contracted for what will be the first of Arabsat's seventh-generation satellites. The company primarily provides communications for the Middle East and North Africa, but has expanded into Europe and Central Asia.SpaceX's busy year includes now 25 of the 26 launches from the Space Coast so far with the only other one coming from Relativity Space and its 3D-printed Terran 1 rocket. It was its fifth in May from the Space Coast, while its busiest month was in March with seven liftoffs.The combined launches from Canaveral and KSC saw a record 57 orbital rockets from all companies fly in 2022 with SLD 45 commander Maj. Gen. Stephen Purdy reporting earlier this year the Space Coast could see up to 92 launches in 2023.The Arabsat launch became SpaceX's 20th from Cape Canaveral this year with another six flown from Kennedy Space Center including the recent crewed launch of the Axiom Space Ax-2 mission to the International Space Station, which has a planned return to splash down off the coast of Florida next week with undocking slated for Tuesday morning.The company has also flown 10 times from California's Vandenberg Space Force Base for a combined 35 during a year that company CEO Elon Musk said might see as many as 100 across all of its launch complexes. It also attempted a suborbital flight of its in-development Starship and Super Heavy this year, but that ended with the rocket self-destructing before reaching space.      The company still has several high-profile launches with its active stable of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets this year including three more possible crewed launches from KSC. That includes the private Polaris Dawn mission commanded by billionaire Jared Isaacman, who flew to space on the Inspiration4 mission.Now targeting this summer, Polaris Dawn will be an orbital mission that aims to perform the first private tethered spacewalk. Slated for mid-August is the next replacement crew for the International Space Station on Crew-7, and a third Axiom Space mission to the ISS could fly as early as November.SpaceX has at least three more Falcon Heavy missions on tap this year as well including its third Space Force mission USSF-52 targeting this summer and the launch of the delayed NASA Psyche probe in October.NASA won't be back in the launch business with its Space Launch System rocket for the Artemis II mission until late 2024, and the only other regular launch provider from the Space Coast\u2014United Launch Alliance\u2014has yet to fly in 2023, but it has several missions expected to fly this year after a series of delays.That includes the second-to-last mission for its Delta IV Heavy on the NROL-68 mission for the U.S. Space Force's Space Systems Command and the National Reconnaissance Office delayed from April now targeting June 21; an Atlas V launch on the first crewed flight of the Boeing CST-100 Starliner to the ISS as early as July 21 also delayed from April; and the first-ever flight of its new rocket Vulcan Centaur with the Astrobotic Peregrine lunar lander on the Certification-1 mission delayed from May, but without a target launch date beyond June or July, according to ULA CEO and President Tory Bruno.    \u00a92023 Orlando Sentinel.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "answer_race": " Black hole jets' X-ray emissions vary unexpectedly",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the highest resolution X-ray observatory?",
  "answer_squad": " Chandra X-ray Observatory",
  "text": "Researchers discovered only relatively recently that black hole jets emit X-rays, and how the jets accelerate particles to this high-energy state is still a mystery. Surprising new findings in Nature Astronomy appear to rule out one leading theory, opening the door to reimagining how particle acceleration works in the jets\u2014and possibly also elsewhere in the universe.          One leading model of how jets generate X-rays expects the jets' X-ray emissions to remain stable over long time scales (millions of years). However, the new paper found that the X-ray emissions of a statistically significant number of jets varied over just a few years.\"One of the reasons we're excited about the variability is that there are two main models for how X-rays are produced in these jets, and they're completely different,\" explains lead author Eileen Meyer, an astronomer at University of Maryland, Baltimore County. \"One model invokes very low-energy electrons and one has very high-energy electrons. And one of those models is completely incompatible with any kind of variability.\"For the study, the authors analyzed archival data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the highest-resolution X-ray observatory available. The research team looked at nearly all of the black hole jets for which Chandra had multiple observations, which amounted to 155 unique regions within 53 jets.Discovering relatively frequent variability on such short time scales \"is revolutionary in the context of these jets, because that was not expected at all,\" Meyer says.Rethinking particle accelerationIn addition to assuming stability in X-ray emissions over time, the simplest theory for how jets generate X-rays assumes particle acceleration occurs at the center of the galaxy in the black hole \"engine\" that drives the jet. However, the new study found rapid changes in X-ray emissions all along the length of the jets. That suggests particle acceleration is occurring all along the jet, at vast distances from the jet's origin at the black hole.\"There are theories out there for how this could work, but a lot of what we've been working with is now clearly incompatible with our observations,\" Meyer says.Interestingly, the results also hinted that jets closer to Earth had more variability than those much farther away. The latter are so far away, that by the time the light coming from them reaches the telescope, it is like looking back in time. It makes sense to Meyer that older jets would have less variability. Earlier in the universe's history, the universe was smaller and ambient radiation was greater, which researchers believe could lead to greater stability of X-rays in the jets.Critical collaborationDespite Chandra's outstanding imaging resolution, the data set posed significant challenges. Chandra observed some of the pockets of variability with only a handful of X-ray photons. And the variability in X-ray production in a given jet was typically tens of percent or so. To avoid unintentionally counting randomness as real variability, Meyer collaborated with statisticians at the University of Toronto and the Imperial College of London.\"Pulling this result out of the data was almost like a miracle, because the observations were not designed to detect it,\" Meyer says. The team's analysis suggests that between 30 and 100 percent of the jets in the study showed variability over short time scales. \"While we would like better constraints,\" she says, \"the variability is notably not zero.\"The new findings poke significant holes in one of the major theories for X-ray production in black hole jets, and Meyer hopes the paper spurs future work. \"Hopefully this will be a real call to the theorists,\" she says, \"to basically take a look at this result and come up with jet models that are consistent with what we're finding.\" More information:Eileen Meyer, Variability of extragalactic X-ray jets on kiloparsec scales, Nature Astronomy (2023).

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the cloud that has a large magnetic field?",
  "answer_squad": " Lynds 43",
  "text": "Using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), an international team of astronomers has observed a nearby molecular cloud designated Lynds 43. Results of the observations, published May 18 on the arXiv pre-print server, provide more hints into the complex magnetic field of this cloud.          Lynds 43, or L43 for short, is a dense and complex molecular cloud in the northern part of the Ophiuchus star-forming region, at a distance of about 400 light years. The cloud contains a bright starless core embedded within a longer more diffuse filament, a T-Tauri star (designated RNO 90) and a young Class I protostar (RNO 91). Previous studies of L43 have found that it has a large-scale magnetic field roughly parallel to the filament, although curving slightly to the south.A group of astronomers led by Janik Karoly of the University of Central Lancashire, U.K., has performed polarization observations of dust emission from L43 as part of the B-fields In STar Forming Regions Observations (BISTRO) large survey program. For this purpose, they employed JCMT's Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array 2 (SCUBA2)/POL-2.\"We presented polarization measurements of the infrared dark molecular cloud L43 at 850 \u00b5m made using JCMT/POL-2 as part of the JCMT BISTRO Survey,\" the researchers wrote in the paper.The observations of L43 found molecular hydrogen (H2) column densities typical for dense starless cores, and a power law index of about -0.85. Therefore, the results suggest a possible decrease, but not complete loss, in grain alignment efficiency, deep within the molecular cloud.Furthermore, the study identified a complicated and multiple-component magnetic field of L43, which was divided into three regions. One region is slightly offset from the dense submillimeter-bright core (Region 2), another region in the more diffuse region to the east (Region 1) and the remaining region which spatially coincides in the plane of the sky with the carbon monoxide outflow driven by RNO 91.The observations also found an alignment between the magnetic field and the outflow cavity walls which is distinctly different from the magnetic field in the rest of the cloud. Based on the collected data, the magnetic field strengths in Region 1 and Region 2 were calculated to be about 40\u201390 \u00b5G and 70\u2013160 \u00b5G, respectively. The magnetic field strength in the outflow region is estimated to be between 120 and 260 \u00b5G.The authors of the paper added that there appears to be an evolutionary gradient along the isolated filament that L43 is embedded within.

Testing technologies for Mars exploration is part of the daily job of Laura Bielenberg, an ESA graduate trainee for the Mars Sample Return campaign.The test takes place at the rock-strewn recreation of the Red Planet at ESA's ESTEC technical center in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. The nickname of this test site is the 'Mars Yard' and is part of the Planetary Robotics Laboratory.The tube is a replica of the sample caches that NASA's Perseverance rover is leaving on Mars hermetically sealed with precious martian samples inside. They are called RSTA, an acronym of Returnable Sample Tube Assembly, and to most people on Earth they look like lightsabers.Laura is investigating sample tube collection strategies, from autonomous detection to pose estimation of sample tubes on Mars, with a testbed called the RABBIT (RAS Bread Boarding In-house Testbed).Credit: ESA/NASA/JPL-Caltech/GSFC/MSFCThe Sample Transfer Arm will need to load the tubes from the martian surface for delivery towards Earth. ESA's robotic arm will collect them from the Perseverance rover, and possibly others dropped by sample recovery helicopters as a backup.Besides cameras and sensors, the team relies on neural networks to detect the tubes and estimate their pose. Inspired by the way the human brain works, neural networks mimic the way biological neurons signal to one another.

  "text": "China's burgeoning space program plans to place astronauts on the moon before 2030 and expand the country's orbiting space station, officials said Monday.          Monday's announcement comes amid against the background of a rivalry with the U.S. for reaching new milestones in outer space, reflecting their competition for influence on global events.That has conjured up memories of the space race between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s, although American spending, supply chains and capabilities are believed to give it a significant edge over China, at least for the present.The U.S. aims to put astronauts back on the lunar surface by the end of 2025 as part of a renewed commitment to crewed missions, aided by private sector players such as SpaceX and Blue Origin.The deputy director of China's space agency confirmed the twin objectives at a news conference but gave no specific dates.The agency also introduced three astronauts who will head to the country's space station in a launch scheduled for Tuesday morning. They'll replace a crew that's been on the orbiting station for six months. China is first preparing for a \"short stay on the lunar surface and human-robotic joint exploration,\" Deputy Director of the Chinese Manned Space Agency Lin Xiqiang told reporters at the rare briefing by the military-run program.                Chinese astronauts for the upcoming Shenzhou-16 mission from left, Gui Haichao, Jing Haipeng and Zhu Yangzhu behind glass meet the reporters at a press conference at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center ahead of the launch mission from Jiuquan in northwestern China, Monday, May 29, 2023.

Credit: AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein             \"We have a complete near-Earth human space station and human round-trip transportation system,\" complemented by a process for selecting, training and supporting new astronauts, he said. A schedule of two crewed missions a year is \"sufficient for carrying out our objectives,\" Lin said.The Tiangong space station was said to have been finished in November when the third section was added.A fourth module will be launched \"at an appropriate time to advance support for scientific experiments and provide the crew with improved working and living conditions,\" Lin said.The trio being launched aboard the Shenzhou 16 craft will overlap briefly with the three astronauts who have lived on the station for the previous six months conducting experiments and assembling equipment inside and outside the vehicle.

All previous crew members have been in the People's Liberation Army, the military wing of the country's ruling Communist Party.      Gui Haichao, a professor at Beijing's top aerospace research institute, will join mission commander Jing Haipeng and spacecraft engineer Zhu Yangzhu as the payload expert.Speaking to media at the launch site outside the northwestern city of Jiuquan, Jing said the mission marked \"a new stage of application and development,\" in China's space program.\"We firmly believe that the spring of China's space science has arrived, and we have the determination, confidence, and ability to resolutely complete the mission,\" said Jing, a major general who has made three previous space flights.China's first manned space mission in 2003 made it the third country after the USSR and the U.S. to put a person into space.

Credit: AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein             China built its own space station after it was excluded from the International Space Station, largely due to U.S. objections over the Chinese space programs' intimate ties to the PLA.Space is increasingly seen as a new area of competition between China and the United States\u2014the world's two largest economies and rivals for diplomatic and military influence\u2014one a highly centralized, one party state, the other a democracy where the partisan divide largely evaporates over the issues of relations with China and space exploration.The astronauts NASA sends to the moon by the end of 2025 will aim for the south pole where permanently shadowed craters are believed to be packed with frozen water.Plans for permanent crewed bases on the moon are also being considered by both countries, raising questions about rights and interests on the lunar surface. U.S. law tightly restricts cooperation between the two countries' space programs and while China says it welcomes foreign collaborations, those have thus far been limited to scientific research.

I very much regret that personally,\" he said.In addition to their lunar programs, the U.S. and China have also landed rovers on Mars and Beijing plans to follow the U.S. in landing a spacecraft on an asteroid.Other countries and organizations ranging from the India and the United Arab Emirates to Israel and the European Union are also planning lunar missions.

  "text": "Living on Mars wasn't exactly a childhood dream for Canadian biologist Kelly Haston, though she'll soon spend a year preparing for just that.          \"We are just going to pretend that we're there,\" the 52-year-old told AFP, summing up her participation in an exercise simulating a long stay on the Red Planet.At the end of June, she will be one of the four volunteers stepping into a Martian habitat in Houston, Texas that will be their home for the next 12 months.\"It still sometimes seems a bit unreal to me,\" she laughs.For NASA, which has carefully selected the participants, these long-term experiments make it possible to evaluate the behavior of a crew in an isolated and confined environment, ahead of a real mission in future.Participants will face equipment failures and water limitations, the space agency has warned\u2014as well as some \"surprises,\" according to Haston.Their communications with the outside world will suffer from the delays that exist between Earth and Mars\u2014up to 20 minutes one-way, depending on the planets' positions\u2014and 40 minutes two ways.\"I'm very excited about this, but I'm also realistic for what the challenge is,\" says the research scientist, whose status as a permanent resident of the United States made her eligible for the program.The habitat, dubbed Mars Dune Alpha, is a 3D printed 1,700 square-foot (160 square-meter) facility, complete with bedrooms, a gym, common areas, and a vertical farm to grow food.\"It's actually surprisingly spacious feeling when you go inside it,\" said Haston, who visited last year before her participation was confirmed.\"And we do have an outdoor area as well where we will mimic spacewalks or Mars walks.\"                Kelly Haston, a research scientist who will spend a year in Mars Dune Alpha, a habitat that simulates life on the Red Planet.             This area, which is separated by an airlock, is filled with red sand, though it is still covered rather than being open air.The crew will have to don their suits to do \"spacewalks\"\u2014\"probably one of the things that I'm looking forward to the most,\" says Haston, a registered member of the Mohawk Nation.'Close knit'Haston wasted no time in filling out her application when her partner told her about the opportunity.\"It's aligned with many of my goals in life to explore different avenues of research and science, and then also to be a test subject, and to give to a study that will hopefully further space exploration.\"The four members of the mission\u2014herself, an engineer, an emergency doctor and a nurse\u2014did not know each other before the selection process, but have since met.\"We really are close-knit already,\" says Haston, who has been named commander of the group, adding she looks forward to seeing these relationships grow even stronger.They might be simulating an important exploratory mission for humanity, but how the housemates get along as they share mundane chores including cleaning and meal preparation will be crucial.A month of training is planned in Houston before entering the habitat.A teammate could leave in case of injury or medical emergency.But a whole series of procedures have been drawn up for situations that can be handled by the crew themselves\u2014including on how to tell them about a family problem that has arisen outside.                The workroom in Mars Dune Alpha at the Johnson Space center.             IsolationWhat worries the Canadian most is how she will manage being away from family. She'll only be able to keep in regular touch through email, and only rarely via videos, but never live.She'll miss being outside and getting to see mountains and the sea, she says.To cope, she plans to draw on her past experiences, such as a research expedition in Africa where she studied the genetic characteristics of frogs around Lake Victoria.She spent several months sleeping in cars and tents, with four people, without reliable cell phone coverage.Feelings of isolation \"are things that I think feel very familiar to me.\"A specialist in the field of developing stem cell treatments for certain diseases, she has worked in recent years for start ups in California, where she also studied.This mission is the first of a series of three planned by NASA, grouped under the title CHAPEA (Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog).A year-long mission simulating life on Mars took place in 2015-2016 in a habitat in Hawaii, but although NASA participated in it, it was not at the helm.Under its Artemis program, America plans to send humans back to the Moon in order to learn how to live there long-term to help prepare a trip to Mars, sometime towards the end of the 2030s.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Meet the scientist (sort of) spending a year on Mars (2023, May 27)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-scientist-year-mars.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "A private Japanese moon lander went into free-fall while trying to land on the lunar surface last month, company officials said Friday, blaming a software issue and a last-minute switch in the touchdown location.          The spacecraft belonging to the company ispace was originally supposed to land in a flat plain. But the target was changed to a crater before December's launch. The crater's steep sides apparently confused the onboard software, and the 7-foot (2-meter) spacecraft went into a free-fall from less than 3 miles (5 kilometers) up, slamming into the lunar surface.The estimated speed at impact was more than 300 feet (100 meters) per second, said the company's chief technology officer, Ryo Ujiie.NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter photographed the crash site the next day as it flew overhead, revealing a field of debris as well as lunar soil hurled aside by the impact.Computer simulations done in advance of the landing attempt did not incorporate the terrain of the new landing site, Ujiie said.CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada said the company is still on track to attempt another moon landing in 2024, and that all the lessons learned will be incorporated into the next try. A third landing attempt is planned for 2025.

Only three governments have achieved that: Russia, the United States and China. An Israeli nonprofit tried in 2019, but its attempt also ended in a crash landing.Named Hakuto, Japanese for white rabbit, the spacecraft and its experiments were insured, according to Hakamada. The United Arab Emirates had a mini lunar rover on board that was lost in the crash.Two U.S. companies have lunar landers awaiting launch later this year from Cape Canaveral, in partnership with NASA.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

  "text": "A planetary physicist at The University of Texas at Arlington is the lead author of a study that catalogs all known planet-hosting, triple-stellar systems\u2014those having three or more stars with planets.          Manfred Cuntz, professor of physics, led the project, titled \"An Early Catalog of Planet-hosting Multiple-star Systems of Order Three and Higher.\" This study provides a thorough bibliographic assessment of planet-hosting, triple-stellar systems.It was recently published in The Astrophysical Journal Supplements Series. Co-authors include UTA alumni G.E. Luke, Matthew Millard and Lindsey Boyle, as well as Shaan D. Patel, a doctoral-bound graduate student.The paper offers a system classification that considers the various types of planetary orbits among other factors. Additionally, the authors examine past controversies and planet retractions based on the criteria for what constitutes a planet-hosting, triple-stellar system.Most planets, such as all in Earth's solar system, orbit a single star. About 100 known planets are members of stellar binaries, the authors wrote in their study.\"The number of planets found to be hosted by higher-order systems is relatively small\u2014about 40 for triple and quadruple systems combined, with the exact number depending on whether some controversial or unconfirmed cases are included,\" Cuntz said. \"The number of confirmed planets in triple-stellar systems currently stands at about 30, which is approximately 0.5% of the total number of planets identified. This aspect makes those planets very special.\"The NASA Kepler Space Telescope, which was operational from 2009-18, aided in the science of discovering planet-hosting, triple-stellar systems, Cuntz said. Scientists expect the number of known systems to increase, particularly with the abilities of the James Webb Space Telescope, which was launched in 2021.The authors note that the overwhelming majority of triple-stellar system planets are Jupiter-type, meaning they are gas giants, and the host stars are relatively massive, compared to typical main-sequence stars. However, some Earth-mass planets have been found as well.Triple-stellar systems can be divided into two subgroups, each of which travels in a relatively large orbit around the system's center of mass. In a triple-stellar system, two of the stars usually form a close binary pair (two stars that are gravitationally bound to and in orbit around each other), and the third orbits that pair from a farther distance. Systems with more than three stars are expected to produce even more complicated orbiting arrangements.\"The existence of planets in triple-star systems is extremely challenging theoretically, both regarding their formation and orbital stability,\" Cuntz said. \"These topics are a stark motivation of future UTA research, also involving students.\" More information:M.

  "text": "Since 2004, China has been pioneering many aspects of lunar exploration with the Chang'e project, of which all five missions were successful in obtaining new information about the moon.          China has been leading the advancement of lunar research and understanding with their Chang'e project since 2004 with no signs of slowing down. The information obtained from Chang'e missions has given humans a much deeper understanding of the moon, including the composition of its surface material, the moon's history and evolution, and mastering the three phases of unmanned lunar exploration: orbiting, landing, and returning. Gaining a more thorough understanding of the moon and its components can help with establishing research facilities on the moon to uncover more answers about Earth's only satellite.A review article on China's lunar exploration was published in Science China Earth Sciences on April 28.With all five missions being a success, China has made a dent in what used to be \"unknown\" about the moon. The first Chang'e mission uncovered some basic knowledge of the moon's specifications to make unmanned travel doable: successful orbiting of the moon, landing, and returning is the first step in being able to get into the nitty-gritty of lunar exploration. With this first step being a success, Chang'e's second mission was underway. This mission obtained information about the composition of lunar materials and a 3D image of the moon's topography.\"Lunar surface in-situ detection can expand and improve the global-scale research results in terms of detection accuracy and research depth, which promote the high integration of global knowledge and local precise understanding, and realize the sublimation of scientific and rational understanding,\" said Prof. Li Chunlai, researcher and first author of the paper.Subsequent missions obtained information on the distribution and thickness of the surface layer's rocks, dust, and other materials (referred to as the \"regolith\" layer), the abundance and distribution of resources and elements, and the microwave properties of lunar soil.\"Lunar soil can record the radiation history of the Sun through its interaction with the solar wind, which provides a convenient way to study the exposure age of lunar material, the evolution of solar activity, and the influence of the sun on the Earth's climate change,\" Li said.Using microwave radiation, the surface of the moon is visualized, and a correlation between lunar brightness temperature and material distribution was observed; there is also a topographical effect that comes into play, but ultimately the novel use of remote sensing technology gave researchers a complete picture of the surface of the moon and some of its inner workings.The informational waves made by the Chang'e missions may spur other breakthroughs to lead to an exponentially increased understanding of the moon. Subjects that need more research include the elusive water ice found on the moon as well as the moon's inner material composition; further investigation into the evolutionary history of the moon is also an area where researchers are hoping to make a breakthrough. In Chang'e Mission 5, the lunar samples obtained opened new doors into exploring the early history of magmatism on the moon, as that information may likely explain the distribution and composition of the moon's surface.China aims to continue its research to further investigate the moon, with plans to develop a lunar research station where materials and other aspects of \"lunar living\" can be studied on-site. With all the successes China has had with lunar technology, the future goal is to better understand the resources available on the moon and how they can be utilized. With a true understanding of the moon's environment, history, and processes, the sky is the limit on what humanity may be able to achieve when it comes to space and lunar exploration.

  "answer_race": " introduce a new study",
  "question_squad": " What is the core structure of a solar eruption?",
  "answer_squad": " a magnetic rope",
  "text": "Recently, a research team led by Prof. Gou Yanyu from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) found that the solar outburst structure undergoes a complex reconfiguration evolution during the early outbursts. This is an important advancement in the study of solar outburst activity. This study was published in Nature Astronomy.          In classical images, the core structure of a solar eruption is a magnetic rope consisting of spirally wound magnetic lines. When the eruption begins, the magnetic ropes around the core are transformed by magnetic reconnection into spirally wound magnetic lines, which wrap around the original core, leading to its rapid growth in a \"snowball\" fashion. However, only about a third of the solar ejecta detected by various near-Earth and interplanetary spacecraft in situ possessed the expected magnetic structure, while the rest deviated significantly from classical images.By studying a coronal mass ejection event, the researchers revealed that the pre-emergence magnetic rope structure underwent a complex series of stripping, disintegration and reconstruction during the outburst. Observational evidence suggested that the pre-burst S-shaped magnetic rope structure developed from small-scale \"seeds.\"At the start of the outburst, the footpoints of the magnetic ropes are clearly outlined by a trapezoidal bright band in the lower atmosphere. During the subsequent violent outburst, the footpoints of the outburst structure are manifested as darkened regions in the corona due to the absence of material.With the highly dynamic changes in the solar chromospheric flare band and the consequent drift of the coronal darkening region, the footpoints of the eruptive structure shift dramatically, barely intersecting with the footpoints of the pre-eruptive magnetic rope. This is clearly in contrast with classical images, which predicted that the coronal darkening region characterizing the footpoints of the eruptive structure should have covered the footpoints of the original magnetic rope.The end of the flare zone shows a highly irregular pattern and a back-and-forth sawing motion, revealing a complex three-dimensional magnetic reconnection within the magnetic rope and between the magnetic rope and the surrounding field. These phenomena suggested that the three-dimensional magnetic field reconnection during the eruption replaces the magnetic flux of the original magnetic rope almost completely.This study reveals the details of the process of complex three-dimensional magnetic reconnection and its important role in the formation of coronal mass ejections. It provides a new physical explanation for the generation of complex ejection structures in interplanetary space, and sheds light on space weather forecasting.

  "text": "Virgin Galactic successfully carried out its first spaceflight in nearly two years Thursday, the company said, after an \"enhancement period\" to make safety upgrades to its fleet.          It was the fifth time the space tourism company brushed the boundary of space, and has been billed as the final test before commercial operations can begin in late June, with members of the Italian Air Force as the first paying customers.\"Touchdown, VSS Unity!\" the company tweeted, referring to the name of the company's spaceplane. \"Our crew and spaceship are back on Earth after landing smoothly at Spaceport America, New Mexico.\"The mission \"was a fantastic achievement for everyone at Virgin Galactic,\" added CEO Michael Colglazier, in a statement.The Unity 25 mission flew four of the company employees to an altitude of just over 54 miles (87 kilometers) above sea level.Virgin Galactic's space program has suffered years of delays and a 2014 accident in which a pilot died.Unlike other companies that use vertical-launch rockets, Virgin Galactic uses a carrier aircraft with two pilots that takes off from a runway, gains high altitude, and drops a rocket-powered plane that soars into space at nearly Mach 3, before gliding back to Earth.                Virgin Galatic's spaceflight total journey time is 90 minutes, with passengers experiencing a few minutes of weightlessness in the space plane's cabin.             The total journey time is 90 minutes, with passengers experiencing a few minutes of weightlessness in the space plane's cabin.Its first fully crewed flight in 2021 included the company's flamboyant founder, British billionaire Richard Branson.But what had appeared to be a breakthrough moment for the company was marred by an official safety probe after the spaceplane was found to have dropped below its assigned airspace on its descent.The Federal Aviation Agency later cleared the company to resume activity after it promised corrective actions.Virgin Galactic has sold 800 tickets for future commercial flights\u2014600 between 2005 and 2014 for $200,000 to $250,000, and 200 since then for $450,000 each.It competes in the \"suborbital\" space tourism sector with billionaire Jeff Bezos' company, Blue Origin, which has already sent 32 people into space.But since an accident in September 2022 during an unmanned flight, Blue Origin's rocket has been grounded.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the new method that allows scientists to look for subtle differences in the ringing of black holes?",
  "answer_squad": " Black Hole Spectroscopy by Mode Cleaning",
  "text": "Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity describes how the fabric of space and time, or spacetime, is curved in response to mass. Our sun, for example, warps space around us such that planet Earth rolls around the sun like a marble tossed into a funnel (Earth does not fall into the sun due to the Earth's sideways momentum).          The theory, which was revolutionary at the time it was proposed in 1915, recast gravity as a curving of spacetime. As fundamental as this theory is to the very nature of space around us, physicists say it might not be the end of the story. Instead, they argue that theories of quantum gravity, which attempt to unify general relativity with quantum physics, hold secrets to how our universe works at the deepest levels.One place to search for signatures of quantum gravity is in the mighty collisions between black holes, where gravity is at its most extreme. Black holes are the densest objects in the universe\u2014their gravity is so strong that they squeeze objects falling into them into spaghetti-like noodles. When two black holes collide and merge into one larger body, they roil space-time around them, sending ripples called gravitational waves outward in all directions.The National Science Foundation-funded LIGO, managed by Caltech and MIT, has been routinely detecting gravitational waves generated by black hole mergers since 2015 (its partner observatories, Virgo and KAGRA, joined the hunt in 2017 and 2020, respectively). So far, however, the general theory of relativity has passed test after test with no signs of breaking down.Now, two new Caltech-led papers, in Physical Review X and Physical Review Letters, describe new methods for putting general relativity to even more stringent tests. By looking more closely at the structures of black holes, and the ripples in space-time they produce, the scientists are seeking signs of small deviations from general relativity that would hint at the presence of quantum gravity.\"When two black holes merge to produce a bigger black hole, the final black hole rings like a bell,\" explains Yanbei Chen (Ph.D. '03), a professor of physics at Caltech and a co-author of both studies. \"The quality of the ringing, or its timbre, may be different from the predictions of general relativity if certain theories of quantum gravity are correct. Our methods are designed to look for differences in the quality of this ringdown phase, such as the harmonics and overtones, for example.\"      The first paper, co-led by Dongjun Li, a graduate student at Caltech, and Pratik Wagle, a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, reports a new single equation to describe how black holes would ring within the framework of certain quantum gravity theories, or in what scientists refer to as the beyond-general-relativity regime.                Dongjun Li and his collaborators' equation describes how black holes would ring in the beyond-general-relativity regime. Credit: California Institute of Technology             The work builds upon a ground-breaking equation developed 50 years ago by Saul Teukolsky (Ph.D. '73), the Robinson Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics at Caltech. Teukolsky had developed a complex equation to better understand how the ripples of space-time geometry propagate around black holes. In contrast to numerical relativity methods, in which supercomputers are required to simultaneously solve many differential equations pertaining to general relativity, the Teukolsky equation is much simpler to use and, as Li explains, provides direct physical insight into the problem.\"If one wants to solve all the Einstein equations of a black hole merger to accurately simulate it, they must turn to supercomputers,\" Li says. \"Numerical relativity methods are incredibly important for accurately simulating black hole mergers, and they provide a crucial foundation for interpreting LIGO data. But it is extremely hard for physicists to draw intuitions directly from the numerical results. The Teukolsky equation gives us an intuitive look at what is going on in the ringdown phase.\"Li was able to take Teukolsky's equation and adapt it for black holes in the beyond-general-relativity regime for the first time. \"Our new equation allows us to model and understand gravitational waves propagating around black holes that are more exotic than Einstein predicted,\" he says.The second paper, published in Physical Review Letters, led by Caltech graduate student Sizheng Ma, describes a new way to apply Li's equation to actual data acquired by LIGO and its partners in their next observational run. This data analysis approach uses a series of filters to remove features of a black hole's ringing predicted by general relativity, so that potentially subtle, beyond-general-relativity signatures can be revealed.\"We can look for features described by Dongjun's equation in the data that LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA will collect,\" Ma says. \"Dongjun has found a way to translate a large set of complex equations into just one equation, and this is tremendously helpful. This equation is more efficient and easier to use than methods we used before.\"The two studies complement each other well, Li says. \"I was initially worried that the signatures my equation predicts would be buried under the multiple overtones and harmonics; fortunately, Sizheng's filters can remove all these known features, which allows us to just focus on the differences,\" he says.Chen added: \"Working together, Li and Ma's findings can significantly boost our community's ability to probe gravity.\"The first study, titled \"Perturbations of spinning black holes beyond General Relativity: Modified Teukolsky equation,\" was funded by the Simons Foundation, the Brinson Foundation, and the National Science Foundation (NSF). Other authors include Nicol\u00e1s Yunes of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

  "text": "Researchers using a telescope owned and operated by CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, have detected a \"fast radio burst\" in a nearby galaxy that questions what we know about how the phenomena form.          New results published today in The Astrophysical Journal indicate the source of the interstellar blast is in a much calmer galactic environment than other known events.Marcin Glowacki from the Curtin University node of the International Center for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) led the latest research using CSIRO's ASKAP radio telescope on Wajarri Yamaji Country in Western Australia.Dr. Glowacki said while previous studies suggest colliding galaxies could create massive stars that may eventually cause fast radio bursts, this paper's findings challenge that idea.\"Of the radio bursts where we've studied their host galaxies in detail, we've seen colliding and merging galaxies. In this research, we aren't seeing those same clear signals of a turbulent galaxy,\" Dr. Glowacki said.\"What we've seen in this new paper is that the host galaxy itself appears undisturbed, quiet even. This suggests that either a massive star that caused the fast radio burst was born another way, or that this powerful burst was created by something else entirely,\" he said.Co-author Dr. Karen Lee-Waddell, Director of the Australian SKA Regional Center and the Project Scientist of WALLABY, said astronomers can so far study the \"host\" galaxy for only a few fast radio bursts and this new discovery highlights the importance of finding many more.\"Research like this is necessary for studying the environments around the mysterious radio bursts, as galaxies are made up of more than just stars.\"We are keen to study fast radio bursts and their host galaxies in great detail, not just to solve an intergalactic mystery but because they can tell us more about the structure and evolution of galaxy systems,\" she said.Two teams of researchers are using ASKAP's unique capabilities to investigate these enigmatic events and their host galaxies simultaneously.Key to this ongoing research is the telescope's unique ability to analyze the gas distribution in galaxies, including hunting for the signatures that could help astronomers better understand the cosmic flashes.Dr. George Heald, Science Program Director for CSIRO's Australia Telescope National Facility, said ASKAP's greatest strength is its ability to quickly survey a large area of sky.\"Each of ASKAP's 36 dish antennas is equipped with a specialized receiver that radio astronomers can steer to efficiently map the sky,\" Dr. Heald said.\"This helps researchers produce some of the best radio astronomy data in the world, to better understand the universe,\" he said.Fast radio bursts were discovered in 2007 using CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope, Murriyang.

  "answer_race": " A new way to search for habitable planets.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the region between the star and the soot line in planet-forming disks?",
  "answer_squad": " soot line",
  "text": "A University of Michigan astronomer and his team are suggesting a new way to expand the search for habitable planets that takes into account a zone not previously considered: the space between the star and what's called soot line in planet-forming disks.          Worlds that form in this region\u2014a disk of dust rotating around a central star from which planets may be built\u2014could have surfaces rich in volatile carbon compounds quite different from Earth's. These planets would also be rich in organic carbon, but water poor, according to Ted Bergin, who led the study that included geochemists, planetary scientists, astrochemists and exoplanet experts.When we search for Earth-like planets, we are particularly interested not only in bodies that look like ours, but also in those that are formed by processes similar to ours. Current models of rocky exoplanets are built using Earth-like atmospheric conditions and bulk composition, including the molecules essential for life that form from carbon-based building blocks and water.These models also focus on zones within planet-forming disks called ice lines, regions distant enough from the disk's center star which mark where water or other key molecules transition from gas to solid phases.Terrestrial worlds, like our planet, formed from solids. It has long been thought that Earth, which contains only approximately 0.1% water by mass, must have formed inside the water-ice line.But that type of model may be too limited, Bergin said. To expand the search for habitable planets, Bergin and his research team suggest a new model that considers the soot line, a boundary closer to the solar system's star. Between this boundary and the star, organic compounds in solids sublimate out of the solid into gas. Considering this region would also encompass rocky planets that may have more carbon than Earth has, raising questions about what that means for habitability in these kinds of planets.The findings by the interdisciplinary research team are published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\"It adds a new dimension in our search for habitability. It may be a negative dimension or it may be a positive dimension,\" Bergin said. \"It's exciting because it leads to all kinds of endless possibilities.\"Just as Earth is poor in water, it is carbon poor as well, Bergin said. When forming, it likely received only 1 carbon atom per 100 available in planet-forming materials. Astronomers think the soot line explains why Earth has so little carbon. If Earth's building blocks formed inside the soot line, the temperature and solar radiation blasted the materials that would form the young planet, turning carbon-rich compounds into gas and limiting carbon in the solids that are supplied to the forming Earth.The team's model theorizes about the formation of other planets born in between the soot line and water-ice lines.Such a world does not appear to exist in our solar system, but our solar system is not representative of most known planetary systems around other stars, Bergin said. These other planetary systems look completely different. Their planets are closer to the sun and are much larger, ranging in size from what are called super-Earths to mini-Neptunes, he said.\"These are either big rocks or small gas giants\u2014that's the most common type of planetary system. So maybe, within all those other solar systems out in the Milky Way galaxy, there exists a population of bodies that we haven't recognized before that have much more carbon in their interiors. What are the consequences of that?\" Bergin said. \"What this means for habitability needs to be explored.\"In their study, the team models what happens when a silicate-rich world with 0.1% and 1% carbon by mass and a variable water content forms in the soot line region. They found that such a planet would develop a methane-rich atmosphere through a process called outgassing. In this circumstance, organic compounds in a silicate-rich planet produce a methane-rich atmosphere.The presence of methane provides a fertile environment for the generation of hazes through interactions with stellar photons. This is analogous to the generation of hazes from methane in Titan in our own solar system.\"Planets that are born within this region, which exists in every planet-forming disk system, will release more volatile carbon from their mantles,\" Bergin said. \"This could readily lead to the natural production of hazes. Such hazes have been observed in the atmospheres of exoplanets and have the potential to change the calculus for what we consider habitable worlds.\"Haze around a planet might be a signpost that the planet has volatile carbon in its mantle. And more carbon, the backbone of life, in the mantle of a planet means that the planet has a chance to be considered habitable\u2014or at least deserves a second glance, Bergin said.\"If this is true, then there could be a common class of haze planets with abundant volatile carbon, and what that means for habitability needs to be explored,\" he said. \"But then there's the other aspect: What if you have an Earth-sized world, where you have more carbon than Earth has? What does that mean for habitability, for life? We don't know, and that's exciting.\" More information:Edwin A.

  "text": "A study led by researchers of the University of Li\u00e8ge and the CSIC\u2014using observations from NASA's TESS telescope\u2014presents the detection of a system of two planets slightly larger than Earth orbiting a cold star in a synchronized dance. Named TOI-2096, the system is located 150 light-years from Earth.          The discovery is the result of a close collaboration between European and American universities and was made possible by the US space mission TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite), which aims to find planets orbiting nearby bright stars.\"TESS is conducting an all-sky survey using the transit method, that is, monitoring the stellar brightness of thousands of stars in the search for a slight dimming, which could be caused by a planet passing between the star and the observer. However, despite its power to detect new worlds, the TESS mission needs support from ground-based telescopes to confirm the planetary nature of the detected signals,\" explains Francisco J. Pozuelos, astrophysicist, first author of the paper, former member of the ExoTIC laboratory at the Univeristy of Li\u00e8ge, and who has now joined the Spanish National Research Council (IAA-CSIC).The planets TOI-2096 b and TOI-2096 c were observed with an international network of ground-based telescopes, allowing their confirmation and characterization. The majority of the transits were obtained with telescopes of the TRAPPIST and SPECULOOS projects led by the University of Li\u00e8ge.\"Making an exhaustive analysis of the data, we found that the two planets were in resonant orbits: for each orbit of the outer planet, the inner planet orbits the star twice,\" says Mathilde Timmermans, a doctoral student at the ExoTIC lab at ULi\u00e8ge and second author of the paper published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.\"Their periods are therefore very close to being a multiple of each other with about 3.12 days for planet b and about 6.38 days for planet c. This is a very particular configuration, and it causes a strong gravitational interaction between the planets. This interaction delays or accelerates the passage of the planets in front of their star and could lead to the measurement of the planetary masses using larger telescopes in the near future.\"The researchers behind the discovery estimate that the radius of planet b\u2014the closest to its star\u2014is 1.2 times that of Earth, hence the name 'super-Earth'. Its properties could be similar to Earth's: a planet with a mostly rocky composition, possibly surrounded by a thin atmosphere. Similarly, the radius of planet c is 1.9 times the radius of the Earth and 55% that of Neptune, which could place the planet in the category of 'mini-Neptunes,' planets composed of a rocky and icy core surrounded by extended hydrogen- or water-rich atmospheres, such as Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.These sizes are very interesting because the number of planets with a radius between 1.5 and 2.5 Earth radii is smaller than what theoretical models predict, making these planets a rarity.\"These planets are of crucial importance given their sizes,\" notes Mathilde Timmermans, \"the formation of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes remains a mystery today. There are several formation models trying to explain it, but none fits the observations perfectly. TOI-2096 is the only system found to date that has a super-Earth and a mini-Neptune precisely at the sizes where the models contradict each other. In other words, TOI-2096 may be the system we've been looking for to understand how these planetary systems have formed.\"\"Furthermore, these planets are among the best in their category to study their possible atmospheres,\" explains Francisco J. Pozuelos.\"Thanks to the relative sizes of the planets with respect to the host star, as well as the brightness of the star, we find that this system is one of the best candidates for a detailed study of their atmosphere with the JWST space telescope. We hope to be able to do this quickly by coordinating with other universities and research centers.

  "text": "Much of our understanding of the universe and its mysterious phenomena is based on theoretical interpretations. In order to deepen the understanding of distant objects and energetic phenomena, astronomers are looking at cosmic rays, which are high-energy charged particles composed of protons, electrons, atomic nuclei, and other subatomic particles.          Such studies have revealed that cosmic rays contain all the elements known to us in the periodic table, suggesting that these elements originate from stars and high-energy events such as supernovae. Additionally, due to their charged nature, the path of cosmic rays through space is influenced by the magnetic fields of interstellar phenomena and objects.Detailed observations of cosmic rays can, thus, not only shed light on the origins of these particles but also decode the existence of high-energy objects and phenomena such as supernova remnants, pulsars, and even dark matter. In an effort to better observe high-energy radiations, Japan, Italy, and USA collaboratively established the CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) on the International Space Station in 2015.In 2018, observations of the cosmic ray proton spectrum from 50 GeV to 10 TeV revealed that the particle flux of protons at high energies was significantly higher than expected. These results deviated from the conventional cosmic ray acceleration and propagation models that assume a \"single power-law distribution,\" wherein the number of particles decrease with increasing energy.Consequently, in a study published in 2022, the CALET team, including researchers from Waseda University, found cosmic ray protons in the energy range of 50 GeV to 60 TeV to follow a \"Double Broken Power Law.\" This law assumes that the number of high-energy particles initially increase until 10 TeV (known as spectral hardening) and then decrease with an increase in energy (known as spectral softening).Extending these observations further, the team has now found similar trends of spectral hardening and softening in the cosmic ray helium spectrum captured over a broad range of energy, from 40 GeV to 250 TeV.The study, published in the journal Physical Review Letters, was led by Associate Professor Kazuyoshi Kobayashi from Waseda University, Japan, along with contributions from Professor Emeritus Shoji Torii, Principal Investigator of the CALET project, also affiliated with Waseda University, and Research Assistant Paolo Brogi from the University of Siena in Italy.\"CALET has successfully observed energy spectral structure of cosmic ray helium, especially spectral hardening starting from around 1.3 TeV, and the tendency of softening starting from around 30 TeV,\" says Kobayashi.These observations are based on data collected by CALET aboard the International Space Station (ISS) between 2015 to 2022. Representing the largest energy range to date for cosmic helium nuclei particles, these observations provide additional evidence for deviation of the particle flux from the single power-law model. The researchers noticed that deviation from the expected power-law distribution was more than eight standard deviations away from the mean, indicating a very low probability of this deviation occurring by chance.Notably, the initial spectral hardening observed in this data suggests that there may be unique sources or mechanisms that are responsible for accelerating and propagating the helium nuclei to high energies. The discovery of these spectral features is also supported by recent observations from the Dark Matter Particle Explorer, and questions our current understanding of the origin and nature of cosmic rays.\"These results would significantly contribute to the understanding of cosmic ray acceleration in the supernova remnant and propagation mechanism,\" says Torii.These findings undoubtedly enhance our understanding of the universe. Even as we prepare for manned missions to the moon and Mars, the energy distribution of cosmic ray particles can also provide further insight into the radiation environment in space and its effects on astronauts.

  "text": "Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy and Ludwig Maximilians University Munich have proposed a new scenario for the emergence of the first building blocks for life on Earth, roughly 4 billion years ago.          By experiment, they showed how iron particles from meteors and from volcanic ash could have served as catalysts for converting a carbon-dioxide rich early atmosphere into hydrocarbons, but also acetaldehyde and formaldehyde, which in turn can serve as building blocks for fatty acids, nucleobases, sugars and amino acids. Their article, \"Synthesis of prebiotic organics from CO2 by catalysis with meteoritic and volcanic particles,\" is published in the journal Scientific Reports.To the best of our current knowledge, life on Earth emerged a mere 400 to 700 million years after the Earth itself had formed. That is a fairly quick development. For comparison, consider that afterwards, it took about 2 billion years for the first proper (eukaryotic) cells to form. The first step towards the emergence of life is the formation of organic molecules that can serve as building blocks for organisms. Given how fast life itself arose, it would be plausible for this comparatively simple first step to have been completed quickly, as well.The research described here presents a new way for such organic compounds to form on planetary scales under the conditions prevalent on the early Earth. The key supporting role goes to iron particles produced from meteorites, which act as a catalyst. Catalysts are substances whose presence speeds up specific chemical reactions, but which do not get used up in those reactions. In that way, they are akin to the tools used in manufacture: Tools are necessary to produce, say, a car, but after one car is built, the tools can be used to build the next one.From industrial chemistry to the beginnings of the EarthKey inspiration for the research came, of all things, from industrial chemistry. Specifically, Oliver Trapp, a professor at Ludwig Maximilians University, Munich, and Max Planck Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA), wondered whether the so-called Fischer\u2013Tropsch process for converting carbon monoxide and hydrogen into hydrocarbons in the presence of metallic catalysts might not have had an analog on an early Earth with a carbon-dioxide-rich atmosphere.\"When I looked at the chemical composition of the Campo-del-Cielo iron meteorite, consisting of iron, nickel, some cobalt and tiny amounts of iridium, I immediately realized that this is a perfect Fischer-Tropsch catalyst,\" explains Trapp. The logical next step was to set up an experiment to test the cosmic version of Fischer-Tropsch.Dmitry Semenov, a staff member at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, says, \"When Oliver told me about his idea to experimentally investigate the catalytic properties of iron meteorite particles to synthesize building blocks for life, my first thought was that we should also study the catalytic properties of volcanic ash particles. After all, the early Earth should have been geologically active. There should have been plenty of fine ash particles in the atmosphere and on Earth's first land masses.\"      Re-creating cosmic catalysisFor their experiments, Trapp and Semenov teamed up with Trapp's Ph.D. student Sophia Peters, who would run the experiments as part of her Ph.D. work. For access to meteorites and minerals, as well as expertise in the analysis of such materials, they reached out to mineralogist Rupert Hochleitner, an expert on meteorites at the Mineralogische Staatssammlung in Munich.The first ingredient for the experiments was always a source of iron particles. In different versions of the experiment, those iron particles might be iron from an actual iron meteorite, or particles from an iron-containing stone meteorite, or volcanic ash from Mount Etna, the latter as a stand-in for the iron-rich particles that would be present on the early Earth with its highly active volcanism. Next, the iron particles were mixed with different minerals such as might be found on the early Earth. These minerals would act as a support structure. Catalysts are commonly found as small particles on a suitable substrate.Producing small particlesParticle size matters. The fine volcanic ash particles produced by volcanic eruptions are typically a few micrometers in size. For meteorites falling through the atmosphere of the early Earth, on the other hand, atmospheric friction would ablate nanometer-size iron particles. The impact of an iron meteorite (or of the iron core of a larger asteroid) would produce micrometer-sized iron particles directly through fragmentation, and nanometer-sized particles as iron evaporated in the intense heat and later-on condensed again in the surrounding air.The researchers aimed to reproduce this variety of particle sizes in two different ways. By dissolving the meteoric material in acid, they produced nanometer-sized particles from their prepared material. And by putting either the meteoritic material or the volcanic ash into a ball mill for 15 minutes, the researchers could produce larger, micrometer-sized particles. Such a ball mill is a drum containing both the material and steel balls, which is rotated at high speeds, in this case more than ten times per second, with the steel balls grinding up the material.Since Earth's initial atmosphere did not contain oxygen, the researchers then followed up with chemical reactions that would remove almost all of the oxygen from the mixture.Producing organic molecules under pressureAs the last step in each version of the experiment, the mixture was brought into a pressure chamber filled with (mostly) carbon dioxide CO2 and (some) hydrogen molecules, chosen so as to simulate the atmosphere of the early Earth. Both the exact mixture and the pressure were varied between experiments.The results were impressive: Thanks to the iron catalyst, organic compounds such as methanol, ethanol and acetaldehyde were produced, but also formaldehyde. That is an encouraging harvest\u2014acetaldehyde and formaldehyde in particular are important building blocks for fatty acids, nucleobases (themselves the building blocks of DNA), sugars and amino acids.Importantly, these reactions took place successfully under a variety of pressure and temperature conditions. Sophia Peters says, \"Since there are many different possibilities for the properties of the early Earth, I tried to experimentally test every possible scenario. In the end, I used fifty different catalysts, and ran the experiment at various values for the pressure, the temperature, and the ratio of carbon dioxide and hydrogen molecules.\" That the organic molecules formed under such a variety of condition is a strong indication that reactions like these could have taken place on the early Earth\u2014whatever its precise atmospheric conditions will turn out to be.Adding a scenario to the portfolio of possible mechanismsWith these results, there is now a new contender for how the first building blocks of life were formed on Earth. Joining the ranks of \"classic\" mechanisms such as organic synthesis near hot vents on the ocean floor, or electric discharge in a methane-rich atmosphere (as in the Urey-Miller experiment), and of models that predict how organic compounds could have formed in the depth of space and transported to Earth by asteroids or comets (see this MPIA press release), there is now another possibility: meteoric iron particles or fine volcanic ash acting as catalysts in an early, carbon-dioxide-rich atmosphere.With this spread of possibilities, learning more about the atmospheric composition and physical properties of the early Earth should allow researchers to deduce, eventually, which of the various mechanisms will give the highest yield of building blocks under the given conditions\u2014and which thus was likely the most important mechanism for the first steps from non-life to life on our home planet.

  "answer_squad": " the conversion of carbon dioxide into hydrocarbons, aldehydes and alcohols",
  "text": "Precursors of the molecules needed for the origin of life may have been generated by chemical reactions promoted by iron-rich particles from meteors or volcanic eruptions on Earth approximately 4.4 billion years ago, according to a study published in Scientific Reports.Previous research has suggested that the precursors of organic molecules\u2014hydrocarbons, aldehydes and alcohols\u2014may have been delivered by asteroids and comets or produced by reactions in the early Earth's atmosphere and oceans. These reactions may have been promoted by energy from lightning, volcanic activity, or impacts. However a lack of data has meant that it is unclear what the predominant mechanism that produced these precursors was.Oliver Trapp and colleagues investigated whether meteorite or ash particles deposited on volcanic islands could have promoted the conversion of atmospheric carbon dioxide to the precursors of organic molecules on the early Earth. They simulated a range of conditions that previous research has suggested may have been present on the early Earth by placing carbon dioxide gas in a heated and pressurized system (an autoclave) under pressures ranging between nine and 45 bars and temperatures ranging between 150\u00b0C and 300\u00b0C.They also simulated wet and dry climate conditions by adding either hydrogen gas or water to the system. They mimicked the depositing of meteorite or ash particles on volcanic islands by adding different combinations of crushed samples of iron meteorites, stony meteorites, or volcanic ash into the system, as well as minerals that may have been present in the early Earth and are found in either the Earth's crust, meteorites, or asteroids.The authors found that the iron-rich particles from meteorites and volcanic ash promoted the conversion of carbon dioxide into hydrocarbons, aldehydes and alcohols across a range of atmosphere and climate conditions that may have been present in the early Earth. They observed that aldehydes and alcohols formed at lower temperatures while hydrocarbons formed at 300\u00b0C. The authors suggest that as the early Earth's atmosphere cooled over time, the production of alcohols and aldehydes may have increased.These compounds may then have participated in further reactions that could have led to the formation of carbohydrates, lipids, sugars, amino acids, DNA, and RNA. By calculating the rate of the reactions they observed and using data from previous research on the conditions of the early Earth, the authors estimate that their proposed mechanism could have synthesized up to 600,000 tons of organic precursors per year across the early Earth.The authors propose that their mechanism may have contributed to the origins of life on Earth, in combination with other reactions in the early Earth's atmosphere and oceans.

  "text": "Using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), an international team of astronomers has discovered a new hot, bloated \"super-Neptune\" exoplanet. The newfound alien world, designated TOI-2498 b, is about six times larger and 35 times more massive than the Earth. The finding was published May 16 in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.          TESS is conducting a survey of about 200,000 of the brightest stars near the sun with the aim of searching for transiting exoplanets, ranging from small rocky worlds to gaseous giants. So far, it has identified nearly 6,600 candidate exoplanets (TESS Objects of Interest, or TOI), of which 331 have been confirmed to date.One of the stars observed by TESS during its primary mission was TOI-2498 (also known as TIC-263179590)\u2014a G-type solar-type star about 26% larger and 12% more massive than the sun. TESS monitored TOI-2498 between December 12, 2018, and January 6, 2019, which resulted in the detection of a transit signal in its light curve. Planetary nature of this signal was confirmed by follow-up spectroscopic and photometric observations conducted by astronomers led by Ginger Frame of the University of Warwick, U.K.\"In this work, we have presented the discovery of a hot, bloated super-Neptune transiting a G type star. Our analysis includes photometry from TESS sector 6 and sector 33, follow-up ground-based photometry from LCOGT and spectroscopy from HARPS,\" the researchers wrote.The newfound planet has a radius of about 6.06 Earth radii and its mass is estimated to be 34.62 Earth masses, yielding a density at a level of 0.86 g/cm3. It orbits its host star every 3.74 days, at a distance of some 0.05 AU from it. The planet's equilibrium temperature was calculated to be about 1,443 K.Based on the results, Frame's team classified TOI-2498 b as a hot and bloated \"super-Neptune.\" The planet's low density is indicative of the presence of a gaseous envelope that consists of approximately 27% of its mass. However, the astronomers added that their planetary model assumes no water content or significant atmospheric metallicity of TOI-2498 b.Summing up the results, the researchers noted that TOI-2498 b is a stable \"super-Neptune\" that has experienced little evaporation throughout its lifetime, relative to its mass. They suppose that the planet, after formation, might have started out as a puffy Saturn-sized world about 8\u201310 times larger than Earth and an envelope mass fraction of between 30% and 45%. The age of the planet was estimated to be some 3.6 billion years.\"We find that TOI-2498 b likely started its life as a puffy Saturn-sized world before shrinking to its current size over 3.6 \u00b1 1.1 Gyr,\" the authors of the paper concluded.

Virgin Orbit will cease operations and sell its assets to four winning bidders, the company announced Tuesday. Those bidders include three aerospace companies\u2014Rocket Lab, Stratolaunch and Vast Space subsidiary Launcher\u2014with combined bids totaling almost $36 million, according to court documents.A sale hearing for court approval is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon and transactions are expected to close soon after, the company said.\"Virgin Orbit's legacy in the space industry will forever be remembered,\" Virgin Orbit said in a Tuesday statement. \"Its groundbreaking technologies, relentless pursuit of excellence, and unwavering commitment to advancing the frontiers of air launch have left an indelible mark on the industry.\"The move to sell and cease operations arrives amid a tumultuous period for the Long Beach, California-based company. On April 4, Virgin Orbit filed for bankruptcy protection shortly after laying off about 85% of its workforce. The satellite launcher notably faced increased difficulty raising funding following a failed international mission earlier this year.In January, a mission by Virgin Orbit to launch the first satellites into orbit from Cornwall in southwest England failed after a rocket's upper stage prematurely shut down. It was a setback in the U.K., which had hoped that the launch would mark the beginning of more commercial opportunities for the region's space industry.A following investigation found that its rocket's fuel filter had become dislodged, the company said in February, causing an engine to become overheated and other components to malfunction over the Atlantic Ocean.Virgin Orbit was founded in 2017 by Branson, a British billionaire, in hopes of targeting the market for launching small satellites into space. Its LauncherOne rockets were launched from the air from modified Virgin passenger planes, allowing the company to operate more flexibly than using fixed launch sites.For the third quarter of 2022, Virgin Orbit reported a revenue of $30.9 million and net loss of $43.6 million.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

  "question_squad": " What is the mass of the black hole in J1144?",
  "answer_squad": " 2.6 billion solar masses",
  "text": "Using various space telescopes, an international team of astronomers have observed a recently detected luminous quasar known as SMSS J114447.77-430859.3, or J1144 for short. Results of the observational campaign, available in the July 2023 edition of Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, shed more light on the properties of this source.          Quasars, or quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) are active galactic nuclei (AGN) of very high luminosity, emitting electromagnetic radiation observable in radio, infrared, visible, ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths. They are among the brightest and most distant objects in the known universe, and serve as fundamental tools for numerous studies in astrophysics as well as cosmology. For instance, quasars have been used to investigate the large-scale structure of the universe and the era of reionization. They also improved our understanding of the dynamics of supermassive black holes and the intergalactic medium.J1144 was detected in June 2022 at a redshift of 0.83. It has a bolometric luminosity of about 470 quattuordecillion erg/s, which makes it the most luminous quasar over the last 9 billion years of cosmic history. It is also the optically brightest (unbeamed) quasar at a redshift greater than 0.4.It is estimated that the mass of the black hole in J1144 is approximately 2.6 billion solar masses. This value, together with the high bolometric luminosity, yields an Eddington ratio at a level of 1.4 for this quasar.A group of astronomers led by Elias Kammoun of the University of Toulouse, France, has conducted X-ray observations of this quasar using Spektr-RG, Swift, NuSTAR and XMM-Newton space telescopes. These four space observatories allowed them to gain more insights into the properties of J1144.The observational campaign found that J1144 exhibits an X-ray variability by a factor of about 10 within a year. Moreover, the results indicate also a shorter timescale variability of the order of approximately 2.7 within 40 days. According to the authors of the study, the large X-ray variability is due to intrinsic changes in the X-ray luminosity of the source accompanied with changes in the absorption in the line of sight.The observations indicate that J1144 seems to accrete at a rate larger than 40% of the Eddington limit. However, the astronomers noted that If the black hole spin is relatively low, the accretion rate can even exceed the Eddington limit.The researchers underlined that the X-ray and optical properties of J1144 are different from many high-Eddington sources. They suppose that this source may be a standard radio-quiet quasar rather than a high-Eddington quasi-stellar object.The authors of the paper added that deeper X-ray and ultraviolet/optical observations of J1144 are needed to draw final conclusions about the nature of this source and its variability.

  "answer_squad": " Juno",
  "text": "A team of space scientists affiliated with several institutions in Czechia, Japan and the U.S. has found evidence of lightning pulses on Jupiter that are similar to those found on Earth. In their study, reported in the journal Nature Communications, the group examined years of data from the Juno space probe circling Jupiter.          Juno, the NASA space probe, was launched in 2011 and entered a polar orbit around Jupiter in 2016. Since that time it has been orbiting the planet, sending back a constant stream of data from its onboard sensors. Its main mission has been to gain more accurate measurements of Jupiter's gravitational and magnetic fields and to collect data regarding its polar magnetism. Other sensors have been collecting information regarding the planet's atmosphere and wind patterns.In this new effort, the research team analyzed radio data collected by the probe over a five-year period that could be associated with lightning strikes within its clouds. They discovered that bolts tend to pulse through clouds in ways similar to intracloud bolts on Earth (at approximately 1 millisecond intervals). They also found that the bolts tend to extend through clouds at a velocity similar to bolts on Earth. They compare lightning strike dynamics on both planets to a winded human biker traveling up a mountain who pauses following a given step to catch her breath before beginning another step. The group also found evidence that such bolts might branch and extend in ways similar to bolts on Earth. They suggest that if that is the case, it could have implications for scientists looking for life on other more habitable planets.Prior research has shown that lightning on Earth occurs due to turbulence forcing ice and water droplets together\u2014the resulting friction generates a charge that is released when the water and ice wind up on opposite sides of a cloud. The new findings suggest that a similar process is likely at work on Jupiter. The research team notes that they were not surprised by their findings\u2014the physics for discharging clouds, they note, should be very much the same, regardless of the planet on which they occur.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the satellite that South Korea was set to launch on Wednesday?",
  "answer_squad": " Nuri",
  "text": "South Korea canceled its planned launch Wednesday of its first commercial-grade satellite due to a technical issue, days after rival North Korea reaffirmed its push to place its first military spy satellite into orbit.          The cancellation was announced about two hours before South Korea's homegrown Nuri space launch vehicle carrying eight satellites\u2014including the main, commercial-grade one\u2014was scheduled to lift off from a southern launch facility.Oh Tae-seok, the first vice-minister of science, told a televised news conference a communication anomaly between the launch control computer and the launch pad control computer was found during the launch preparation process. He said South Korea will consider rescheduling the launch as soon as Thursday, if authorities fix the technical problem early.South Korea's satellite launch plan has been closely watched by outsiders. Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reviewed a finished spy satellite and approved a future action plan on its launch. During his visit to the country's aerospace agency, Kim also mentioned the strategic significance of a spy satellite while vowing to defend against \"confrontational moves\" by South Korean and U.S. forces, according to state media.Animosities on the Korean Peninsula remain high.Since the start of 2022, North Korea has test-launched more than 100 missiles\u2014some of them nuclear-capable weapons designed to strike South Korea and the U.S.\u2014in what it called efforts to respond to the expansion of military drills between the United States and South Korea. Analysts say the North's testing spree was likely meant to pressure its rivals to scale back their military training and relax economic sanctions on the North.Jung Chang Wook, head of the Korea Defense Study Forum think tank in Seoul, said the recent North Korean push for a spy satellite launch suggests it cares greatly about the South Korean satellite launch program.South Korean officials say their commercial-grade satellite launch has no military purpose. But many experts say it will eventually help South Korea acquire technologies and knowhow required to operate military surveillance satellites and build more powerful missiles.      South Korea already has missiles that place all of North Korea within striking distance. But Jung said South Korea needs longer-range missiles to prepare for future security threats that can be posed by potential adversaries like China and Russia.                In this photo released by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, the Nuri rocket sits on its launch pad at the Naro Space Center in Goheung, South Korea, Tuesday, May 23, 2023. South Korea was set to launch its first commercial-grade satellite, on Wednesday as rival North KoreaCredit: Korea Aerospace Research Institute via AP             Lee Choon Geun, an honorary research fellow at South Korea's Science and Technology Policy Institute, said that the use of the Nuri rocket as a missile isn't militarily meaningful as it uses a type of liquid fuel that requires much longer fueling time than solid fuel.But he said there is \"enough possibility\" that the launch will support South Korea's efforts to build a space-based surveillance system, as its commercial-grade satellite is to be placed on a sun-synchronous orbit, which is typically used by reconnaissance satellites.South Korea currently has no military reconnaissance satellites of its own and depends on U.S. spy satellites to monitor strategic facilities in North Korea. South Korea seeks to launch its own surveillance satellites soon.Some experts say the North Korean spy satellite disclosed in its state media doesn't appear to be sophisticated enough to produce high-resolution imagery that can meaningfully boost the country's surveillance capacities.But Lee said the North Korean satellite is still likely be capable of monitoring the deployment of incoming U.S. strategic assets like an aircraft carrier and the movements of South Korean warships and fighter jets.After its first spy satellite launch, Lee predicted North Korea will try to send several more satellites into space, likely more advanced ones. \"With three to five satellites, North Korea can have an almost real-time monitoring on the Korean Peninsula,\" he said.Lee said the North's first spy satellite launch could happen in June. Other experts say the launch will more likely happen in the latter half of this year.Wednesday's canceled launch of South Korea's satellite would have been the third of its kind involving Nuri.In its second launch last year, South Korea successfully put what it called a \"performance verification satellite\" into orbit, becoming the world's 10th nation to send a satellite into space with its own technology.

The U.N. viewed the North's past launches of Earth observation satellites as a disguised test of its long-range missile technology because ballistic missiles and space launch vehicles often share similar bodies, engines and other components.South Korea currently has no military reconnaissance satellites of its own and depends on U.S. spy satellites to monitor strategic facilities in North Korea. South Korea seeks to launch its own surveillance satellites soon.Jung said while the South Korean satellite to be launched Wednesday wasn't primarily developed for military purposes, its launch will still give it technologies related to the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles and military spy satellites.\"It's just a matter of how we (publicly) describe a launch.

  "answer_squad": " lava world",
  "text": "In the past 30 years, more than 5,000 planets have been discovered outside our solar system. One common exoplanet is the lava world, a hot super-Earth with oceans of liquid lava. Mantas Zilinskas developed models to simulate possible atmospheres of these worlds. Those simulations provide guidance for astronomers searching for these atmospheres with the James Webb Space Telescope. Zilinskas will receive his Ph.D. on Wednesday, May 24.          Most of the exoplanets observed do not resemble the eight plants in our solar system. For example, there are hot Jupiters, gas giants that are closer to their parent star than Mercury is to the sun, and rostral lava worlds, which are larger than Earth and orbit their parent star so closely that lava oceans flow.We know little about these distant worlds, says Mantas Zilinskas. Some features astronomers can estimate based on mass, radius and distance from the parent star. But that does not give a complete picture. To find out more about their atmospheres, astronomers therefore use spectroscopy. In this, they measure the light from the parent star that shines through the exoplanet's atmosphere and then traveled to Earth. The molecules and atoms present in an atmosphere absorb unique colors of light. This creates a unique fingerprint for each exoplanet by which you can tell what substances its atmosphere contains.But deriving the properties from spectroscopy observations is not easy. That is why theoretical astrophysicists like Zilinskas create mathematical models that predict how certain properties translate into observations. \"I calculate what astronomers might observe,\" he explains. \"The purpose of my simulations is to tell astronomers what to look for and what that can tell them about exoplanets.\"Zilinskas focused his Ph.D. research on atmospheres of lava worlds and their observation with the James Webb Space Telescope launched in late 2021. \"These atmospheres have not yet been detected, but we think they exist. Indeed, silicate-rich gases can evaporate from lava oceans to form a thin, tenuous atmosphere,\" he says. \"We are trying to use models to predict the chemical composition and important properties of those atmospheres, such as temperature changes. And we look at how that affects the light spectrum.\"To do this, Zilinskas used so-called one-dimensional models, which assume that the greatest chemical changes in the atmosphere occur in the vertical direction\u2014from top to bottom\u2014and not in the horizontal. The models calculate the chemical conditions at each point. Zilinskas combined that with radiative transfer models that calculate how light from the parent star moves through that atmosphere and how the spectrum changes in the process.\"There are also two- and three-dimensional models, but these take a lot of time and computational power,\" says Zilinskas. \"Moreover, we know little about lava worlds and the faster and more flexible one-dimensional models give us the freedom to investigate many different, possible atmospheric compositions.\"The simulations showed that the James Webb Space Telescope can observe the atmospheres of lava worlds, if they exist. \"It also showed what a big step forward this space telescope is,\" says Zilinskas.Currently, the space telescope is still observing exoplanets, including lava worlds. Zilinskas says, \"I hope my Ph.D. research can serve as a guide for future observations of atmospheres of lava worlds.\" Provided byLeiden UniversityCitation:How do you recognize the atmosphere of extraterrestrial lava worlds?

  "answer_squad": " Uranus",
  "text": "Scientists used ground-based telescopes to get unprecedented views, thanks to the giant planet's position in its long orbit around the sun.          For the first time, NASA scientists have strong evidence of a polar cyclone on Uranus. By examining radio waves emitted from the ice giant, they detected the phenomenon at the planet's north pole. The findings confirm a broad truth about all planets with substantial atmospheres in our solar system: Whether the planets are composed mainly of rock or gas, their atmospheres show signs of a swirling vortex at the poles.Scientists have long known that Uranus' south pole has a swirling feature. NASA's Voyager 2 imaging of methane cloud tops there showed winds at the polar center spinning faster than over the rest of the pole. Voyager's infrared measurements observed no temperature changes, but the new findings, published in Geophysical Research Letters, do.Using huge radio antenna dishes of the Very Large Array in New Mexico, they peered below the ice giant's clouds, determining that the circulating air at the north pole seems to be warmer and drier\u2014the hallmarks of a strong cyclone. Collected in 2015, 2021, and 2022, the observations went deeper into Uranus' atmosphere than any before.\"These observations tell us a lot more about the story of Uranus. It's a much more dynamic world than you might think,\" said lead author Alex Akins of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"It isn't just a plain blue ball of gas. There's a lot happening under the hood.\"                This image of Uranus was taken by NASA\u2019s Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1986. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech             Uranus is showing off more these days, thanks to the planet's position in orbit. It's a long haul around the solar system for this outer planet, taking 84 years to complete a full lap, and for the last few decades the poles weren't pointed toward Earth. Since about 2015, scientists have had a better view and have been able to look deeper into the polar atmosphere.Ingredients for a cycloneThe cyclone on Uranus, compactly shaped with warm and dry air at its core, is much like those spotted by NASA's Cassini at Saturn. With the new findings, cyclones (which rotate in the same direction their planet rotates) or anti-cyclones (which rotate in the opposite direction) have now been identified at the poles on every planet in our solar system except for Mercury, which has no substantial atmosphere.      But unlike hurricanes on Earth, cyclones on Uranus and Saturn aren't formed over water (neither planet is known to have liquid water), and they don't drift; they're locked at the poles. Researchers will be watching closely to see how this newly discovered Uranus cyclone evolves in the coming years.\"Does the warm core we observed represent the same high-speed circulation seen by Voyager?\" Akins asked. \"Or are there stacked cyclones in Uranus' atmosphere? The fact that we're still finding out such simple things about how Uranus' atmosphere works really gets me excited to find out more about this mysterious planet.\"The National Academies' 2023 Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey prioritized exploring Uranus. In preparation for such a mission, planetary scientists are focused on bolstering their knowledge about the mysterious ice giant's system.

Like today, nitrogen in the atmosphere of early Earth was mainly present in the form of unreactive N2-molecules, denying organisms easy access to this resource.Some microorganisms are capable of converting N2 gas into bioavailable forms like ammonium, but before the emergence of this metabolism, energetic processes such as lightning must have been responsible for breaking apart these N2 molecules.To investigate how lightning can make nitrogen available for life, researchers at the University of St Andrews, together with colleagues from the Space Research Institute (IWF) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Graz and from Brown University in the U.S., conducted a series of spark discharge experiments.They filled glass flasks with water and different gas mixtures, resembling the atmospheres of modern and early Earth, and then subjected these gas mixtures to an electric discharge of nearly 50,000 volts. After the experiments, the scientists measured the composition of the gas mixture and water and detected increased concentrations of nitric oxide, nitrite, and nitrate.Patrick Barth, first author of this study and Ph.D. student at the St Andrews Centre for Exoplanet and the IWF, said, \"Our results show that lightning can efficiently produce nitrogen oxides in the CO2-rich atmosphere that likely existed on early Earth. This provides a potential source of nutrients for life at that time and on planets outside of our solar system.\"                Measurements of \u03b415N in sedimentary rocks over geologic time, separated by metamorphic grade.

DOI: 10.1038/s41561-023-01187-2             However, the isotopic composition the researchers found in their spark experiments does not match that of nitrogen archived in the rock record of early Earth. This discrepancy suggests that lightning was not a major source of nitrogen as microbial life evolved.Instead, these results provide another piece of evidence that microorganisms have been able to convert N2 gas into bioavailable forms for more than three billion years.There are, however, a few rock samples from the Isua Greenstone Belt on Greenland which are nearly 3.8 billion years old, and whose isotopic composition could potentially be explained by nitrogen contributions from lightning.Dr. Eva St\u00fceken from the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of St Andrews, and a member of the St Andrews Centre for Exoplanet Science, said, \"This suggests that lightning may have supported the earliest life on Earth. Now that we have established the isotope signature of lightning, it may help investigate the origin of nitrate deposits on Mars.\"To communicate the impact of the findings, the team has collaborated with artists to create an exhibition, which includes a video by Patrick Barth on the role of lightning on exoplanets. The research also inspired a short story, \"A Spark in a Flask,\" published in the science fiction anthology \"Around Distant Suns,\" which tells the tale of a robot taking care of spark experiments on the Moon.Professor Christiane Helling, co-founder of the St Andrews Centre for Exoplanet Science and director of the IWF, said, \"To communicate our science, it is important to reflect the extraordinary uniqueness of the Earth's atmosphere in the astronomical context.\" More information:Patrick Barth et al, Isotopic constraints on lightning as a source of fixed nitrogen in Earth's early biosphere, Nature Geoscience (2023).

  "text": "After a three-year hiatus, scientists in the U.S. have just turned on detectors capable of measuring gravitational waves\u2014tiny ripples in space itself that travel through the universe.          Unlike light waves, gravitational waves are nearly unimpeded by the galaxies, stars, gas and dust that fill the universe. This means that by measuring gravitational waves, astrophysicists like me can peek directly into the heart of some of these most spectacular phenomena in the universe.Since 2020, the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory\u2014commonly known as LIGO\u2014has been sitting dormant while it underwent some exciting upgrades. These improvements will significantly boost the sensitivity of LIGO and should allow the facility to observe more-distant objects that produce smaller ripples in spacetime.By detecting more events that create gravitational waves, there will be more opportunities for astronomers to also observe the light produced by those same events. Seeing an event through multiple channels of information, an approach called multi-messenger astronomy, provides astronomers rare and coveted opportunities to learn about physics far beyond the realm of any laboratory testing.Ripples in spacetimeAccording to Einstein's theory of general relativity, mass and energy warp the shape of space and time. The bending of spacetime determines how objects move in relation to one another\u2014what people experience as gravity.Gravitational waves are created when massive objects like black holes or neutron stars merge with one another, producing sudden, large changes in space. The process of space warping and flexing sends ripples across the universe like a wave across a still pond. These waves travel out in all directions from a disturbance, minutely bending space as they do so and ever so slightly changing the distance between objects in their way.Even though the astronomical events that produce gravitational waves involve some of the most massive objects in the universe, the stretching and contracting of space is infinitesimally small. A strong gravitational wave passing through the Milky Way may only change the diameter of the entire galaxy by three feet (one meter).When two massive objects \u2013 like a black hole or a neutron star \u2013 get close together, they rapidly spin around each other and produce gravitational waves. The sound in this NASA visualization represents the frequency of the gravitational waves.The first gravitational wave observationsThough first predicted by Einstein in 1916, scientists of that era had little hope of measuring the tiny changes in distance postulated by the theory of gravitational waves.Around the year 2000, scientists at Caltech, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other universities around the world finished constructing what is essentially the most precise ruler ever built\u2014the LIGO observatory.LIGO is comprised of two separate observatories, with one located in Hanford, Washington, and the other in Livingston, Louisiana. Each observatory is shaped like a giant L with two, 2.5-mile-long (four-kilometer-long) arms extending out from the center of the facility at 90 degrees to each other.To measure gravitational waves, researchers shine a laser from the center of the facility to the base of the L. There, the laser is split so that a beam travels down each arm, reflects off a mirror and returns to the base. If a gravitational wave passes through the arms while the laser is shining, the two beams will return to the center at ever so slightly different times. By measuring this difference, physicists can discern that a gravitational wave passed through the facility.LIGO began operating in the early 2000s, but it was not sensitive enough to detect gravitational waves. So, in 2010, the LIGO team temporarily shut down the facility to perform upgrades to boost sensitivity. The upgraded version of LIGO started collecting data in 2015 and almost immediately detected gravitational waves produced from the merger of two black holes.Since 2015, LIGO has completed three observation runs. The first, run O1, lasted about four months; the second, O2, about nine months; and the third, O3, ran for 11 months before the COVID-19 pandemic forced the facilities to close. Starting with run O2, LIGO has been jointly observing with an Italian observatory called Virgo.Between each run, scientists improved the physical components of the detectors and data analysis methods. By the end of run O3 in March 2020, researchers in the LIGO and Virgo collaboration had detected about 90 gravitational waves from the merging of black holes and neutron stars.The observatories have still not yet achieved their maximum design sensitivity. So, in 2020, both observatories shut down for upgrades yet again.                Astronomers have captured both the gravitational waves and light produced by a single event, the merger of two neutron stars. The change in light can be seen over the course of a few days in the top right inset. Credit: Hubble Space Telescope, NASA and ESA             Making some upgradesScientists have been working on many technological improvements.One particularly promising upgrade involved adding a 1,000-foot (300-meter) optical cavity to improve a technique called squeezing. Squeezing allows scientists to reduce detector noise using the quantum properties of light. With this upgrade, the LIGO team should be able to detect much weaker gravitational waves than before.My teammates and I are data scientists in the LIGO collaboration, and we have been working on a number of different upgrades to software used to process LIGO data and the algorithms that recognize signs of gravitational waves in that data. These algorithms function by searching for patterns that match theoretical models of millions of possible black hole and neutron star merger events. The improved algorithm should be able to more easily pick out the faint signs of gravitational waves from background noise in the data than the previous versions of the algorithms.A hi-def era of astronomyIn early May 2023, LIGO began a short test run\u2014called an engineering run\u2014to make sure everything was working. On May 18, LIGO detected gravitational waves likely produced from a neutron star merging into a black hole.LIGO's 20-month observation run 04 will officially start on May 24, and it will later be joined by Virgo and a new Japanese observatory\u2014the Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector, or KAGRA.While there are many scientific goals for this run, there is a particular focus on detecting and localizing gravitational waves in real time. If the team can identify a gravitational wave event, figure out where the waves came from and alert other astronomers to these discoveries quickly, it would enable astronomers to point other telescopes that collect visible light, radio waves or other types of data at the source of the gravitational wave.Collecting multiple channels of information on a single event\u2014multi-messenger astrophysics\u2014is like adding color and sound to a black-and-white silent film and can provide a much deeper understanding of astrophysical phenomena.Astronomers have only observed a single event in both gravitational waves and visible light to date\u2014the merger of two neutron stars seen in 2017. But from this single event, physicists were able to study the expansion of the universe and confirm the origin of some of the universe's most energetic events known as gamma-ray bursts.With run O4, astronomers will have access to the most sensitive gravitational wave observatories in history and hopefully will collect more data than ever before. My colleagues and I are hopeful that the coming months will result in one\u2014or perhaps many\u2014multi-messenger observations that will push the boundaries of modern astrophysics.

  "text": "Tunnels deep underground in North Yorkshire are providing a unique opportunity to study how humans might be able to live and operate on the moon or on Mars.          Researchers at the University of Birmingham have launched the Bio-SPHERE project in a unique research facility located 1.1 km below the surface, in one of the deepest mine sites in the UK. The project investigates how scientific and medical operations would take place in the challenging environments of the moon and Mars.It is the first of a series of new laboratory facilities planned to study how humans might work\u2014and stay healthy\u2014during long space missions, a key requirement for ensuring mission continuity on other planets.The team is working in partnership with the Boulby Underground Laboratory, a 4,000m3 deep underground facility focused on particle physics, Earth sciences and astrobiology research, run by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (part of UK Research and Innovation) with the support of the Boulby Mine operators, ICL-UK.The Bio-SPHERE project is based in a 3,000m3 tunnel network adjacent to the Boulby Laboratory, which go through 250-million-year-old rock salt deposits, consisting of Permian evaporite layers left over from the Zechstein Sea. This geological environment, together with the deep subsurface location, have enabled researchers to recreate the operational conditions humans would experience working in similar caverns on the moon and Mars. This includes remoteness, limited access to new materials and challenges in moving heavy equipment around.At the same time, thanks to the ultra-low radiation environment provided by that depth, the location will enable scientists to investigate how effective underground habitats might be in protecting space crews from deep-space radiation, which is a significant risk in space exploration, as well as other hazards, such as falling debris from meteorites, which risks damaging the life-support infrastructure.The first facility to be opened as part of Bio-SPHERE (Biomedical Sub-surface Pod for Habitability and Extreme-environments Research in Expeditions), is based in a 3-meter-wide simulation module and is designed specifically to test biomedical procedures needed to prepare materials for treating tissue damage. These include complex fluids, polymers and hydrogels for regenerative medicine that could be used, for example, in wound dressings, or fillers for damage mitigation.      A paper describing the concept and design of such a habitat was recently published in npj Microgravity.Bio-SPHERE, which includes a range of capabilities for sterile work and material processing, combines these simulation facilities and useful geological environment with access to the adjacent physics and chemistry laboratory facilities.This environment provides the opportunity to simulate various mission scenarios and to conduct cutting edge, interdisciplinary science, ranging from the effects of extreme environments on biological and physicochemical parameters and on medical infrastructure, all the way to investigating how available 'in-situ' resources such as ambient pressure, temperature and geology can be used for habitat construction.Lead researcher Dr. Alexandra Iordachescu, in the University of Birmingham's School of Chemical Engineering, said, \"We are excited to be partnering with the fantastic science team at the Boulby Underground Laboratory. This new capability will help to gather information that can advise on the life support systems, devices and biomaterials which could be used in medical emergencies and tissue repair following damage in deep-space missions.\"\"These types of metrics can guide system design and help to assess the scientific needs and acceptable timeframes in bioengineering operations under the constraints of isolated environments, such as space habitats. The data is likely to bring numerous benefits for Earth-based applications as well, such as delivering biomedical interventions in remote areas or in hazardous environments and more generally, understanding biomedical workflows in these non-ideal environments.\"Professor Sean Paling, Director and Senior Scientist at the Boulby Underground laboratory said, \"We are very pleased to be working with Dr. Iordachescu and the team from the University of Birmingham on this exciting work. The challenges ahead for humankind in exploring habitats beyond Earth are clearly many and significant.\"\"The Bio-SPHERE project promises to help answer some key logistical questions in establishing sustainable living conditions in remote, subterranean environments and in doing so will significantly contribute to the essential preparations for our collective long, difficult and exciting journey ahead. It is also a great example of the diverse range of science studies that can be carried out in a deep underground science facility, and we are very happy to be hosting it.\" More information:Alexandra Iordachescu et al, Space habitats for bioengineering and surgical repair: addressing the requirement for reconstructive and research tissues during deep-space missions, npj Microgravity (2023).

  "text": "Astronomers using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope have come up with what they say is some of their best evidence yet for the presence of a rare class of intermediate-sized black holes, having found a strong candidate lurking at the heart of the closest globular star cluster to Earth, located 6,000 light-years away.          Like intense gravitational potholes in the fabric of space, virtually all black holes seem to come in two sizes: small and humongous. It's estimated that our galaxy is littered with 100 million small black holes (several times the mass of our sun) created from exploded stars. The universe at large is flooded with supermassive black holes, weighing millions or billions of times our sun's mass and found in the centers of galaxies.A long-sought missing link is an intermediate-mass black hole, weighing roughly 100 to 100,000 times our sun's mass. How would they form, where would they hang out, and why do they seem to be so rare?Astronomers have identified other possible intermediate-mass black holes using a variety of observational techniques. Two of the best candidates\u20143XMM J215022.4-055108, which Hubble helped discover in 2020, and HLX-1, identified in 2009\u2014reside in the outskirts of other galaxies. Each of these possible black holes has the mass of tens of thousands of suns, and may have once been at the centers of dwarf galaxies.Looking much closer to home, there have been a number of suspected intermediate-mass black holes detected in dense globular star clusters orbiting our Milky Way galaxy. For example, in 2008, Hubble astronomers announced the suspected presence of an intermediate-mass black hole in the globular cluster Omega Centauri. For a number of reasons, including the need for more data, these and other intermediate-mass black hole findings still remain inconclusive and do not rule out alternative theories.Hubble's unique capabilities have now been used to zero-in on the core of the globular star cluster Messier 4 (M4) to go black-hole hunting with higher precision than in previous searches. \"You can't do this kind of science without Hubble,\" said Eduardo Vitral of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, and formerly of the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris (IAP, Sorbonne University) in Paris, France, lead author on a paper published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.      Vitral's team has detected a possible intermediate-mass black hole of roughly 800 solar masses. The suspected object can't be seen, but its mass is calculated by studying the motion of stars caught in its gravitational field, like bees swarming around a hive. Measuring their motion takes time, and a lot of precision. This is where Hubble accomplishes what no other present-day telescope can do. Astronomers looked at 12 years' worth of M4 observations from Hubble, and resolved pinpoint stars.ESA's Gaia spacecraft also contributed to this result with scans of over 6000 stars that constrained the global shape of the cluster and its mass. Hubble's data tend to rule out alternative theories for this object, such as a compact central cluster of unresolved stellar remnants like neutron stars, or smaller black holes swirling around each other.\"Using the latest Gaia and Hubble data, it was not possible to distinguish between a dark population of stellar remnants and a single larger point-like source,\" says Vitral. \"So one of the possible theories is that rather than being lots of separate small dark objects, this dark mass could be one medium-sized black hole.\"\"We have good confidence that we have a very tiny region with a lot of concentrated mass. It's about three times smaller than the densest dark mass that we had found before in other globular clusters,\" he continued. \"The region is more compact than what we can reproduce with numerical simulations when we take into account a collection of black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs segregated at the cluster's center. They are not able to form such a compact concentration of mass.\"A grouping of close-knit objects would be dynamically unstable. If the object isn't a single intermediate-mass black hole, it would require an estimated 40 smaller black holes crammed into a space only one-tenth of a light-year across to produce the observed stellar motions. The consequences are that they would merge and/or be ejected in a game of interstellar pinball.\"We measure the motions of stars and their positions, and we apply physical models that try to reproduce these motions. We end up with a measurement of a dark mass extension in the cluster's center,\" said Vitral. \"The closer to the central mass, the more randomly the stars are moving. And, the greater the central mass, the faster these stellar velocities.\"Because intermediate-mass black holes in globular clusters have been so elusive, Vitral cautions, \"While we cannot completely affirm that it is a central point of gravity, we can show that it is very small. It's too tiny for us to be able to explain other than it being a single black hole. Alternatively, there might be a stellar mechanism we simply don't know about, at least within current physics.\"\"Science is rarely about discovering something new in a single moment. It's about becoming more certain of a conclusion step by step, and this could be one step towards being sure that intermediate-mass black holes exist,\" explains Gaia mission scientist Timo Prusti. \"Data from Gaia Data Release 3 on the proper motion of stars in the Milky Way were essential in this study. Future Gaia Data Releases, as well as follow-up studies from the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes could shed further light.\" More information:Eduardo Vitral et al, An elusive dark central mass in the globular cluster M4, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (2023).

  "text": "By analyzing the data from ESA's Gaia satellite and from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), Indian astronomers have investigated a galactic open cluster known as NGC 5288. Results of the study, published May 17 on the arXiv preprint server, yield important information regarding the properties of this cluster.          Open clusters (OCs), formed from the same giant molecular cloud, are groups of stars loosely gravitationally bound to one another. So far, more than 1,000 of them have been discovered in the Milky Way, and scientists are still looking for more, hoping to find a variety of these stellar groupings. Expanding the list of known galactic open clusters and studying them in detail could be crucial for improving our understanding of the formation and evolution of our galaxy.Located some 7,000 light years away in the constellation Circinus, NGC 5288 (also known as Cr 278) is a galactic OC discovered in 1835. It is a rich, strongly absorbed cluster with a small but bright nucleus and a low-density extended corona. Although NGC 5288 has been known for nearly two centuries, it is a poorly studied cluster and there are still many discrepancies regarding its fundamental parameters.Therefore, in order to shed more light on its properties, a team of astronomers led by Ritika Sethi of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Berhampur, India, decided to inspect this cluster. \"We have investigated a poorly studied open cluster, NGC 5288, using 2MASS and Gaia DR3 photometric and astrometric database,\" the researchers wrote in the paper.The data allowed the team to calculate the membership probabilities of stars in the field of NGC 5288 and to identify 304 cluster members with membership probability greater than 50%. Furthermore, the astronomers estimated the fundamental properties of the cluster, investigated its structure, conducted a dynamical study and derived its galactic orbit and orbital parameters.The study found that NGC 5288 is approximately 510 million years old and is located some 9,000 light years away, therefore farther than previously estimated. The mean proper motions of cluster members in right ascension and declination were calculated to be \u22123.84 and \u22121.934 mas per year, respectively. The interstellar reddening of NGC 5288 was estimated to be at a level of 0.45.When it comes to the size of NGC 5288, the astronomers found that the core radius and the cluster radius are approximately 1.36 and 5.5 arcmins, respectively. The mass function slope for the cluster was found to be 1.39 for main-sequence (MS) stars (within the mass range 1.0\u20132.7 solar masses). The results also indicate that NGC 5288 is dynamically relaxed.The researchers also integrated the orbits of the cluster for a time duration equal to the cluster's age. As a result, they found that NGC 5288 is born near the galactic disk and moves in a circular orbit with a very small scale height.

  "text": "An international research team led by Professor Long Xiao from the School of Earth Sciences of China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) has discovered the presence of marine sedimentary rocks on the surface of Mars for the first time by comprehensively analyzing the scientific data obtained by the multispectral camera (MSCam) carried by the Zhurong rover. The relevant research results were published in the journal National Science Review under the title \"Evidence for Marine Sedimentary Rocks in Utopia Planitia: Zhurong Rover Observations.\"          Currently Mars is cold and dry, lacking water and traces of life, but the Martian environment billions of years ago may have been very different. Past studies have proven that there was a large amount of liquid water on Mars in the early days, and the paleo-ocean hypothesis was proposed through landform analysis of satellite images and numerical simulation.It has been proposed that the paleo-ocean area in the northern lowlands formed a special marine sedimentary geological unit, called the Vasitas Borealis Formation (VBF), but this proposition has lacked the support of in-situ data. Therefore, whether there was an ocean in the northern plain of Mars has been the focus of controversy for decades.In 2021, the Zhurong rover carried by China's Tianwen-1 Mars mission successfully landed on the southern edge of the Utopia Plain in the eastern part of the northern plain of Mars. Part of the mission was to search for any possible evidence for or against the existence of an ancient ocean, which may have hosted early life on Mars.                The base map of a is HiRIC (HX1_GRAS_HIRIC_DIM_0.7_0004_251515N1095850E_A), b is HiRISE DEM (DTEEC_069665_2055_069731_2055) overlain on the HiRIC. The elevation difference from the landing site to the break point (Sol_344) is about 5 meters. Credit: Science China Press             After landing, the Zhurong rover headed south towards potential coastline areas, observing the exposed Vasitas Borealis Formation along the way. Zhurong traveled about 1,921 meters, and used different imaging and analysis systems to conduct detailed in-situ observations of outcrops and surface rocks. The navigation and terrain cameras obtained 106 sets of panoramic images, which recorded in detail the surface morphology and structural characteristics of many rocks near the route of the Zhurong rover.The research team examined the photos sent back by the rover's on-board camera and found that the exposed rocks featured bedding structures, which are significantly different from the common volcanic rocks on the surface of Mars, and also different from the bedding structures formed by aeolian sand deposition. The structures indicated bidirectional flow characteristics consistent with low-energy tidal currents in Earth's littoral-shallow marine environment.Based on the rock images obtained by MSCam, the research team analyzed in detail the surface structure of the rocks in the inspection area of the Zhurong rover. Since the observed rocks are all located in the Zhurong inspection area, the research team named the geological unit it represents the Zhurong Member. During the study, the research team found that the rocks in the section typically retained local lens-shaped cross-bedding fabrics, mainly composed of a variety of small-scale cross-bedding, accompanied by a small amount of lens-shaped flaser bedding and sedimentary structures of small channel structures.                Block diagrams show interpreted sedimentary structures. The boulder is about 110 cm across and preserves a series of left-dipping planar surfaces separating 2-10 cm thick tabular units interpreted to be primary sedimentary bedding and is generally consistent with that on the surrounding ground. The greenish tint on some surfaces is due to color saturation of the sensors, and not real. The beds have internal laminations that differ from bed to bed. These features are used to interpret the primary depositional environment. Note that the boulder is locally sculpted by wind, in places covered by wind-blown dust or sand, and possibly affected by chemical weathering or cementation. a''.

In addition, since the thickness and grain size of the strata are largely different in different directions, it indicates that there are differences in the intensity of paleocurrents in the two directions.This bidirectional water flow pattern is usually formed by the fluid action with periodic flow direction changes, which is not common in eolian and fluvial environments, but is common in the littoral-shallow sea environment of Earth. Compared with Earth, Mars has only two small satellites, which makes its surface have a low-energy tidal system, and only small-scale bedding structures can be formed in this tidal environment.In addition, the bedforms and sedimentary structures identified in the study include evidence supporting aqueous flow rather than eolian deposition.

After that, ocean regression may have resulted in a shallow marine environment near the current position of the Zhurong rover (c, red arrow). Credit: Science China Press             The team's observational results of the Zhurong Member rocks in this study are the first direct in-situ evidence detected to support the existence of ancient oceans in the northern plains of Mars. The location of the landing site of Zhurong indicates that the observed sedimentary structures may have formed during the regression of the northern plain paleo-ocean.The sedimentary structures found in the Vasitas Borealis Formation provide new insights into the early history of Mars. The in-depth exploration by Zhurong in this area and future sample return will deepen our understanding of the habitability of Mars and the preservation of microbial life traces.

  "answer_race": " Axiom Space's private space station is on the way",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the company that is attempting to build its own space station?",
  "answer_squad": " Axiom Space",
  "text": "Axiom Space made history in 2022 with the first all-private mission to the International Space Station. The company is ready to do it again, but with more focus on its endgame: having its own commercial space station in what could potentially be a crowded playing field in low-Earth orbit.          \"The goals of these missions, which we sometimes call precursor missions, are to build up first the Axiom internal operations capability\u2014the tools, the processes\u2014to train flight controllers that are going to be required down the line to operate our Axiom Station in the future,\" said Axiom Space's Derek Hassmann, chief of mission integration and operations.The Axiom Mission 2 (Ax-2) flight is slated to send a crew of four to the International Space Station inside SpaceX's Crew Dragon Freedom atop a Falcon 9 rocket from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Pad 39-A.Liftoff is targeted for Sunday at 5:37 p.m. with a lone backup opportunity on Monday at 5:14 p.m.Space Launch Delta 45's weather squadron forecasts only a 60% chance for good conditions with worse weather predicted for Monday. Because of a busy schedule at the ISS as well as competing uses for the KSC launch pad, if the rocket can't go up in this window, the mission could see a delay into at least August.If it does launch, SpaceX will attempt recovery of the first-stage booster back at nearby Cape Canaveral Space Force Station's Landing Zone 1, a first for one of its crewed flights, and will bring the signature sonic boom to the Space Coast as it comes in for a touchdown.The crew features former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson as commander, becoming the first woman to command a private space mission.Now Axiom Space's Director of Human Spaceflight, she has flown on both the space shuttle and Russian Soyuz spacecraft and holds the American record having already spent 665 days in space. This flight, if it stays on schedule, would tack on about 10 more days, eight of which would be spent on board the ISS beginning with a planned docking Monday at 9:30 a.m.Along for the ride is private customer and aviator John Shoffner who will act as pilot. He and Whitson were the backup crew for the Ax-1 mission. The two remaining seats go to a pair of Saudi Space Commission astronauts, Rayyanah Barnawi and Ali AlQarni.      Barnawi will become the first Saudi woman in space and the pair will be the first Saudis to visit the ISS.\"Once they get their space legs under them, I know these guys are going to be extremely competent and I'm really looking forward to watching them perform,\" Whitson said. \"I have no questions or concerns about either the integration of our crew or their capabilities. I think we are ready to go.\"Unlike Ax-1, the crew is a mix of private and government customers, a shift in Axiom Space's business plan that it intends to pursue even more with upcoming flights to the ISS. The Ax-3 mission has already been approved by NASA and could come before the end of the year.The three private customers who flew on Ax-1 paid $55 million each to Axiom Space for what ended up being about two weeks in space. Axiom in turn has to pay SpaceX and NASA for the travel and accommodations for these missions.The fees paid by the Ax-2 or future customers, though, has not been revealed.The plan is for Axiom Space to construct its own living and working space in modules attached to the ISS, the first of which is expected in late 2025. Until then, NASA looks each year to support up to two private missions, open to Axiom or its competitors. Each opportunity to visit will make Axiom's space station plans run smoother, Hassmann said.\"It builds working relationships with NASA and with SpaceX so that when we eventually get to the point where we launch our first module, we'll have a solid capability in place that's based on these precursor missions that we've executed,\" he said.A second module will greatly expand Axiom's flexibility with space for up to eight crew and its own two docking ports. A third research and science module will join by 2027. Axiom recently announced that it would refurbish what NASA used to cart cargo to and from the ISS during the Space Shuttle Program.Nicknamed Raffaello, it's one of three Multi-Purpose Logistics Modules NASA built, but has been in storage at KSC since its last flight on Space Shuttle Atlantis in 2011.Axiom's plan will be to detach its three modules from the ISS and marry them to its own power and life-support system to become Axiom Station by 2029, one year ahead of the ISS's planned retirement.Axiom, though, isn't the only private space station expected to be orbiting Earth this decade. NASA has awarded three contracts for groups to pursue their own standalone space stations: Starlab from Lockheed Martin, Nanoracks and Voyager Space; Orbital Reef from Blue Origin, Sierra Space, Boeing and others; and one from Northrop Grumman\u2014but none likely would be in business until 2027 at the earliest.\"There are also a number of other private companies that are working toward commercial destinations, some who have reached out to NASA, some that are off working on their own,\" said Angela Hart, manager of NASA's Commercial Low Earth Orbit Development Program.That includes Long Beach, California-based startup Vast, which last week with SpaceX announced plans to get its own relatively small space station in orbit as early as August 2025. The single module could be flown on a Falcon 9 with plans for a Crew Dragon spacecraft to bring its first four passengers soon after, the company stated.Hart said NASA's goal is to award service contracts for a commercial low-Earth orbit destination in 2026, setting up the option to fly astronauts to that space station before 2030.\"Lots of folks are working things even sooner than that, which is great,\" she said. \"We'd love to see things up there earlier that we can see time on orbit, and lots of lessons that they'll learn as well, as we will just like we are here on these [private astronaut missions]. So it's going to be a very exciting next couple of years as we move in that direction.\"    2023 Orlando Sentinel. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "text": "NASA astronaut Victor Glover Jr. will travel farther into space than any Black person before him when he pilots the Artemis II lunar mission in 2024.          But he's already embarked on a personal mission that hits closer to home on Earth.He wants to take his fellow Americans to school and guide them deep into the nation's psyche, to help them reflect on the paradox of a nation that has a track record of oppressing Black people sending him on a trailblazing trip around the moon.Because of that legacy of racism, Glover says it's his duty to impress upon people that his voyage will represent more than a scientific triumph.During a conversation over Zoom about the beauty of space flight and the contradictions of American life, the 47-year-old Pomona, California, native says he recommends to audiences at his public speeches and his co-workers at NASA a choice set of reading, listening and viewing materials.He starts with the U.S. Constitution, whose words resound with the false promise of equality that has led to so much racial upheaval.\"I like to highlight Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3, the part that says all people are accounted for the purposes of taxation and representation but everybody else is considered 3/5 of the person\u2014remember, that's still in there,\" Glover says of the language referring to enslaved Africans.\"I encourage them to read the 'Letter from a Birmingham Jail' by Martin Luther King, the 'Paranoid Style in American Politics' by Richard Hofstadter,\" he says.\"And then there are movies and music: '13th,' about the 13th Amendment by Ava DuVernay, the Lupe Fiasco song 'Shoes' that's about Amaud Arbery, who was murdered because he was out jogging and getting some exercise.\"Glover flashes a broad smile while discussing his work. He looks every bit the proud national hero with his smooth-shaven face and royal blue NASA jumpsuit. The Artemis II program will set the stage for humans to venture to Mars\u2014a feat for the ages.But he turns introspective when speaking about his own existence. Here he is preparing to pilot a spaceship that will also carry the first woman\u2014Christina Hammock Koch\u2014to the moon, feeling tugged by the pull of American history.He understands that to be Black in America\u2014especially in an esteemed position like his\u2014requires constantly holding yourself up as a positive example to give hope to your people.      During his time as the first Black astronaut to live long-term aboard the International Space Station in 2021, he celebrated Black history month with a phone call from Vice President Kamala Harris, a transformative figure in her own right as the first woman of color to hold that office.\"The exciting thing about being a first is that there is a prospect of there being a second, a third and a fourth, and it actually becoming normal,\" Glover says. \"I really look forward to the point where it's not remarkable that a Black man is exploring the solar system\u2014or running this country.\"When celebrating Black excellence, Glover knows his joys are never his own, though. Neither are his sorrows.With every act of injustice, he thinks: \"It could've been me.\" That's what he wanted his white friends and colleagues to take to heart after a white police officer killed George Floyd in 2020, and they asked him: \"What can I do?\"Only a few months earlier, a white father and son gunned down Arbery in a racially motivated shooting.\"I think about him every time I'm out running,\" Glover says.Every instance of anti-Blackness strikes a chord deep within the whole community. That's why Glover believes it's essential for him to act as a kind of truth teller of the Black experience. It's fundamentally different for someone who looks like him\u2014who has both that promise of equality and America's frequent failure to deliver on it in his DNA\u2014to journey into space.\"It's important for us to live up to the words in some of our foundational documents\u2014of the people, by the people,\" Glover says. \"We're exploring for all people, and now we can say we're exploring with, or by, all people.\"Glover realizes that not everyone will share in the excitement over his lunar mission or revel in its symbolism. Black Americans have had a complicated outlook on space exploration. It has been seen as a source of inspiration and a distraction.Black people were still fighting for the right to freely vote, eat and sleep wherever they wanted and attend integrated schools when President Kennedy vowed in 1962 to land the first human on the moon.Many Black activists decried the massive spending dedicated to an Apollo lunar program that in the end would send only white men to Earth's sole natural satellite. Poverty, racial strife and police violence were crippling Black communities.That resentment cuts through Gil Scott-Heron's 1970 spoken-word piece, \"Whitey on the Moon,\" a favorite work that Glover recommends to his NASA colleagues: \"The man jus' upped my rent las' night. ('cause Whitey's on the moon) No hot water, no toilets, no lights. (but Whitey's on the moon).\"One of my first speeches was to my colleagues to tell them, 'Hey, remember who you're talking to\u2014little me, when I was a kid, I didn't feel connected to this,'\" Glover says. He got personal with his peers, he says, \"to help them broaden their understanding of what America is.\"\"We need to understand that perspective.\"At the same time, Black Americans have long embraced the power of the cosmos to liberate the spirit \u2014transforming the empty expanse of space into fertile territory brimming with new possibilities and luminous futures.\"You're a shining star/ No matter who you are/ Shining bright to see/ What you could truly be,\" sang Earth, Wind & Fire.Jimi Hendrix daydreamed about space while growing up in the Seattle area and took on the persona of a righteous alien in the prelude to his 1967 song, \"Up from the Skies.\"Some civil rights leaders of the 1960s understood the power of space to unlock the potential of the Black community, Glover says.\"I'm not sure if many people know, but Nichelle Nichols, Lt. Uhura from 'Star Trek,' there's a story that she was considering leaving the show,\" he says of the pioneering Black actress, who died in 2022 and whose ashes will be sent into space on United Launch Alliance's privately owned Vulcan rocket.\"Martin Luther King convinced her to stay because of what she represented and who she represented.\"\"She became one of biggest advocates for racial and gender diversity in NASA,\" Glover says.Realizing that so many since that era have sacrificed and shattered racial barriers\u2014including 14 other Black astronauts\u2014Glover says it's even more gratifying to pilot the first crewed U.S. lunar mission in half a century.\"I'm the fruit of the labor\u2014and the seed for the next generation as well,\" he says.As Glover shoots past Earth's atmosphere and sails 238,900 miles to the moon, his body will become weightless. But he knows his soul will be heavy.    2023 Los Angeles Times. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "text": "The first instrument to directly measure gravity on the surface of an asteroid has undergone testing in ESA's Mechanical Systems Laboratory.          The GRASS gravimeter will be landed on the surface of the Dimorphos asteroid aboard the Juventas CubeSat\u2014which will itself be deployed from ESA's Hera mission for planetary defense\u2014and is designed to measure an expected gravity level of less than a millionth of Earth's own.The Gravimeter for Small Solar System Objects, GRASS, has been developed by the Royal Observatory of Belgium (ROB) with Spain's EMXYS company.To prove it was ready for integration with Hera's Juventas CubeSat, GRASS was subjected to spacelike vacuum and temperature extremes within a thermal vacuum chamber, then underwent sustained shaking to mimic the violence of a rocket launch.\"It may be small but GRASS is packed with complex mechanical parts and electronics,\" explains Jose Carrasco, overseeing the instruments at EMXYS. \"We're very happy with its endurance during the test campaign. We will now follow up with a full integrity test to ensure it has sustained no damage during the testing, after which it will be passed to the GomSpace company in Luxembourg for integration aboard Juventas.\"The L-shaped instrument, the size of two smartphones stuck together, is designed to measure miniscule gravity levels because the Dimorphos asteroid it will touch down on is the smallest planetary object ever to be visited by a spacecraft. At around 160 m in diameter it is about the same size as Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza.                This image from ASI\u2019s LICIACube show the plumes of ejecta streaming from the Dimorphos asteroid after NASA\u2019s Double Asteroid Redirect Test, or DART, mission, made impact with it on 26 September 2022. Each rectangle represents a different level of contrast in order to better see fine structure in the plumes. By studying these streams of material, we will be able to learn more about the asteroid and the impact process. Credit: ASI/NASA/APL             Dimorphos became famous last year when it was impacted by NASA's DART spacecraft, sending out plumes of debris thousands of kilometers across space and measurably shifting its orbit around the larger Didymos asteroid.\"ESA's Hera mission is Europe's contribution to an international experiment in planetary defense,\" explains Hera system engineer Hannah Goldberg. \"Following the DART impact, Hera will gather close-up data on the Dimorphos asteroid to turn this kinetic impact experiment into a well-understood and in principle repeatable method of planetary defense. GRASS's surface gravity measurements will help researchers learn the precise mass of the asteroid, along with radio science experiments performed by the main Hera spacecraft.\"      The GRASS gravimeter design involves two sets of thin blades which are anchored within cradles, both of which are continuously rotating. The slightest motion of each blade changes the overall voltage of the blade itself and its surrounding walls. This capacitance-based measuring technique gives the gravimeter a sensitivity equivalent of a single micrometer\u2014or thousandth of a millimeter.\u00d6zg\u00fcr Karatekin of ROB adds, \"Obviously the real-world performance of the gravimeter cannot be demonstrated directly here on Earth, but our lab testing coupled with numerical simulations showed we have achieved sufficiently high sensitivity to detect such low gravity.\"The GRASS team also had to design an instrument small enough to fit into the Juventas CubeSat, itself only the size of a shoebox, along with Juventas' main radar instrument. In the event their final design is just 330 grams in mass and requires only half a watt of power.Jose Carrasco notes, \"The Royal Observatory of Belgium contributed the mechanical design, including the two blades, cradles and rotating motors, while EMXYS had to put together sufficiently compact electronics to operate the instrument, including copious use of commercial off the shelf parts.\"Credit: ESA/Science OfficeGRASS will be turned on as Juventas gradually falls to the surface of Dimorphos following the conclusion of its subsurface radar imaging campaign. The gravimeter will record the impact on the asteroid, any subsequent bounces and then any shifts in surface gravity over time, due to the influence of its parent Didymos asteroid.\u00d6zg\u00fcr Karatekin explains, \"We have to assume that Juventas could land at any angle on Dimorphos, so that potentially its solar arrays will be blocked from generating any further power. Instead GRASS will run on Juventas's internal battery for up to 20 hours.\"In addition, because the instrument's two gravimeters are positioned at right angles from each other, and go on rotating, the instrument can construct the 3D gravity vector and monitor its variations from any landing position.\"Once integrated within Juventas, GRASS will subsequently be tested as part of the overall nanosatellite.Based at ESA's ESTEC technical center in the Netherlands, the Mechanical Systems Lab is equipped for environmental testing of instruments, subsystems or entire small spacecraft. It is one of a suite of about 35 ESTEC labs, tasked with investigating every aspect of the space environment.

  "text": "Astronomers using the most powerful telescope ever built have identified a massive, densely packed galaxy 25 billion light years away.          The galaxy\u2014known as GS-9209\u2014formed just 600 to 800 million years after the Big Bang, and is the earliest of its kind found to date, researchers say.A team led by Edinburgh researchers has used the James Webb Space Telescope to reveal in detail the properties of GS-9209 for the first time.Star-studded galaxyDespite being around 10 times smaller than the Milky Way, GS-9209 has a similar number of stars to our own galaxy.These have a combined mass around 40 billion times that of our Sun, and were formed rapidly before star formation in GS-9209 stopped, the team says.GS-9209 is the earliest known example of a galaxy no longer forming stars\u2014known as a quiescent galaxy. When the team observed it at 1.25 billion years after the Big Bang, no stars had formed in the galaxy for about half a billion years.Shutdown theoryAnalysis also shows that GS-9209 contains a supermassive black hole at its center that is five times larger than astronomers might anticipate in a galaxy with this number of stars. The discovery could explain why GS-9209 stopped forming new stars, the team says.The growth of supermassive black holes releases huge amounts of high-energy radiation, which can heat up and push gas out of galaxies. This could have caused star formation in GS-9209 to stop, as stars form when clouds of dust and gas particles inside galaxies collapse under their own weight.Galaxy discoveryGS-9209 was first discovered in 2004 by Edinburgh Ph.D. student Karina Caputi, who was supervised at the time by Professors Jim Dunlop and Ross McLure in the University's School of Physics and Astronomy. Caputi is now a Professor at the University of Groningen, Netherlands.\"The James Webb Space Telescope has already demonstrated that galaxies were growing larger and earlier than we ever suspected during the first billion years of cosmic history. This work gives us our first really detailed look at the properties of these early galaxies, charting in detail the history of GS-9209, which managed to form as many stars as our own Milky Way in just 800 million years after the Big Bang.

  "text": "The densely packed globular cluster NGC 6325 glistens in this image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. This concentrated group of stars lies around 26,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Ophiuchus.       Globular clusters like NGC 6325 are tightly bound collections of stars with anywhere from tens of thousands to millions of members. They can be found in all types of galaxies and act as natural laboratories for astronomers studying star formation. This is because the constituent stars of globular clusters tend to form at roughly the same time and with similar initial composition, meaning astronomers can use them to fine-tune their theories of how stars evolve.Astronomers inspected this particular cluster not to understand star formation, but to search for a hidden monster. Though it might look peaceful, astronomers suspect this cluster could contain an intermediate-mass black hole that is subtly affecting the motion of surrounding stars. Previous research found that the distribution of stars in some highly concentrated globular clusters\u2014those with stars packed relatively tightly together\u2014was slightly different from what astronomers expected.This discrepancy suggests that at least some of these densely packed globular clusters\u2014including perhaps NGC 6325\u2014could have a black hole lurking at the center. To explore this hypothesis further, astronomers turned to Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 to observe a larger sample of densely populated globular clusters, which included this star-studded image of NGC 6325. Additional data from Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys was also incorporated into this image.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards the new design?",
  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the telescope that would replace the Arecibo Telescope?",
  "answer_squad": " Next Generation Arecibo Telescope",
  "text": "The Arecibo Telescope was an amazing tool for astronomers. Built in the early 1960s, it had a 1,000-foot-wide dish and was capable of both receiving and transmitting radio signals. It did radar mapping of near-Earth asteroids, Venus, and the moon, discovered water at the polar regions of Mercury, searched for alien civilizations, and even send a radio message from Earth to a globular cluster 25,000 light years away. So when it collapsed in 2020, many astronomers wondered if it could be rebuilt.          Even ignoring the funding challenges to a rebuilding project, a true rebuilding of the Arecibo Telescope is unlikely. At the time of its construction, it was the most sensitive radio telescope ever, but in the past sixty years radio technology has advanced considerably. Even during its operation, Arecibo had some limitations. For example, it wasn't truly steerable, meaning that its coverage of the sky was limited. And as a single-dish telescope, it wasn't as adaptable as modern array telescopes. But Arecibo was also very good at radar astronomy, which other telescopes are not, so it filled an observational niche.There are several proposals to replace the Arecibo telescope with a modern observatory. One recent proposal has introduced a design that is in many ways a compromise plan. It tries to maintain many of the advantages of a large single dish while introducing a more flexible design similar to an array telescope. They call it the Next Generation Arecibo Telescope. The study is published on the arXiv preprint server.One of the first things this design does is get rid of the single dish. While there are modern single-dish telescopes, such as the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), they are much larger than Arecibo's original 300-meter design. It isn't feasible to build an even larger single dish at the Arecibo location. So the team proposes an array of 102 13-meter dishes. In comparison, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has 54 12-meter dishes and a dozen 7-meter dishes. Rather than building them as movable dishes like ALMA, the team proposes arranging them in a fixed circular array 130 meters across. This would be less than half the diameter of the original Arecibo Telescope, but with more than a hundred receivers it would be far more sensitive.                The sensitivity range of the proposed NGAT-130. Credit: Roshi et al             By placing the dishes in such a configuration, the new design could function as a single dish. Most array telescopes gather data as individual dishes, then integrate the data through a process called correlation. This allows for an array to act as a single virtual dish but does so at some cost of sensitivity. Another way to combine data is called a phased array, which integrates the data as if the dishes were all at the same point. The phased array method loses resolution, but gains you significant sensitivity. As part of the Event Horizon Telescope, which made the first direct observations of black holes, ALMA was configured as a phased array to boost the overall sensitivity of the EHT. Through the phased array, this design would act as a highly sensitive single dish, which was one of the main strengths of the original Arecibo Telescope.      The array design would also allow Arecibo to be steerable. And it would be significantly lighter and easier to maintain than the original design. Estimates put its overall weight at about half that of the Green Bank Telescope, which has only a 100-meter diameter.It's an interesting design, but at this stage, there are several interesting designs being proposed. The process from initial idea to approved design to construction is long and arduous, to say nothing of the challenge of funding. It could be decades before a new telescope is built at Arecibo Observatory. But designs such as this show how astronomers leverage both the old and the new and find amazing ways to explore the universe more than ever before. More information:D.

  "answer_race": " Scientists Find Out Why Jupiter's Stripes Change",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the planet that is characterized by bands of color?",
  "answer_squad": " Jupiter",
  "text": "Academics at the University of Leeds believe they could have found the answer to a long-running mystery behind Jupiter's famous \"stripes.\"          Pictures of the planet are characterized by bands of color, as well as the famous Great Red Spot, but these bands are often seen to move and change\u2014something which scientists have until now not been able to explain.Now thanks to a new discovery\u2014made possible by NASA's Juno mission providing incredible new information about Jupiter's magnetic field\u2014Dr. Kumiko Hori and Professor Chris Jones from the University's School of Math believe they could have found the answer.Professor Jones said, \"If you look at Jupiter through a telescope, you see the stripes, which go round the equator along lines of latitude. There are dark and light belts that occur, and if you look a little bit more closely, you can see clouds zipping around carried by extraordinarily strong easterly and westerly winds. Near the equator, the wind blows eastward but as you change latitude a bit, either north or south, it goes westward. And then if you move a little bit further away it goes eastward again. This alternating pattern of eastward and westward winds is quite different from weather on Earth.\"\"Every four or five years, things change. The colors of the belts can change and sometimes you see global upheavals when the whole weather pattern goes slightly crazy for a bit, and it has been a mystery as to why that happens.\"Scientists already know the changing appearance of Jupiter is somehow linked to infrared variations about 50 km below the gas giant's surface, and this fresh research has shown that these variations could in turn be caused by waves produced by the planet's magnetic field, deep within its interior.Using data gathered by NASA's Juno mission to Jupiter, which has been orbiting the planet since 2016, their research team was able to monitor and calculate changes in its magnetic field.Professor Jones added, \"It is possible to get wavelike motions in a planetary magnetic field which are called torsional oscillations. The exciting thing is that when we calculated the periods of these torsional oscillations, they corresponded to the periods that you see in the infrared radiation on Jupiter.\"      The amazing longevity of Juno in the harsh radiation environment of Jupiter has seen the probe stay in orbit for much longer than originally planned. This has led to the Leeds researchers getting magnetic field data over a much longer period, which is much more useful to their work.By looking at the magnetic field over several years, they have been able to track its waves and oscillations and have even been able to follow a specific spot of magnetic field on Jupiter called the Great Blue Spot. This spot has been moving eastwards, but the latest data shows that movement is slowing\u2014leading the Juno team to believe this is the beginning of an oscillation, with the movement slowing before it reverses and starts going westwards.The work was led by Dr. Hori, who worked with Professor Jones at Leeds before moving to a new post at Kobe University in Japan, along with Professor Steve Tobias at Leeds, Professor Leigh Fletcher at the University of Leicester and Dr. Arrate Antu\u00f1ano at the Universidad del Pa\u00eds Vasco in Spain.It has seen them produce an explanation for the long-running mystery of Jupiter's changing bands and stripes and fill in the missing link between the two largest areas of Jupiter study\u2014scientists interested in the planet's weather and what happens on the surface, and those working on the deep interior.Dr. Hori said, \"There remain uncertainties and questions, particularly how exactly the torsional oscillation produces the observed infrared variation, which likely reflects the complex dynamics and cloud/aerosol reactions. Those need more research. Nonetheless, I hope our paper could also open a window to probe the hidden deep interior of Jupiter, just like seismology does for the Earth and helioseismology does for the sun.\"For Professor Jones, the breakthrough is the culmination of a lifelong passion for Jupiter. He said, \"I am incredibly pleased that NASA finally managed to get to see Jupiter's magnetic field in detail. I have been studying Jupiter for an exceptionally long time and I got interested in what lies below the surface of Jupiter when I was a child\u2014it has been a 60-year progression.\" More information:Kumiko Hori et al, Jupiter's cloud-level variability triggered by torsional oscillations in the interior, Nature Astronomy (2023).

  "question_squad": " What is the mass of CI Tau?",
  "answer_squad": " 0.9 solar masses",
  "text": "Using ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT), an international team of astronomers has probed the inner dusty ring of a young star known as CI Tauri (or CI Tau for short). Results of the study, published May 14 on the arXiv pre-print server, deliver important insights into the properties of this disk.          CI Tau is a classical T Tauri star located some 522.6 light years away in the Taurus molecular cloud. It is approximately two times larger than the sun, has a mass of about 0.9 solar masses and is estimated to be two million years old. Previous studies of CI Tau have found that it is orbited by at least one planet\u2014a hot super-Jupiter that is approximately 11.3 times more massive than Jupiter.Observations of CI Tau have also detected a circumstellar disk that extends up to 200 AU on millimeter continuum images, with gaps located at radii of 13, 39, and 100 AU from the star, suggestive of on-going planet formation. The star is still accreting material from a debris disk at an unsteady pace, possibly modulated by the eccentric orbital motion of its planet.A group of astronomers led by Anthony Soulain of the University of Grenoble in France, decided to observe the CI Tau system using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) in order to shed more light on the properties of the dusty inner disk.\"We aim at spatially and spectrally resolving the innermost scale (\u2264 1 au) of the young stellar system CI Tau to constrain the inner disk properties and better understand the magnetospheric accretion phenomenon,\" the researchers wrote in the paper.The observations identified a highly inclined resolved inner disk, whose inner edge is located at a distance of about 21 times the radius of CI Tau from the star. The measured inner rim position appears to be significantly farther than the theoretical sublimation radius. This, according to the astronomers, means that a close-in massive planetary companion may be present in the system.It was found that the inner disk of CI Tau showcases a strong misalignment relative to the outer disk seen at submillimeter wavelengths. The researchers suppose that such a misalignment could be induced by magnetic warping or by gravitational torques induced by a close-in massive companion.The results also allowed Soulain's team to shed more light on the magnetospheric accretion region of CI Tau. The size of the Brackett-gamma emitting region was found to be consistent with the magnetospheric accretion process. However, the size of this region turned out to be significantly smaller than the co-rotation radius. The authors of the paper concluded that this leads to an unstable accretion regime, presumably at the origin of the stochastic photometric variability of the system. More information:A.

Rayyanah Barnawi, a breast cancer researcher, is the first Saudi woman to voyage into space and is joined on the mission by fellow Saudi Ali Al-Qarni, a fighter pilot.The Axiom Mission 2 (Ax-2) crew took off aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral at 5:37 pm (2137 GMT).The team also includes Peggy Whitson, a former NASA astronaut, who will be making her fourth flight to the ISS, and John Shoffner, a businessman from Tennessee, who is piloting.\"Thanks for putting your trust in the Falcon 9 team,\" SpaceX chief engineer Bill Gerstenmaier told the crew minutes after lift-off.\"Hope you enjoyed the ride to space. Have a great trip on Dragon,\" he added, referring to the spacecraft.\"Welcome home to zero-g, Peggy.\"The crew is due to spend around 10 days on board the ISS, arriving around 9:25 am (1325 GMT) Monday.\"Being the first Saudi woman astronaut, representing the region, it's a great pleasure and honor that I'm very happy to carry,\" Barnawi said at a recent press conference.                Axiom Mission 2 specialist Rayyanah Barnawi (L) of Saudi Arabia and commander and former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, of the United States, make heart shapes with their hands towards relatives ahead of their launch to the International Space Station.             She added that, aside from the research she will carry out on board, she was looking forward to sharing her experience on the ISS with kids.\"Being able to see their faces when they see astronauts from their own region for the first time is very thrilling,\" she said.A career fighter pilot, Al-Qarni said he has \"always had the passion of exploring the unknown and just admiring the sky and the stars.\"\"It is a great opportunity for me to pursue this kind of passion that I have, and now maybe just fly among the stars.\"'Just the beginning'The mission is not Saudi Arabia's first foray into space.In 1985, Prince Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, an air force pilot, took part in a US-organized space voyage.\"I reflect on my experience in space many years ago, and I am happy that Saudi Arabia has returned to space once again,\" he told AFP at a watch party for the Ax-2 launch in Riyadh.\"God willing, this is just the beginning.\"                People wave flags at a viewing party in Riyadh on May 21, 2023 as a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Axiom Mission 2 astronauts prepares to lift off at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.             The space mission involving a Saudi woman is the latest move by the country, where women only gained the right to drive a few years ago, to revamp its ultraconservative image.The oil-rich Gulf kingdom established the Saudi Space Commission in 2018 and launched a program last year to send astronauts into space.Scores of flag-waving Saudis gathered at the launch party in Riyadh beneath a massive white tent for the blast-off countdown.Jawaher al-Sabhan, who came to the event with her 11-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter, said the moment gave her \"indescribable feelings.\"\"I love space and exploration in general, and I love my children knowing about space and the advantages of exploring it,\" she said.      ExperimentsThe four-member team is set to carry out about 20 experiments while on the ISS.One of them involves studying the behavior of stem cells in zero gravity.They will join seven others already aboard the ISS: three Russians, three Americans, and Emirati astronaut Sultan al-Neyadi, who last month became the first Arab national to go on a spacewalk.                Ax-2 crew members Peggy Whitson (far left), Rayyanah Barnawi, John Shoffner and Ali Al-Qarni took part in training ahead of their expected journey to the International Space Station.             Ax-2 is the second Axiom Space mission in partnership with ISS keyholder NASA.The private space company offers the voyages for sums that run into the millions of dollars.Axiom Space also oversees training for the astronauts, charters their means of transport, and manages their stay in space.The company carried out its first private mission to the ISS in April 2022, sending three businessmen and former astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria into orbit for 17 days as part of Ax-1.Private space stationsFor Axiom Space, these missions are a first step toward an ambitious goal: the construction of its own space station, with the first module expected to launch in 2025.The station would first be attached to the ISS before separating and orbiting independently.NASA plans to retire the ISS around 2030 and to instead send astronauts to private stations, which will also host their own clients, leading the US space agency to encourage the development of programs by several companies.Russia recently agreed to extend its use of the ISS until 2028, having threatened an earlier pullout last year as ties unraveled between the Kremlin and the West over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Private mission carrying Saudi astronauts launches to ISS (2023, May 22)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-private-mission-saudi-astronauts-iss-1.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "A private mission to the International Space Station (ISS) organized by Axiom Space is due to blast off from Florida on Sunday, carrying the first two Saudi astronauts to go to the orbiting laboratory.          Rayyanah Barnawi, a breast cancer researcher, will become the first Saudi woman to voyage into space and will be joined on the mission by fellow Saudi Ali Al-Qarni, a fighter pilot.The Axiom Mission 2 (Ax-2) crew will take off aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral in the southern state of Florida at 5:37 pm (2137 GMT).The team also includes Peggy Whitson, a former NASA astronaut who will be making her fourth flight to the ISS, and John Shoffner, a businessman from Tennessee who will serve as pilot.They are due to spend around 10 days on board the ISS, where they should arrive around 1:30 pm on Monday.\"Being the first Saudi woman astronaut, representing the region, it's a great pleasure and honor that I'm very happy to carry,\" said Barnawi at a recent press conference.She added that, aside from excitement for the research she will carry out on board, she is looking forward to sharing her experience with kids while on the ISS.\"Being able to see their faces when they see astronauts from their own region for the first time is very thrilling,\" she said.A career fighter pilot, Al-Qarni said he has \"always had the passion of exploring the unknown and just admiring the sky and the stars.\"\"It is a great opportunity for me to pursue this kind of passion that I have, and now maybe just fly among the stars.\"The mission is not Saudi Arabia's first foray into space.In 1985, Prince Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, an air force pilot, took part in a US-organized space voyage.But the space mission involving a Saudi woman is the latest move by the oil-rich Gulf kingdom, where women only gained the right to drive a few years ago, to revamp its ultraconservative image.The kingdom established the Saudi Space Commission in 2018 and launched a program last year to send astronauts into space.ExperimentsThe four-member team is set to carry out some 20 experiments while on the ISS.One of them involves studying the behavior of stem cells in zero gravity.They will join seven others already on board the ISS: three Russians, three Americans and Emirati astronaut Sultan al-Neyadi, who was the first Arab national to go on a spacewalk last month.The mission to the ISS will be the second in partnership with ISS-key holder NASA by Axiom Space, a private space company, which offers the rare voyages for sums that run into the millions of dollars.The company oversees training the astronauts, chartering their means of transport and ensuring the smooth management of their stay.Axiom Space carried out its first private astronaut mission to the ISS in April 2022, sending three businessmen and former astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria to spend 17 days in orbit as part of Ax-1.Some astronauts on the ISS at the time said they had to take time out of their day\u2014precious in zero gravity\u2014to take care of the space tourists.\"My time is actually a lot less constrained than Mike Lopez-Alegria's time was on the first mission,\" said Whitson. \"I'll be available to help the crew members a lot more as they need assistance.\"Private space stationsFor Axiom Space, these missions are a first step toward an ambitious goal: the construction of its own space station, with the first module expected to launch in 2025.The station would at first be attached to the ISS before separating and orbiting independently.NASA plans to retire the ISS around 2030 and to instead send astronauts to private stations, which will also host their own clients, leading the US space agency to encourage the development of programs by several companies.Russia recently agreed to extend its use of the ISS until 2028, having threatened an earlier pullout last year as ties unraveled between the Kremlin and the West over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.The other international partners\u2014Japan, Canada and the European Space Agency\u2014have committed themselves, like the United States, to continue operations until 2030.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Private mission carrying first Saudi astronauts to visit ISS set for launch (2023, May 21)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-private-mission-saudi-astronauts-iss.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the gas that is left behind when a star dies?",
  "answer_squad": " planetary nebulae",
  "text": "When stars like our sun die, they tend to go out with a whimper and not a bang\u2014unless they happen to be part of a binary (two) star system that could give rise to a supernova explosion.          Now, for the first time, astronomers have spotted the radio signature of just such an event in a galaxy more than 400 million light-years away. The finding, published May 17 in Nature, holds tantalizing clues as to what the companion star must have been like.An explosive star deathAs stars up to eight times heavier than our sun start to run out of nuclear fuel in their core, they puff off their outer layers. This process gives rise to the colorful clouds of gas misleadingly known as planetary nebulae, and leaves behind a dense, compact hot core known as a white dwarf.Our own sun will undergo this transition in 5 billion years or so, then slowly cool and fade away. However, if a white dwarf somehow puts on weight, a self-destruct mechanism kicks in when it gets heavier than about 1.4 times the mass of our sun. The subsequent thermonuclear detonation destroys the star in a distinctive kind of explosion called a Type Ia supernova.But where would the extra mass come from to fuel such a bang?We used to think it could be gas being stripped off a bigger companion star in a close orbit. But stars tend to be messy eaters, spilling gas everywhere. A supernova explosion would shock any spilt gas and make it glow at radio wavelengths. Despite decades of searching however, not a single young Type Ia supernova has ever been detected with radio telescopes.Instead, we began to think Type Ia supernovae must be pairs of white dwarfs spiraling inwards and merging together in a relatively clean fashion, leaving no gas to shock\u2014and no radio signal.                Credit: Adam Makarenko/W. M. Keck Observatory, Author provided             A rare type of supernovaSupernova 2020eyj was discovered by a telescope in Hawai'i on March 23, 2020. For the first seven weeks or so it behaved in much the same way as any other Type Ia supernova.But for the next five months, it stopped fading in brightness. Around the same time, it began to show features indicating gas that was unusually rich in helium. We began to suspect Supernova 2020eyj belonged to a rare subclass of Type Ia supernovae in which the blast wave, moving at more than 10,000 kilometers per second, sweeps past gas that could only have been stripped off the outer layers of a surviving companion star.To try to confirm our hunch, we decided to test if there was enough gas being shocked to produce a radio signal. As the supernova is too far north to observe with telescopes like the Australia Telescope Compact Array near Narrabri, we instead used an array of radio telescopes spread across the United Kingdom to observe the supernova about 20 months after the explosion.To our great surprise, we had the first-ever clear detection of an \"infant\" Type Ia supernova at radio wavelengths, confirmed by a second observation some five months later. Could this be the \"smoking gun\" that not all Type Ia supernovae are caused by the merger of two white dwarfs?Patience pays offOne of the more remarkable properties of Type Ia supernovae is that they all seem to reach pretty much the same peak brightness. This is consistent with them all having reached a similar critical mass before exploding.This very attribute allowed astronomer Brian Schmidt and colleagues to reach their Nobel Prize-winning conclusion in the late 1990s: that the universe's expansion since the Big Bang is not slowing down under gravity (as everyone had expected), but is accelerating due to the effects of what we now call dark energy.So, Type Ia supernovae are important cosmic objects, and the fact we still don't know exactly how and when these stellar explosions occur, or what makes them so consistent, has been a worry to astronomers.In particular, if pairs of merging white dwarfs can range in total mass up to almost three times the mass of our sun, why should they all release about the same amount of energy?Our hypothesis (and radio confirmation) that Supernova 2020eyj occurred when enough helium gas was stripped off the companion star and onto the surface of the white dwarf to push it just over the mass limit, provides a natural explanation for this consistency.The question now is why we haven't seen this radio signal before in any other Type Ia supernova. Perhaps we tried to detect them too soon after the explosion, and gave up too easily. Or maybe not all companion stars are as helium-rich and prodigious in shedding their gaseous outer layers.But as our study has shown, patience and persistence sometimes pays off in ways we never expected, allowing us to hear the dying whispers of a distant star.

  "question_squad": " Who founded Blue Origin?",
  "answer_squad": " Jeff Bezos",
  "text": "Two years after awarding Elon Musk's SpaceX a contract to ferry astronauts to the surface of the Moon, NASA on Friday announced it had chosen Blue Origin, a rival space company founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos, to build a second lunar lander.          Blue Origin's lander was selected for the Artemis 5 mission, currently scheduled to take place in 2029. The company will first have to demonstrate it can safely land on the Moon without a crew.Bezos, the founder and former CEO of Amazon, said on Twitter he was \"honored to be on this journey with @NASA to land astronauts on the Moon\u2014this time to stay.\"The contract amounts to $3.4 billion, but John Couluris, vice-president in charge of lunar transport at Blue Origin, said during a press conference that the company would itself contribute \"well north\" of that amount to develop the craft.The Artemis program marks NASA's return to the Moon after more than 50 years and is made up of several missions, each with increasing complexity.In 2021, the US agency chose SpaceX to build a lander for Artemis 3, the first mission in the series to have actual astronauts set foot on the lunar surface.The contract was worth $2.9 billion, although SpaceX is supplementing that amount with its own funding.Blue Origin had also competed for the first contract, and filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against NASA when SpaceX was chosen as the sole lander provider.The space agency had originally intended to offer two contracts, a practice commonly used to guard against the possibility one fails, but said it had been constrained by budget concerns.NASA in 2022 also chose the SpaceX lander for its Artemis 4 mission, but at the same time requested submissions from other companies for the rest of the program.\"We want more competition. We want two landers,\" NASA boss Bill Nelson said on Friday. \"It means that you have reliability. You have backups.\"Blue Origin's lander, dubbed Blue Moon, is being developed with several partner companies, including Draper, Boeing, Astrobotic, Honeybee Robotics, and Lockheed Martin.The latter will be responsible for developing a crucial element. Once in lunar orbit, Blue Moon will need to be refueled before it can descend and collect the astronauts from the surface of the Moon.Therefore Lockheed Martin has to develop a kind of shuttle to refuel Blue Moon around the Moon.Blue Origin plans to use its New Glenn rocket, which has never flown before, to launch both its lander and this refueling shuttle.Artemis 4, scheduled for 2028, and Artemis 5 a year later will both land on the Moon, but will first pass through a new space station in lunar orbit, called Gateway, which has yet to be constructed.Prelude to MarsArtemis astronauts will take off aboard NASA's Orion capsule, propelled to the Moon by the agency's new SLS mega-rocket.Both these elements were tested uncrewed when Artemis 1 took place six months ago, and will be tested with crew during Artemis 2.For Artemis 3, Orion will dock directly to SpaceX's lander. Two astronauts will then descend on the Moon for about a week, while two others will remain on board Orion.Once their experiments are over, the two adventurers will go back in the lander to Orion, which will bring the four crew members back to Earth.Afterwards, Orion will attach to the Gateway space station, and the astronauts will pass through it before boarding the SpaceX lander, for Artemis 4, or Blue Origin for Artemis 5.All of these missions target the south pole of the Moon, where there is water in the form of ice.SpaceX's lander will be a modified version of its Starship spacecraft, currently under development in Texas. It exploded in flight during a first major test in April.The goal of the Artemis program is to learn to live on the Moon, in order to test out all the technologies necessary for an even more perilous journey: to Mars.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:After SpaceX, NASA taps Bezos's Blue Origin to build Moon lander (2023, May 20)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-spacex-nasa-bezos-blue-moon.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "The National Science Foundation's (NSF) Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope released eight new images of the sun, previewing the exciting science underway at the world's most powerful ground-based solar telescope. The images feature a variety of sunspots and quiet regions of the sun obtained by the Visible-Broadband Imager (VBI), one of the telescope's first-generation instruments.       The Inouye Solar Telescope's unique ability to capture data in unprecedented detail will help solar scientists better understand the sun's magnetic field and drivers behind solar storms.The sunspots pictured are dark and cool regions on the sun's \"surface\", known as the photosphere, where strong magnetic fields persist. sunspots vary in size, but many are often the size of Earth, if not larger. Complex sunspots or groups of sunspots can be the source of explosive events like flares and coronal mass ejections that generate solar storms. These energetic and eruptive phenomena influence the outermost atmospheric layer of the sun, the heliosphere, with the potential to impact Earth and our critical infrastructure.                A light bridge is seen crossing a sunspot's umbra from one end of the penumbra to the other. Light bridges are believed to be the signature of the start of a decaying sunspot, which will eventually break apart. Light bridges are very complex, taking different forms and phases. It is unknown how deep these structures form. This image shows one example of a light bridge in remarkable detail.Umbra: Dark, central region of a sunspot where the magnetic field is strongest.Penumbra: The brighter, surrounding region of a sunspot's umbra characterized by bright filamentary structures. Credit: NSF/AURA/NSOImage Processing: Friedrich W\u00f6ger(NSO), Catherine Fischer (NSO), Tetsu Anan (NSO)             In the quiet regions of the sun, the images show convection cells in the photosphere displaying a bright pattern of hot, upward-flowing plasma (granules) surrounded by darker lanes of cooler, down-flowing solar plasma. In the atmospheric layer above the photosphere, called the chromosphere, we see dark, elongated fibrils originating from locations of small-scale magnetic field accumulations.The recently inaugurated telescope is in its Operations Commissioning Phase (OCP), a learning and transitioning period during which the observatory is slowly brought up to its full operational capabilities.The international science community was invited to participate in this phase through an Operations Commissioning Phase Proposal Call. In response to these calls, investigators submitted science proposals requesting telescope time for a specific and detailed science goal. In order to optimize for science return, while balancing the available observing time and the technical needs in this very early operational phase, the proposals were subsequently peer-reviewed by a proposal review committee and telescope time was granted by a Telescope Allocation Committee. The selected proposals were executed in 2022 during the Cycle 1 operations window.                A detailed example of a light bridge crossing a sunspot's umbra. In this picture, the presence of convection cells surrounding the sunspot is also evident. Hot solar material (plasma) rises in the bright centers of these surrounding \u201ccells,\u201d cools off, and then sinks below the surface in dark lanes in a process known as convection. The detailed image shows complex light bridge and convection cell structures on the Sun's surface or photosphere.Light bridge: A bright solar feature that spans across an umbra from one penumbra to the other.

The Inouye Solar Telescope's Data Center continues to calibrate and deliver data to the scientists and public.As the Inouye Solar Telescope continues to explore the sun, we expect more new and exciting results from the scientific community\u2014including spectacular views of our solar system's most influential celestial body.

The dazzling central region of this sprawling cloud reveals a pair of infant stars bursting from their natal cocoons of dust and gas to illuminate the reflection nebula known as Bernes 149. These contrasting regions make this object a prime target of research on star formation.          The clashing of energy and matter can lead to fantastical sites on Earth, such as glowing auroras and powerful lightning displays. The same can be said about space, where energy from bright young stars and protostars floods their surroundings, illuminating vast interstellar clouds of dust and gas to create spectacular objects known as reflection nebulae.One stunning example of these clashing forces is the star-forming interstellar cloud Lupus 3, captured here by the 570-megapixel US Department of Energy-fabricated Dark Energy Camera at NSF's NOIRLab's Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. This star-forming nebula is located about 500 light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Lupus (the Wolf).The two blue stars blazing in the center of the sprawling nebula, known as HR 5999 and HR 6000, illuminate nearby gas and dust, creating the bright blue reflection nebula Bernes 149. These stars grew out of the dark nebula Lupus 3, which stretches like a blanket across the background of stars. This cloud is not just a coal-black cosmic blob, however. It is home to a fleet of infant stars known as T Tauri stars, which will eventually use the material of Lupus 3 to grow into fully fledged stars.The massive, star-forming interstellar cloud Lupus 3 is captured with the 570-megapixel US Department of Energy-fabricated Dark Energy Camera at NSF's NOIRLab's Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.

Zamani & D. de Martin Music: Stellardrone - AirglowAt the relatively young age of about 1 million years, HR 5999 and HR 6000 are the oldest of the stars in the Lupus 3 region. These stars are pre-main-sequence stars, meaning that despite their brightness, they are not yet powered by nuclear fusion, like our sun. They are instead powered by gravity, which compresses and heats up the internal matter. These sibling stars have blown away nearby gas and dust, illuminating the remnants and creating the Bernes 149 reflection nebula.When the true nature of this nebula was first discovered, astronomers hoped that it and similar regions would be useful in finding areas of recent or active star formation. This hunch was proven correct and Lupus 3 has since provided many insights into the early stages of star formation.Lupus 3 is one of at least nine clouds within the massive Lupus cloud complex. Lupus 3 itself stretches across an area of the sky equivalent to about 24 moon-diameters as seen from Earth. With a whopping 2.2-degree field of view, DECcam can capture massive objects like Lupus 3 in a single image. The pairing of DECam's wide-field capabilities and the light-collecting capabilities of the V\u00edctor M. Blanco 4-meter Telescope's 4-meter-wide mirror produces crisp, high resolution images.

  "text": "Jeff Bezos' rocket company has won a NASA contract to land astronauts on the moon, two years after it lost out to SpaceX.          Blue Origin received a $3.4 billion contract Friday to lead a team to develop a lunar lander named Blue Moon. It will be used to transport astronauts to the lunar surface as early as 2029, following a pair of crew landings by Elon Musk's SpaceX.NASA will get astronauts to lunar orbit using its own rockets and capsules, but wants private companies to take over from there.NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said the agency wants different landing options as it seeks a return to the moon more than a half-century after the end of the Apollo moonshots.Blue Origin is kicking in billions of dollars, on top of the NASA contract, to help establish a permanent presence on the moon.\"We have a lot to do before we successfully land and return astronauts,\" said John Couluris, a Blue Origin vice president.Two years ago, Blue Origin sued after NASA awarded SpaceX the contract for the first lunar landing. A federal judge upheld the space agency's decision.NASA's Artemis program, which follows the 1960s and 1970s Apollo moonshots. kicked off with a successful test flight late last year. Launched atop NASA's new moon rocket, an empty Orion capsule went into lunar orbit before returning home.The next Artemis flight will come late next year when one Canadian and three U.S. astronauts fly to the moon and back, but not land. Two Americans would descend to the lunar surface aboard a SpaceX Starship on the mission after that, no earlier than late 2025.Like SpaceX, Blue Origin plans to practice landing on the moon without a crew, before putting astronauts on board.While the shiny, stainless steel Starship has a science fiction look, Blue Moon resembles more of a traditional capsule perched atop a tall compartment with legs. The latter will stand 52 feet (16 meters) on the moon.Both companies' landers are meant to be reusable.Blue Origin will use its still-in-development New Glenn rocket to launch its lunar missions from Cape Canaveral. Starship, the world's largest rocket, made its debut last month from South Texas; the test flight ended in an explosive fireball a few minutes into flight.Blue Origin's team includes five partners: Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Draper, Astrobotic Technology and Honeybee Robotics.Only one other bid was submitted for the contract competition, according to NASA.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the mission that NASA has given to Rhea Space Activity?",
  "answer_squad": " Spitzer Resurrector Mission",
  "text": "NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope served the astronomy community well for 16 years. From its launch in 2003 to the end of its operations in January 2020, its infrared observations fueled scientific discoveries too numerous to list.          Infrared telescopes need to be kept cool to operate, and eventually, it ran out of coolant. But that wasn't the end of the mission; it kept operating in \"warm\" mode, where observations were limited. Its mission only ended when it drifted too far away from Earth to communicate effectively.Now NASA thinks they can reboot the telescope.The Spitzer was one of four powerful space-based observatories in NASA's Great Observatories program. The other three are the Hubble, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. Together, they covered gamma rays, X-rays, visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared. (Radio waves are easily observed from Earth.) The Compton was de-orbited in 2000, and the Hubble and the Chandra are still operating.While the JWST is a much more powerful infrared instrument than the Spitzer, its observing time is in extremely high demand. Also, not all observations require such extreme power. The Spitzer could still perform scientifically valuable observations if it were operating.                This montage contains an image from each of the Spitzer\u2019s first twelve years of operations. Image Credit: NASA/JPL             But now NASA thinks they may be able to get the Spitzer back into operations. They've given Rhea Space Activity an STTR (Small Business Technology Transfer) worth $250,000 to develop the Spitzer Resurrector Mission (SRM.) The SRM would travel to Spitzer's location, service it, and restore it to observational operations.The Spitzer follows an unusual Earth-trailing, heliocentric orbit, rather than a geocentric orbit like the Hubble. Over time, the Spitzer drifted, and in 2016, it had to be reoriented and pitched over at an extreme angle in order to communicate with Earth. But that meant that the solar panels were not fully illuminated, further limiting operations. Finally, on January 30th, 2020, NASA sent a shutdown signal to the telescope and pronounced the mission over.The telescope orbits the sun at a distance of one AU and is now on the other side of the sun, about two AU away from Earth.      So the Spitzer is sitting out there with its equipment intact, but out of coolant and struggling to gather enough solar power to do anything. But it's in safe mode, not dead. The STR mission would rectify this.The STR is a telerobotics mission, and it would travel about 300 million km (186 million miles) and rendezvous with Spitzer. \"Spitzer Resurrector is designed to restart Spitzer, confirm that it has been restored to its original performance capabilities, and then remain nearby to act as a high-rate data relay to Earth, thus restoring Spitzer to its full efficiency,\" Rhea Space Activity said in a press release.                The Spitzer Space Telescope observatory trails behind Earth as it orbits the Sun. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech             If successful, this would be a remarkable achievement. The ability to service spacecraft in this way would be another significant leap in capabilities for space-based astronomy.Before the mission was shut down, Spitzer observing time was in high demand among astronomers. Once back in operation, the telescope would no doubt be busy with astronomical observations again. But Spitzer's role would also be to find and characterize Near-Earth Objects, something that the telescope helped pioneer with its infrared capabilities.The effort to revitalize Spitzer is part of In-space Service Assembly and Manufacturing (ISAM,) and the techniques employed by the STR are being explored by the Department of the Air Force (DAF) and United States Space Force (USSF). So the STR would also serve as a technology demonstration for those techniques.\"The ISAM implications of resurrecting Spitzer are jaw-dropping,\" said Shawn Usman, Astrophysicist and CEO of Rhea Space Activity. \"This would be the most complex robotic mission ever performed by humanity. As a teenager in the 1990s, I watched U.S. astronauts repair the first Great Observatory, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and now Rhea Space Activity has been given the opportunity to telerobotically extend the life of the last Great Observatory, the Spitzer Space Telescope. I am humbled to have Dr. Giovanni Fazio, the Principal Investigator of Spitzer's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC), as a Co-Investigator on this ambitious mission.\"Spitzer's IRAC instrument was a prolific piece of equipment, and its data led to thousands of scientific papers. While this mission will restore Spitzer to operations, it won't actually dock with the telescope, so it won't be able to add coolant. The telescope will still be restricted to warm mode, so IRAC will be operating in only its two shorter wavelength bands, not the full spectrum of four bands that it's capable of.NASA has given Rhea Space Activity a Phase 1 STTR, and RSA is pursuing a Phase 2 STTR. There's still a lot of work to do before the Spitzer can be operational again, and neither RSA nor NASA has given a timeline for when the mission might take place.

  "text": "A team of physicists have discovered that the environment of a molecular cloud in interstellar space can support the existence of fatty acids, a key component of life on Earth.          Astronomers have made great strides over the past few years in identifying a variety of organic and prebiotic molecules in interstellar gas clouds. These molecules, rich in carbon and oxygen, form the basic building blocks of the chemistry used by life. For example, astronomers have recently discovered some amino acids, which are the fundamental components of all proteins used by life on Earth.As astronomers continue to discover ever more complex organic molecules, it's natural to wonder what else could be out there. But space is an exceptionally harsh environment for life, not just because of its low temperatures, but also because of the intense radiation constantly flooding through any region of interstellar space.Despite these challenges, a team of physicists ran a series of computer simulations of the typical interstellar environment and discovered that fatty acids can form and stabilize there. Fatty acids are chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms that form the building blocks of every kind of fat that we consume and maintain in our bodies.The researchers discovered that carbon and hydrogen can naturally link together in spite of the low temperature and low pressure environments of interstellar gas clouds. These chains then form stable bonds that can persist for long timescales. Their research is available on the arXiv pre-print server.Fatty acids also combine with amino acids to form much more complex protein structures, and so the discovery of fatty acids in nebulae would confirm that the ingredients for life are abundant throughout the cosmos.To find these fatty acids the astronomers discovered that we can use existing techniques. One such technique is called microwave rotational spectra. The fatty acids can rotate in certain ways which release particular frequencies of microwave radiation that we can detect. Further observations will be necessary to discover if these essential ingredients truly exist in the depths of space.

  "text": "On May 9, NASA's Lucy spacecraft carried out a trajectory correction maneuver to set the spacecraft on course for its close encounter with the small main belt asteroid Dinkinesh. The maneuver changed the velocity of the spacecraft by only about 7.7 mph (3.4 m/s).       Even though the spacecraft is currently traveling at approximately 43,000 mph (19.4 km/s), this small nudge is enough to move the spacecraft nearly 40,000 miles (65,000 km) closer to the asteroid during the planned encounter on Nov. 1, 2023. The spacecraft will fly a mere 265 miles (425 km) from the small, half-mile-(sub-km)-sized asteroid, while traveling at a relative speed of 10,000 mph (4.5 km/s).The Lucy team will continue to monitor the spacecraft's trajectory and will have further opportunities to fine tune the flight path if needed.The Lucy team is also continuing to analyze the data collected from its spring instrument calibration campaign and make other preparations for the mission's first asteroid encounter. This encounter will provide a valuable test of the spacecraft's systems and procedures to make sure that everything operates as expected during the mission's high-speed asteroid encounters.

  "text": "Researchers have observed the X-ray emission of the most luminous quasar seen in the last 9 billion years of cosmic history, known as SMSS J114447.77-430859.3, or J1144 for short. The new perspective sheds light on the inner workings of quasars and how they interact with their environment. The research is published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.Hosted by a galaxy 9.6 billion light years away from the Earth, between the constellations of Centaurus and Hydra, J1144 is extremely powerful, shining 100,000 billion times brighter than the sun. J1144 is much closer to Earth than other sources of the same luminosity, allowing astronomers to gain insight into the black hole powering the quasar and its surrounding environment.The study was led by Dr. Elias Kammoun, a postdoctoral researcher at the Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology (IRAP), and Zsofi Igo, a Ph.D. candidate at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE).Quasars are among the brightest and most distant objects in the known universe, powered by the fall of gas into a supermassive black hole. They can be described as active galactic nuclei (AGN) of very high luminosity that emit vast amounts of electromagnetic radiation observable in radio, infrared, visible, ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths. J1144 was initially observed in visible wavelengths in 2022 by the SkyMapper Southern Survey (SMSS).For this study, researchers combined observations from several space-based observatories: the eROSITA instrument on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory, the ESA XMM-Newton observatory, NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), and NASA's Neil Gehrels Swift observatory.The team used the data from the four observatories to measure the temperature of the X-rays being emitted from the quasar. They found this temperature to be around 350 million Kelvin, more than 60,000 times the temperature at the surface of the sun. The team also found that the mass of the black hole at the quasar's center is around 10 billion times the mass of the sun, and the rate at which it is growing to be of the order of 100 solar masses per year.The X-ray light from this source varied on a time scale of a few days, which is not usually seen in quasars with black holes as large as the one residing in J1144. The typical timescale of variability for a black hole of this size would be on the order of months or even years. The observations also showed that while a portion of the gas is swallowed by the black hole, some gas is ejected in the form of extremely powerful winds, injecting large amounts of energy into the host galaxy.Dr. Kammoun, lead author of the paper, says \"We were very surprised that no prior X-ray observatory has ever observed this source despite its extreme power.\"He adds, \"Similar quasars are usually found at much larger distances, so they appear much fainter, and we see them as they were when the Universe was only 2-3 billion years old. J1144 is a very rare source as it is so luminous and much closer to Earth (although still at a huge distance!), giving us a unique glimpse of what such powerful quasars look like.\"\"A new monitoring campaign of this source will start in June this year, which may reveal more surprises from this unique source.\" More information:E S Kammoun et al, The first X-ray look at SMSS J114447.77-430859.3: the most luminous quasar in the last 9 Gyr, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (2023).

  "text": "The Mastcam-Z instrument aboard NASA's Perseverance Mars rover recently collected 152 images while looking deep into Belva Crater, a large impact crater within the far larger Jezero Crater. Stitched into a dramatic mosaic, the results are not only eye-catching, but also provide the rover's science team some deep insights into the interior of Jezero.          \"Mars rover missions usually end up exploring bedrock in small, flat exposures in the immediate workspace of the rover,\" said Katie Stack Morgan, deputy project scientist of Perseverance at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"That's why our science team was so keen to image and study Belva. Impact craters can offer grand views and vertical cuts that provide important clues to the origin of these rocks with a perspective and at a scale that we don't usually experience.\"On Earth, geology professors often take their students to visit highway \"roadcuts\" \u2013places where construction crews have sliced vertically into the rock to make way for roads\u2014that allow them to view rock layers and other geological features not visible at the surface. On Mars, impact craters like Belva can provide a type of natural roadcut.Signs of past waterPerseverance took the images of the basin on April 22 (the 772nd Martian day, or sol, of the mission) while parked just west of Belva Crater's rim on a light-toned rocky outcrop the mission's science team calls \"Echo Creek.\" Created by a meteorite impact eons ago, the approximately 0.6-mile-wide (0.9-kilometer-wide) crater reveals multiple locations of exposed bedrock as well as a region where sedimentary layers angle steeply downward.                This anaglyph of Perseverance\u2019s mosaic of Belva Crater can best be viewed with red-blue 3D glasses. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU/MSSS             These \"dipping beds\" could indicate the presence of a large Martian sandbar, made of sediment, that billions of years ago was deposited by a river channel flowing into the lake that Jezero Crater once held.The science team suspects the large boulders in the foreground are either chunks of bedrock exposed by the meteorite impact or that they may have been transported into the crater by the river system. The scientists will search for answers by continuing to compare features found in bedrock near the rover to the larger-scale rock layers visible in the distant crater walls.To help with those efforts, the mission also created an anaglyph, or 3D version, of the mosaic. \"An anaglyph can help us visualize the geologic relationships between the crater wall outcrops,\" said Stack. \"But it also provides an opportunity to simply enjoy an awesome view. When I look at this mosaic through red-blue 3D glasses, I'm transported to the western rim of Belva, and I wonder what future astronauts would be thinking if they were to stand where Perseverance once stood when it took this shot.\" Provided byNASACitation:Perseverance rover captures view of Mars' Belva Crater (2023, May 18)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-perseverance-rover-captures-view-mars.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_squad": " Space Forge",
  "text": "A revolution in space manufacturing is coming. Enabled by cheaper launch costs, companies are scrambling to take advantage of easier access to the benefits space offers as a manufacturing environment. These include a constant vacuum, near absolute zero temperatures, and a lack of any significant gravity. These features would enable easier processing and manufacturing of hundreds of products, from pharmaceuticals to metal alloys. The tricky part is getting them back down to Earth, where they can be used.       A company based in the U.K. recently revealed what they think is a viable solution for that. Space Forge, which is developing a reusable manufacturing platform for use in space, recently discussed their Pridwen heat shield. The most remarkable thing about this new heat shield is it's reusable.Typical heat shields, such as those used on the Apollo missions and even on the more modern Dragon capsules from SpaceX, are \"ablative.\" That means they burn up in the atmosphere on reentry and must be replaced every time the capsule returns. That is costly, time-consuming, and wasteful\u2014it is one of the last holdouts of the old space launch model that SpaceX is still holding on to. That seems to be because there was no better alternative than an ablative heat shield when Dragon was designed more than ten years ago.Bloomberg video on in-space manufacturing. Credit: Bloomberg Originals YouTube ChannelSo, Space Forge is attempting to fill that gap in the market with new technology. Pridwen, which takes its name from King Arthur's shield, is made of a high-temperature alloy that can fold up in the fairing it is launched on and then unfurls to a much larger size when the craft it is attached to returns to Earth.For Space Forge's first efforts, that craft will be the ForgeStar. This manufacturing platform is intended to go to space for short periods, manufacture specialized products, and then return to Earth with those products entirely manufactured. On its way back to the ground, its descent will be aided by a \"soft landing\" on Fielder, an autonomous recovery boat that can catch ForgeStar as it returns to Earth.That soft landing is critical, as many of Space Forge's customers have concerns about a hard landing for the experiments they have already tried to run in space. For experiments returning from the ISS, many don't survive either reentry or impact, making any business model for manufacturing products in space unviable unless they can prove that the product returns in good shape.Video from Space Forge explaining the ForgeStar. Credit: Space Forge YouTube ChannelSo far, the company has yet to prove that, though they are actively working on fleshing out their designs. Unfortunately, an early prototype didn't go as planned when the now-defunct Virgin Orbit's launcher it was attached to failed to reach orbit. Luckily, this was just one of many planned launches for the company, so a failure wasn't as devastating as it would have been for something like James Webb, which took billions of dollars and decades to design.And the company seems well-capitalized enough to continue. It received a $10.2 million funding round back in 2021 and expects to announce news about another funding round soon. With luck, the company's next test will prove successful, and it can begin fleshing out its business model as part of the world's first steps in the space manufacturing revolution.

  "text": "It is as inevitable as the rising of the sun and the turning of the tides. Someday another large rock from space will crash into the Earth. It has happened for billions of years in the past and will continue to happen for billions of years into the future. So far humanity has been lucky, as we have not had to face such a catastrophic threat. But if we are to survive on this planet for the long term, we will have to come to terms with the reality of hazardous asteroids and prepare ourselves.          Organizations around the world continue to monitor the skies. They are creating maps and catalogs of all potentially hazardous near-Earth objects, or NEOs. Obviously the larger rocks pose a bigger threat, but thankfully they are less numerous. And while our census of hazardous NEOs is not nearly complete, we do have reliable maps of nearly all of the potentially hazardous asteroids larger than a kilometer across.This is useful, to say the least, because kilometer-scale asteroids have the potential to not only wipe out entire cities, but could cause significant ecological harm across the globe.To estimate the risk that these large NEOs pose, a team of astronomers have predicted their orbits over the next thousand years. Their analysis, available on the pre-print server arXiv, suggests that none of these kilometer-scale NEOs pose a significant risk to us over the next century. However, we have difficulty predicting the orbits of these NEOs past that. This is because in orbital dynamics small changes can lead to big effects over enormous timescales. A slight difference in the amount of heating that an asteroid receives from the sun, or an unexpected tug from Jupiter, could send an asteroid on a trajectory that in a few thousand years ends up intersecting the Earth.Credit: Universe TodayThe astronomers studied the closest possible encounter between the known hazardous NEOs and the Earth. They particularly examined how this closest distance changes over the course of hundreds and thousands of years. They did this through a series of simulations that mapped out as many possible orbital trajectories as possible given uncertainties in the current orbital positions and velocities of the NEOs.The astronomers identified one particular NEO, Asteroid 7482, as especially hazardous. This asteroid will spend a significant amount of time near the Earth for the next millennium. While that doesn't necessarily mean that it will strike our planet, it does mean that this rock poses the greatest chance of a collision within the next thousand years. The researchers also highlighted another asteroid, Asteroid 143651, that has such a chaotic orbit that it's impossible to predict its exact position past a few decades. Thus while might or might not pose a threat at all, based on our current understanding of its position and its velocity we cannot say for certain.Altogether the astronomers identified 28 candidates that have a non-zero probability of a \"deep encounter,\" which means they will pass within less than the distance to the moon. None of these objects may hit the Earth in the next hundred or a thousand years, but if we are to survive long-term, we definitely need to pay attention to them.

  "text": "At the end of a star's life, nuclear fusion ceases, and the resulting pressure is no longer sufficient to counteract the gravitational force. This collapse can lead to the formation of neutron stars, which are composed of the densest matter in the universe. However, the composition of neutron stars has been the subject of much controversy.          Based on observations of neutron stars and quantum chromodynamics theory, a research team led by Prof. Fan Yizhong from the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has found that a strange quark matter core likely exists in massive neutron stars. Observing this exotic core provides a unique opportunity to explore the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter, particularly the transition from hadronic to quark matter.The study was published in Science Bulletin on April 11.The researchers analyzed data on neutron star mass and radius, gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers, and theoretical constraints from quantum chromodynamics calculations. Benefitting from the joint information and their newly developed statistical method, the researchers studied the structure of the dense matter EOS in detail.They found that a peak structure in the sound speed of the EOS commonly appeared in the posterior, located at a density lower than the center density of the most massive neutron star. Such non-monotonic behavior suggested that the state deviates from pure hadronic matter.Additionally, they found support for the existence of an exotic core in neutron stars heavier than 0.98 times the most massive one, based on a posterior that satisfies both observational and theoretical constraints.Quantitative analysis revealed that the state at the center of the most massive neutron star is softer than typical hadronic matter (even with hyperons), and a sizable exotic core (>1km) is plausible.

  "text": "Satellites launched into outer space could send back improved warnings of dangerous solar storms thanks to a breakthrough in the way scientists use space weather measurements.          Experts from the University of Reading have found that using satellite data that is less reliable but is returned to Earth rapidly can be used to improve the accuracy of solar wind forecasts\u2014which are harmful streams of charged particles sent from the sun\u2014by nearly 50%.Their research, published today in Space Weather, could pave the way for agencies, such as the Met Office, to provide more accurate forecasts for severe space weather, which can cause blackouts and harm human health.Lead researcher Harriet Turner, from the University of Reading's Department of Meteorology, said, \"We know lots about how to prepare for storms that form on Earth, but we need to improve our forecasts of the dangerous weather we get from space. Space weather threatens our technology-focused way of life as it can cause power grids to fail, damage satellites, such as GPS, and even make astronauts ill.\"Our research has shown that using rapid satellite measurements to forecast space weather is effective. By sending spacecraft far from Earth, we can use this new technique to get better solar storm predictions and ensure we are prepared for what's to come.\"Simon Machin, Met Office Space Weather Manager, said, \"This is a great example of the value that can result through our collaboration with academia. By pulling through scientific research into the operational domain, improved space weather forecasting will ultimately enhance our nation's ability to prepare for and mitigate against space weather events.\"Old dogs and new tricksTo predict space weather, scientists need to forecast the solar wind conditions at Earth. To do this, they combine computer simulations with observations from space to estimate what space weather will be like. This is known as data assimilation. The highest quality observations only become available many days after they are made, as they are processed on the ground and \"cleaned,\" meaning forecasts take longer to achieve.To obtain forecasts faster, the research team tried using near-real-time (NRT) data. NRT data undergoes no processing or cleaning, meaning it is less accurate but can be made available within a couple of hours. The research team found that forecasts produced using the NRT data still produces reliable predictions and enables greater warning time. This could enable authorities to better prepare for power failures that cost up to 2.1 trillion dollars over a century in the U.S. and Europe.To the starsThe scientists behind this new study say using this new technique with upcoming space missions will enable better forecasts.The European Space Agency (ESA) will launch \"Vigil\" in the mid-2020s, a first-of-its-kind mission that will monitor potentially hazardous solar activity using a number of U.K.-built instruments.By launching the spacecraft into a position 60 degrees behind Earth in longitude, the Met Office will be able to improve space weather forecasts by using data assimilation of the NRT solar wind data.It is hoped the unique location of Vigil will allow scientists to see the solar wind that will later arrive at Earth, maximizing forecast accuracy and warning time.

With an El Ni\u00f1o looming, concerns are that we will soon be facing even worse extremes. Satellites orbiting overhead are being used to carefully track the patterns that lead up to El Ni\u00f1o to further understand and predict the consequences of this cyclic phenomenon against the backdrop of climate change.          The coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere system of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a, together known as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, are drivers of significant variations in global temperature and precipitation, on top of the warming trend caused by climate change.El Ni\u00f1o occurs every few years when the trade winds weaken allowing warm water in the western Pacific Ocean to shift eastward, bringing with it changes in wind patterns and ocean dynamics. This can have a significant impact on weather around the world, leading to changes in ecosystems and fisheries, droughts, floods and storms, among others.Climate models suggest that after three years of La Ni\u00f1a, which has a general cooling effect on the planet, in the next few months we will face a return to the more troublesome El Ni\u00f1o.Climate change is already fueling the recent extreme temperatures that many of us have had to deal with, so the worrying question is whether this impending El Ni\u00f1o will make matters even worse.Monitoring changes in the temperature and height of the sea surface, together with the surface wind patterns that result from the interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere, helps us to understand the mechanisms that drive El Ni\u00f1o events.Moreover, scientists have to take climate change into account, which is likely to amplify the extremes that this El Ni\u00f1o, and future El Ni\u00f1o events, will bring.Satellites orbiting above are paramount to delivering the data for this kind of research because the Tropical Pacific Ocean, the home of El Ni\u00f1o, is so large it is difficult to monitor.ESA's lead ocean scientist, Craig Donlon, said, \"More than 70% of our planet is covered by ocean. It plays an enormous role in the climate system.The animation shows sea-surface temperatures from the beginning of January to mid-May 2023 compared to a reference period 1985\u20131993.

These complementary datasets work together to provide a unique picture of the evolving El Ni\u00f1o.\"Built by ESA and operated by Eumetsat, the Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission is unique in delivering measurements of global sea-surface temperature as well as sea-surface height from the same satellite platform.The mission comprises two identical satellites, each carrying the same suite of instruments\u2014one of which is the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer, which measures global sea-surface temperatures every day to an accuracy of better than 0.3 K.The other is a radar altimeter that measures sea-surface height, significant wave height and wind speed. In addition, its imager, called the Ocean and Land Color Imager, allows scientists to study the biological signatures in the ocean that are modified by El Ni\u00f1o.Sentinel-3's radiometer is used by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites within its Sea Surface Temperature Virtual Constellation for a better understanding phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events, and ocean currents and heat exchange between the ocean and atmosphere.Sentinel-6 is the reference altimeter used to homogenize other satellite altimeter data to provide measurements of sea-level rise every 10 days.Importantly, data from both missions are delivered in near-real time.ESA currently building a further two Sentinel-3 satellites, Sentinel-3C and Sentinel-3D, to ensure continuity of such measurements. Looking to the future, ESA is also developing the follow-on Copernicus Sentinel-3 Next Generation mission.ESA\u2019s Climate Change Initiative uses Earth observation satellites to monitor and measure the effects of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a in the context of a changing global climate. El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a are the warm and cool phases of a recurring climate cycle that occurs across the tropical Pacific Ocean, affecting global weather patterns and influencing the likelihood of floods, droughts, heatwaves and cold periods for different regions. Credit: Planetary VisionsA second Sentinel-6 satellite is currently in storage and is due for launch in the next few years to maintain the sea-level record.Since sea-surface temperature is an important essential climate variable, ESA's Climate Change Initiative also feeds in Sentinel-3 data to its Sea Surface Temperature Project.The future Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer mission is set to provide all-weather high-resolution sea-surface temperature measurements. In addition, the Copernicus Land Surface Temperature Monitoring mission will provide very high-resolution sea-surface temperature data in coastal zones.In short, the Copernicus program is well-prepared to continue monitoring our oceans well into the future.Warming oceans are indeed a worry, and now with an El Ni\u00f1o on the horizon, the world is braced for the impact it will have.El Ni\u00f1o is likely to affect more than 60 million people, particularly in eastern and southern Africa, the Horn of Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Asia-Pacific region.Severe drought and associated food insecurity, flooding, rains, and temperature rises due to El Ni\u00f1o can cause a wide range of health problems, including disease outbreaks, malnutrition, heat stress and respiratory diseases.\"Satellites orbiting Earth, now and in the future, not only those monitoring our oceans but measuring many different aspects of our planet, are more important than ever.

  "answer_race": " Dark photons can be detected using radio telescopes",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the spherical radio telescope in China?",
  "answer_squad": " FAST",
  "text": "Dark matter, matter in the universe that does not emit, absorb or reflect light, cannot be directly detected using conventional telescopes or other imaging technologies. Astrophysicists have thus been trying to identify alternative methods to detect dark matter for decades.          Researchers at Tsinghua University, the Purple Mountain Observatory and Peking University recently carried out a study exploring the possibility of directly detecting dark photons, prominent dark matter candidates, using radio telescopes. Their paper, published in Physical Review Letters, could inform future searches for dark photons, which are hypothetical particles that would carry a force in dark matter, similarly to how photons carry electromagnetism in normal matter.\"Our previous work studied the conversion of dark photons into photons in the solar corona,\" Haipeng An, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org.\"This process involves the excitation of free electrons by dark photon fields, leading to the emission of normal photons. Building on this work, Jia and I considered using the free electrons in a dished telescope to induce electromagnetic signals and then using the FAST telescope to search for search such a signal.\"Soon after, they started exploring the use of dished telescopes to search for dark photon-related electromagnetic signals, An and his colleagues realized that due to the non-relativistic nature of dark matter, the reflector in such telescopes would need to be spherical and the receiver of the signal should be placed at the center of this sphere.Existing dished radio telescopes, however, such as the five-hundred-meter aperture spherical radio telescope (FAST) in China, are designed to observed remote radio signals, thus the shape of their dish is parabolic, with the receiver placed at the point of focus.This meant that electromagnetic signals induced by dark photons would not concentrate at their receiver.\"After this realization, we temporarily gave up on this idea,\" An explained. \"In the summer of 2021, I was invited to give lectures about dark matter at the UFITS summer school for cosmology held at the FAST site, where I studied the details of how the FAST telescope works. I learned that the receiver suspended above the dish could move around such that the telescope could observe radio waves from different directions. I then came up with the idea that although the dark photon dark matter-induced EM waves are not focused on the receiver, the EM field can form a distribution on top of the dish, and this distribution can be accurately calculated theoretically.\"      According to An's subsequent theoretical predictions, the movable receiver in radio telescopes should be able to collect electromagnetic signals in different locations. The signals collected by the receiver could then be compared to distributions predicted by theory, which would help to improve the sensitivity of the telescopes to dark photon-induced signals.\"With our colleagues, we then started to calculate this signal,\" An said. \"To our surprise, we found that even without considering the distribution, with the extraordinary sensitivity, even with the fact that the dark photon dark matter induced signal is not focused at the receiver, the sensitivity of the FAST telescope has already surpassed the CMB constraint, which means that the FAST telescope can discover the dark matter if the dark matter is composed by dark photon and is in the right mass region.\"To further assess the viability of their proposed method to search for dark photons, An and his colleagues also analyzed observation data collected by the FAST radio telescope, which is located in a village in the mountains in the Guizhou region in China. This data was provided by Prof. Xiaoyuan Huang, who is also a co-author of the recent paper.\"We analyzed the data and placed the most stringent bound on the model in the 1\u20131.5 GHz frequency range,\" An said. \"We realized that dark photon dark matter could induce electric signals on dipole antennas and that due to the non-relativistic nature, we could use interferometry technology to improve the sensitivity, Therefore, we calculate the potential sensitivity of the LOFAR telescope and the future SKA telescope and find they both have the potential to discover dark photon dark matter. \"Overall, the analyses conducted by this team of researchers suggest that radio telescopes could potentially enable the direct detection of dark photons. Their work could thus broaden horizons in the ongoing search for dark photons, particularly ultra-light dark photons.\"In the early 1960s, while conducting research in radio astronomy, Penzias and Wilson stumbled upon an unexpected low-level background noise,\" An said. \"This noise was later confirmed to be the cosmic microwave background radiation, providing important evidence for the hot early expansion of the universe. Ultra-light dark photons exhibit photon-like electromagnetic interactions through kinetic mixing with photons. As a candidate for diffuse dark matter in the universe, ultra-light dark photons can display behavior similar to that of cosmic microwave background radiation. By carefully listening with modern radio telescopes, elusive whispers from the dark world may be heard.\"Ultralight dark photons can behave similarly to dark electromagnetic fields with specific frequencies, and this research team showed that it could potentially be detected using radio telescopes, instruments that are commonly used to observe cosmic microwave background. In the future, their theoretical considerations could inform searches for dark photon dark matter that rely on large-scale radio telescope observations.\"Our work may open a new sub-area in radio astronomy,\" An added. \"We now plan to search for dark photon dark matter signals in the data from LOFAR and MeerKAT telescopes. We also plan to apply this idea to search for axion dark matter, another competitive ultralight dark matter candidate.\" More information:Haipeng An et al, Direct Detection of Dark Photon Dark Matter Using Radio Telescopes, Physical Review Letters (2023).

  "answer_race": " To inform readers of the discovery of XTE J1906+090.",
  "question_squad": " What is the spin period of a Be/X-ray binary?",
  "answer_squad": " 89 seconds",
  "text": "Using INTEGRAL and Swift spacecraft, European astronomers have observed an unidentified X-ray source known as XTE J1906+090. Results of the observational campaign, presented May 11 on the arXiv preprint server, suggest that this source belongs to the small and rare group of persistent low-luminosity Be X-ray binaries.          X-ray binaries are composed of a normal star or a white dwarf transferring mass onto a compact neutron star or a black hole. Based on the mass of the companion star, astronomers divide them into low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXB) and high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXB).Of special interest are Be/X-ray binaries (BeXRBs), a subclass of HMXBs in which the optical star is a dwarf, subgiant or giant OBe star. Studying X-ray outbursts from BeXRBs could be essential in order to improve our understanding of the nature of X-ray binaries and their behavior.XTE J1906+090 was first detected in 1996 with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) spacecraft and initially classified as an unidentified transient X-ray pulsar with a spin period of about 89 seconds. Previous studies of XTE J1906+090 have suggested that it may be a BeXRB system at a distance of some 33,000 light years, however due to the lack of optical and infrared spectroscopy, it was difficult to confirm this.Now, based on the data from the INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) and from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, a team of astronomers led by Vito Sguera of the Astrophysics and Space Science Observatory of Bologna, Italy, has provided further evidence supporting the BeXRB scenario for XTE J1906+090.According to the study, XTE J1906+090 has been consistently detected by Swift at a persistent low X-ray luminosity value of about 10 to 40 decillion erg/s, with limited variability. Therefore, the X-ray characteristics of this source, together with its long spin period, strongly resemble those of persistent low-luminosity BeXRBs, which are a small and rare subgroup of peculiar BeXRBs.\"Such properties suggest that the compact object orbits the donor Be star in a wide (orbital periods longer than \u223c 30 days) and nearly circular (e<0.2) orbit, rarely or never crossing the decretion disk star and continuously accreting material from the lower density outer regions of the stellar wind,\" the researchers explained.The observations also detected four X-ray outbursts of XTE J1906+090 characterized by a similar X-ray luminosity of about 1,000 decillion erg/s. The astronomers noted that similar sporadic variability has been already observed in all the BeXRBs which are traditionally considered as persistent sources.Moreover, the researchers found that the maximum to minimum luminosity ratio of XTE J1906+090 is fully consistent with that observed in most of the persistent BeXRBs. However, they added that much deeper X-ray spectral investigation of this source is needed in order to draw final conclusions regarding its nature. More information:V.

  "text": "A novel origami-based heat shield developed with ESA support is planned to be tested with an actual atmospheric reentry from space. Named Pridwen, after the legendary shield of King Arthur, this reusable design will spring out before a spacecraft reenters the atmosphere.       As a spacecraft commences its return to Earth and encounters the atmosphere its orbital velocity gets converted into such high heat fluxes that an unprotected spacecraft will simply burn up. Which is where heat shields come in.Standard 'ablative' heat shields remove unwanted heat by having pieces of the shield gradually burn off. Instead of ablation, Pridwen relies on radiation: its high temperature alloy fabric has a sufficiently high surface area that the heat flux can spread evenly across it to gradually radiate the heat away.Credit: Space ForgeThe shuttlecock-style Pridwen shield will also serve to slow down a satellite sufficiently that it can survive landing without a parachute. Its maker, Space Forge in Cardiff, UK, plans to capture satellites with a hover net.The heat shield has undergone multiple drop tests from as high as 17 km and practiced net captures of test items falling at terminal velocity. The company has developed Pridwen as part of a larger vision of in-orbit manufacturing of high-value goods such as pharmaceuticals, superconductors and super alloys, to be returned to Earth on a routine basis.The first Pridwen heat shield is planned for flight aboard the company's inaugural ForgeStar-1A mission later this year.

  "text": "The heart of NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope was recently delivered to Ball Aerospace in Boulder, Colorado, for integration into the WFI (Wide Field Instrument). Called the FPS (Focal Plane System), it serves as the core of Roman's camera. When the mission launches by May 2027, astronomers will use this system to gather exquisite images to help unravel the secrets of dark energy and dark matter, discover exoplanets, and explore many topics in infrared astrophysics.          The FPS is made up of a large detector array and its associated electronics. The detectors were developed by engineers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and Teledyne Scientific & Imaging in Camarillo, California. The Goddard team also developed the electronics and assembled the FPS. Each of Roman's 18 detectors has 16.8 million tiny pixels, which will provide the mission with remarkable image resolution. Through these \"eyes,\" we will be able to peer through dust and across vast stretches of the cosmos, creating high-resolution panoramas of the universe.\"Roman's focal plane array is one of the biggest that has ever flown onboard a space-based observatory,\" said Mary Walker, the Roman WFI manager at Goddard. \"Its creation is the product of many years of innovation from a very dedicated team\u2014one that is eagerly anticipating the incredible science Roman will yield.\"Once the FPS is installed in the spacecraft's WFI\u2014its camera\u2014technicians will continue the build by integrating the instrument's radiators.\"For optimal performance, the detectors must be operated at minus 288 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 178 degrees Celsius,\" said Greg Mosby, a research astrophysicist and Roman detector scientist at Goddard. \"Roman's detectors are so sensitive that nearby components in the Wide Field Instrument must also be cooled, otherwise their heat would saturate the detectors, effectively blinding the observatory.\" The radiators will redirect waste heat from the instrument's components away from the detectors out into cold space, ensuring that Roman will be sensitive to faint signals from distant galaxies and other cosmic objects.After the radiators are installed, Roman's camera will be complete and ready for thermal vacuum tests this summer. The team expects the entire WFI to return to Goddard in spring of 2024, where it will ultimately be integrated into the rest of the observatory.

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the technical term for a red nova?",
  "answer_squad": " intermediate luminosity optical transits",
  "text": "Back in 2020 astronomers observed a red nova, which while enormously powerful, is on the low side of energetic events in the universe. Now an astronomer has studied the event in close detail and has come to the conclusion that we have just witnessed a star destroying its own planet.          The technical jargon term for these red nova events are \"intermediate luminosity optical transits,\" or ILOTs. These are extremely rare events to observe, because they only produce a moderate amount of energy. That makes it hard for us to capture them in observations. But despite the rarity of the events, astronomers suspect that they occur very frequently throughout the universe.For years astronomers have wondered if these red novas were caused by planets being engulfed by their parent stars. Several ILOT candidates have been closely examined with this scenario in mind, but astronomers have found it difficult to match up theoretical predictions of this scenario with the actual observational results.But this new observation, known as ZTF SLRN-2020, may just fit the bill. Previous cases of suspected star-planet interactions happen in very young systems, where planets are on chaotic trajectories, colliding into each other and occasionally diving headfirst into their stars. But in this case the star is on the main sequence, meaning that it is a normal middle-aged star. The research is published on the arXiv preprint server.The astronomer behind the study concluded based on theoretical calculations that however this planet ended up getting close to its star, it was not a simple matter of the planet slipping into the atmosphere of the star and calling it a day. Instead it went through several violent phases as the planet was torn apart and the red nova flared.As the planet neared the star it heated up, with its outer layers turning into a plasma. Complex flows of electricity and magnetism caused this plasma to launch a pair of jets away from the planet as it was orbiting the star. However, those jets were not powerful enough to escape from the gravitational influence of the star completely, and so that material rained back down.But even though the planet reacquired some of its mass lost in the form of the jets, the planet lost it again due to the intense energies near the surface of the star. Before complete engulfment, the planet might have formed an accretion disk around the star itself. Material from the destroyed planet slowly leaked and funneled into the star before it was all finally over. However, the accretion disk itself would be capable of launching its own jets which could punch away from the star, expanding and nebula away from the system.Needless to say, the interaction between the planet and the star over the course of its engulfment released an incredible amount of energy resulting in the red nova. We still do not know the details of the system or how this planet came to be so unlucky. Astronomers hope to find even more of these lower energy transient events to help us understand the complex relationships between planets and their parent stars.

  "text": "Anyone can become an asteroid hunter thanks to a new program launched by astronomers at the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. As part of the Catalina Sky Survey, the scientists created an online portal that opens their mission\u2014the discovery and identification of space rocks that regularly visit Earth's neighborhood\u2014to the general public.          While gazing up at the night sky with the naked eye, one might see stars, planets and the occasional airplane. What one usually won't see, however, are asteroids and comets\u2014lumps of rock tumbling through space\u2014left over from the formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago. Because of their origin, these space objects might hold clues about the formation of the sun and planets, scientists believe.Through the new portal, scientists from the Catalina Sky Survey will share potential asteroid and comet detections from their ground-based telescopes with anyone with an internet connection. Even amateurs can help scientists find unknown objects in the solar system as they click through and pore over high-resolution, telescope snapshots of the sky that scientists haven't been able to look at.\"I thought it would be great if people could do what we do every night,\" said Carson Fuls, a science engineering specialist for the Catalina Sky Survey who heads the project. \"We see this website as throwing open the doors: Do you want to look for asteroids, too? If so, come on in.\"To begin asteroid hunting, participants must create an account on Zooniverse, an online platform for people-powered research. Through the website, volunteers without any specialized training or expertise assist professional researchers from various fields. In the case of the public asteroid detection portal, a basic tutorial will have participants picking out moving asteroids from pictures in no time.Participants look at sets of images of the night sky taken by one of the Catalina Sky Survey telescopes. Each image set contains four exposures taken six or seven minutes apart. The pictures are noteworthy because software spotted a moving speck of light from one image to the next, which may or may not represent the light reflected from a faraway comet or asteroid.The task for the amateur asteroid hunter: Decide if the identified speck of light in the images looks like a genuine celestial body or, rather, is a false detection resulting from inconveniently timed \"twinkles\" of the star-studded background, dust on the telescope mirror or other causes. After answering by clicking a \"yes\" or \"no\" button, the participant can either write a comment or move on to the next detection.      It is not necessary that people know the correct answer every time, said Catalina Sky Survey director Eric Christensen. Rather, the system relies on strength in numbers.\"With enough people participating, you can establish a general consensus, so there's less margin of error,\" Christensen said.The Catalina Sky Survey operates up to five large, powerful telescopes each night in their quest to keep track of over 1 million lumps of flying rock with diameters ranging from the length of a school bus to the width of Arizona. Initially, the images in the portal will come from their G96 telescope atop Mount Lemmon, just north of Tucson. The diameter of the telescope's primary mirror is approximately 5 feet, and it can usually survey the whole Northern Hemisphere night sky in about a month.\"The number of asteroids we detect per night with our telescope really depends on the weather or where we are in the lunar calendar,\" Christensen said. \"On clear nights, the database matches tens of thousands of candidates to known asteroids based on their motion, speed and position in the sky.\"While the lab's software detects and records all asteroid sightings, Catalina Sky Survey is a NASA-funded project with the mission of specifically tracking and discovering near-Earth objects, or NEOs. NEOs are asteroids that have strayed from the flock of space rocks plodding around the sun in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Their new orbits take them much closer to Earth, and some pose a potential threat if their orbit crosses that of Earth.                Graph showing the amount of near-Earth asteroids discovered over time. Most notably, the current total of almost 32,000 asteroids is at least triple the amount that had been detected ten years ago. Catalina Sky Survey alone has discovered over 14,400 near-Earth asteroids, including 1,200 in the past year. Credit: Alan Chamberlin/JPL-Caltech             More than 14,400 NEOs in the past 30 years\u2014almost half of the entire known population of nearly 32,000\u2014have been discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey. Of those, 1,200 were found just in the past year.\"We are most interested in candidates that are moving fast with an unknown identity because they are most likely to be NEOs,\" Fuls said. \"Because NEOs are closer to us, they appear to move faster and in somewhat random directions from our viewpoint compared to main belt asteroids.\"The process of spotting a new NEO and reporting it is time sensitive, and astronomers can lose track of them if there is no immediate follow-up on their discovery. That's because NEOs have highly elliptical orbits that only bring them close to Earth every three or four years. Plus, some smaller NEOs can only be detected if they are passing near Earth.\"NEOs move so erratically that it's easy to miss them,\" Christensen said. \"We try not to filter out false detections too aggressively because this could also filter out some NEOs.\"Currently, the asteroid-tracking telescope on Mount Lemmon is set up to take about 1,000 images per night. Afterwards, sensitive software ranks detected moving objects from most to least likely to be an asteroid. The final step is for a human observer to analyze the detections that the software identified.\"A human can only process so many images a night,\" said Fuls, explaining that while the software flags many possible objects, the researchers don't have the time and resources to look through everything that was picked up. \"We are missing a certain number of objects because they simply didn't rank high enough in the algorithm.\"That is where a Zooniverse account comes in handy, as \"citizen scientists\" peek through sky photos that the software flagged but weren't obvious enough to make the cut. For each set of images, a participant must decide: Did the software pick up on a never-before seen space object or did it just get confused by the flickering stars?Already, three citizen scientists have discovered 64 possible candidates for unknown asteroids during the testing phase of the web portal.\"We've sent these detections off to the Minor Planet Center as potential new discoveries, and most of these objects have not yet been linked to any object that has been detected before,\" Fuls said. \"We anticipate that there will be many more discoveries like that going forward.\"The Catalina Sky Survey astronomers plan to release new data into the interface every day after their scheduled nighttime viewing session.\"The observations made by these citizen scientists may not always be of a never-before-detected object,\" Christensen said. \"But they may still be key observations that allow the Minor Planet Center to nail down the identity of something that, until now, was just a candidate.\"To keep prospective asteroid hunters on their toes, Fuls said, he and his colleagues will throw pictures of already known objects into the mix to test people's ability to identify real objects and keep them engaged.\"Even when you're at the telescope, you perk up when you see one of those,\" Fuls said. \"You don't want it to be mindless and boring.\" Provided byUniversity of ArizonaCitation:Astronomers want your help hunting for asteroids (2023, May 17)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-astronomers-asteroids.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Imagine an Earth-sized planet that's not at all Earth-like. Half this world is locked in permanent daytime, the other half in permanent night, and it's carpeted with active volcanoes. Astronomers have discovered that planet.          The planet, named LP 791-18d, orbits a small red dwarf star about 90 light years away. Volcanic activity makes the discovery particularly notable for astronomers because volcanism facilitates interaction between a world's interior and its exterior.\"Why is volcanism important? It is the major source contributing to a planetary atmosphere, and with an atmosphere you could have surface liquid water\u2014a requirement for sustaining life as we know it,\" said UC Riverside astrophysicist Stephen Kane.Astronomers already knew about two other worlds in this star system, LP 791-18b and c. The outer planet, c, is about 2.5 times Earth's size, and nearly nine times its mass.During each orbit around the star, planets c and d pass very close to each other. As they do, c's massive size produces a gravitational tug that makes planet d's orbit more elliptical, rather than perfectly circular. These deformations to the orbit create friction that heats the planet's interior, producing volcanic activity at the surface.Researchers found the planet using data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, TESS, and the retired Spitzer Space Telescope. Kane was part of the team that did the original TESS observations, and he co-authored a paper about the newly discovered planet published in the scientific journal Nature.Another key feature of the planet, as described in the paper, is the fact that it does not rotate.\"LP 791-18d is tidally locked, which means the same side constantly faces its star,\" said Bj\u00f6rn Benneke, corresponding co-author of the paper and astronomy professor at the Trottier Institute for Research on Exoplanets, based at the University of Montreal.\"The day side would probably be too hot for liquid water to exist on the surface. But the amount of volcanic activity we suspect occurs all over the planet could sustain an atmosphere, which may allow water to condense on the night side,\" Benneke said.Though the presence of so many constantly erupting volcanoes would likely make the planet uninhabitable, their presence offers new information about evolution.\"A big question in astrobiology, the field that broadly studies the origins of life on Earth and beyond, is if tectonic or volcanic activity is necessary for life,\" said Jessie Christiansen, paper co-author and California Institute of Technology research scientist.\"In addition to potentially providing an atmosphere, these processes could churn up materials that would otherwise sink down and get trapped in the crust, including those we think are important for life, like carbon,\" Christiansen said.The recent discovery of active volcanoes on Venus also shows that planets of Earth's size can continue adding to their atmospheres, with or without plate tectonics.The main constituents of volcanic emissions are carbon dioxide and water vapor, greenhouse gases that can help keep a planet warm. \"On Venus, volcanic carbon dioxide stayed in the atmosphere, pushing the planet into a runaway greenhouse state,\" Kane said.\"Today, surface temperatures on Venus are more than 850 degrees Fahrenheit\u2014as hot as a wood-fired pizza oven\u2014and odds of life there are slim. But it may not always have been that way,\" he said.\"Volcanoes might be a big piece of the puzzle about what actually happened on Venus. Planets like LP 791-18d can shed important insights into how volcanoes shape planetary environments with time, including those of Venus and Earth.\" More information:Bj\u00f6rn Benneke, A temperate Earth-sized planet with tidal heating transiting an M6 star, Nature (2023).

Strong emission lines of helium and the first detection of such a supernova in radio waves show that the exploding white dwarf star had a helium-rich companion.          Supernovae of Type Ia are important for astronomers since they are used to measure the expansion of the universe. However, the origin of these explosions has remained an open question.

  "text": "The first results from the James Webb Space Telescope have hinted at galaxies so early and so massive that they are in tension with our understanding of the formation of structure in the universe. Various explanations have been proposed that may alleviate this tension. But now a new study from the Cosmic Dawn Center suggests an effect which has never before been studied at such early epochs, indicating that the galaxies may be even more massive.          If you have been following the first results from the James Webb Space Telescope, you have probably heard about the paramount issue with the observations of the earliest galaxies: They are too big.From a few days after the release of the first images, and repeatedly through the coming months, new reports of ever-more distant galaxies appeared. Disturbingly, several of the galaxies seemed to be \"too massive.\"From our currently accepted concordance model of the structure and evolution of the universe, the so-called \u039bCDM model, they simply shouldn't have had the time to form so many stars.Although \u039bCDM is not a holy indestructible grail, there are many reasons to wait claiming a paradigm shift: The measured epochs at which we see the galaxies could be underestimated.Their stellar masses could be overestimated. Or we could just have been lucky and somehow have discovered the most massive of the galaxies at that time.A closer lookBut now Clara Gim\u00e9nez Arteaga, Ph.D. student at the Cosmic Dawn Center, proposes an effect that could further increase the tension.In essence, a galaxy's stellar mass is estimated by measuring the amount of light emitted by the galaxy, and calculating how many stars are needed to emit this amount. The usual approach is to consider the combined light from the whole galaxy.However, taking a closer look at a sample of five galaxies, observed with James Webb, Gim\u00e9nez Arteaga found that if the galaxy is regarded not as one big blob of stars, but as an entity build up of multiple clumps, a different picture emerges.\"We used the standard procedure to calculate stellar masses from the images that James Webb has taken, but on a pixel-by-pixel basis rather than looking at the whole galaxy,\" says Gim\u00e9nez Arteaga.\"In principle, one might expect the results to be the same: Adding the light from all pixels and finding the total stellar mass, versus calculating the mass of each pixel and adding all individual stellar masses. But they're not.\"In fact the inferred stellar masses now turned out to be up to ten times larger.The figure below shows the five galaxies with their stellar masses determined by both ways. If the two different approaches agreed, all galaxies would lie along the slanted line named \"The same.\" But they all lie above this line.                The five galaxies placed in a diagram that shows both the stellar mass inferred in the \u201cusual\u201d way (blue numbers) and Clara Gim\u00e9nez-Arteaga\u2019s pixel-by-pixel method (red numbers). In all cases, the masses found using the pixel-by-pixel method are larger. Credit: Gim\u00e9nez-Arteaga et al. (2023), Peter Laursen (Cosmic Dawn Center)             OutshinedSo what is the reason that the stellar masses turn out to be so much larger?Gim\u00e9nez Arteaga explains, \"Stellar populations are a mixture of small and faint stars on one hand, and bright, massive stars on the other hand. If we just look at the combined light, the bright stars will tend to completely outshine the faint stars, leaving them unnoticed. Our analysis shows that bright, star-forming clumps may dominate the total light, but the bulk of the mass is found in smaller stars.\"Stellar mass is one of the main properties used to characterize a galaxy, and Gim\u00e9nez-Arteaga's result highlights the importance of being able to resolve the galaxies.But for the most distant and faint ones, this is not always possible. The effect has been studied before, but only at much later epochs in the history of the universe.The next step is therefore to look for signatures that does not require the high resolution, and which correlate with the \"true\" stellar mass.\"Other studies at much later epochs have also found this discrepancy. If we can determine how common and severe the effect is at earlier epochs, and quantify it, we will be closer to inferring robust stellar masses of distant galaxies, which is one of the main current challenges of studying galaxies in the early universe,\" concludes Clara Gim\u00e9nez Arteaga.The study has just been published in The Astrophysical Journal.The \u039bCDM model\"\u039bCDM\"\u2014pronounced \"Lambda-CDM\"\u2014is the moniker given to the best model we have for describing the structure and evolution of our universe. The model is based upon one of the most well-tested theories in physics, the theory of general relativity, which describes how matter affects space, and how space affects matter.In this model, the universe is assumed to consist primarily of an unknown substance known as dark energy, denoted by the Greek letter \u039b, and cold dark matter (CDM), where \"cold\" means that it does not move around too fast.\u039bCDM has been extremely successful in describing and predicting numerous phenomena. But we still do not know what dark matter and energy is, and we know that general relativity, despite its success, is not a complete theory. We therefore do expect \u039bCDM eventually to be expanded or replaced by a better theory.

  "text": "Using the MeerKAT radio telescope, European astronomers have serendipitously discovered a new radio nebula during observations of the black hole binary GRS 1915+105. The newfound object, dubbed \"the Mini Mouse,\" is a young radio pulsar escaping its birth site and therefore creating a radio nebula with a cometary-like morphology. The finding was reported in a paper published May 10 on the arXiv preprint server.          Pulsars are highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars emitting a beam of electromagnetic radiation. They are usually detected in the form of short bursts of radio emission; however, some of them are also observed via optical, X-ray and gamma-ray telescopes.A team of astronomers led by Sara Elisa Motta of the Brera Observatory in Italy, has recently performed MeerKAT observations of a black hole binary system known as GRS 1915+105 and its surroundings. During the observational campaign, conducted as part of the ThunderKAT Large Survey Program, they serendipitously spotted a feature that closely resembles \"the Mouse\"\u2014a radio nebula detected in 1987.\"Based on the resemblance with the Mouse, we named the newly identified feature in the GRS 1915+105 field 'the Mini Mouse,'\" the researchers explained.The observations found that the Mini Mouse radio nebula is produced by the supersonic pulsar PSR J1914+1054g (or J1914 for short), recently discovered by MeerKAT, escaping the location of its birth. The nebula points back towards the previously unknown faint supernova remnant (SNR) candidate G45.24+0.18. The geometrical center of G45.24+0.18 is located within 30 arcseconds from the extension of the Mini Mouse axis of symmetry, and 12 arcminutes away from the head of the nebula.The pulsar J1914 has a spin period of approximately 138.9 milliseconds and dispersion measure of about 418.9 pc/cm3. Observations show that J1914 has a spin-down luminosity at a level of 400 decillion erg/s and its characteristic age is some 82,000 years. The distance to the pulsar was estimated to be 26,700 light years.The astronomers noted that if the characteristic age of J1914 is close to its actual age, then the projected pulsar velocity should be between 320 and 360 km/s. This would be well within the kick velocity distribution for young, isolated pulsars, centered at approximately 300 km/s, with a dispersion of approximately 190 km/s.\"If the connection between J1914 and the faint SNR is correct, then we may have a faint, fast-spinning, distant young pulsar with a high kick velocity, i.e., a member of an under-sampled population, which could help extrapolating the local young pulsar velocity distribution to the wider Galactic one,\" the researchers concluded.Summing up the results, the authors of the paper underlined that Mini Mouse is the fourth case of a bow shock associated with an escaping pulsar, for which both the pulsar signal and the SNR associated with its birth have been observed.

  "text": "The James Webb Space Telescope has helped astronomers detect the first chemical signs of supermassive stars, \"celestial monsters\" blazing with the brightness of millions of Suns in the early universe.          So far, the largest stars observed anywhere have a mass of around 300 times that of our Sun.But the supermassive star described in a new study has an estimated mass of 5,000 to 10,000 Suns.The team of European researchers behind the study previously theorized the existence of supermassive stars in 2018 in an attempt to explain one of the great mysteries of astronomy.For decades, astronomers have been baffled by the huge diversity in the composition of different stars packed into what are called globular clusters.The clusters, which are mostly very old, can contain millions of stars in a relatively small space.Advances in astronomy have revealed an increasing number of globular clusters, which are thought to be a missing link between the universe's first stars and first galaxies.Our Milky Way galaxy, which has more than 100 billion stars, has around 180 globular clusters.But the question remains: Why do the stars in these clusters have such a variety of chemical elements, despite presumably all being born around the same time, from the same cloud of gas?Rampaging 'seed star'Many of the stars have elements that would require colossal amounts of heat to produce, such as aluminum which would need a temperature of up to 70 million degrees Celsius.That is far above the temperature that the stars are thought to get up to at their core, around the 15-20 million Celsius mark which is similar to the Sun.So the researchers came up with a possible solution: a rampaging supermassive star shooting out chemical \"pollution\".They theorize that these huge stars are born from successive collisions in the tightly packed globular clusters.Corinne Charbonnel, an astrophysicist at the University of Geneva and lead author of the study, told AFP that \"a kind of seed star would engulf more and more stars\".It would eventually become \"like a huge nuclear reactor, continuously feeding on matter, which will eject out a lot of it,\" she added.This discarded \"pollution\" will in turn feed young forming stars, giving them a greater variety of chemicals the closer they are to the supermassive star, she added.But the team still needed observations to back up their theory.'Like finding a bone'They found them in the galaxy GN-z11, which is more than 13 billion light years away\u2014the light we see from it comes from just 440 million years after the Big Bang.It was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2015, and until recently held the record of oldest observed galaxy.This made it an obvious early target for Hubble's successor as most powerful space telescope, the James Webb, which started releasing its first observations last year.Webb offered up two new clues: the incredible density of stars in globular clusters and\u2014most crucially\u2014the presence of lots of nitrogen.It takes truly extreme temperatures to make nitrogen, which the researchers believe could only be produced by a supermassive star.\"Thanks to the data collected by the James Webb Space Telescope, we believe we have found a first clue of the presence of these extraordinary stars,\" Charbonnel said in a statement, which also called the stars \"celestial monsters\".If the team's theory was previously \"a sort of footprint of our supermassive star, this is a bit like finding a bone,\" Charbonnel said.\"We are speculating about the head of the beast behind all this,\" she added.But there is little hope of ever directly observing this beast.The scientists estimate that the life expectancy of supermassive stars is only around two million years\u2014a blink of an eye in the cosmic time scale.However they suspect that globular clusters were around until roughly two billion years ago, and they could yet reveal more traces of the supermassive stars they may have once hosted.The study was published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics this month.

On Tuesday, May 16, at 9:44 p.m. PDT (Wednesday, May 17, at 12:44 a.m. EDT), the CubeSat will pass about 40,000 miles (65,000 kilometers) from our planet's surface.          NASA's Eyes on the Solar System 3D visualization tool will track the tiny spacecraft in real time, giving users a front-row seat to the flyby. (The tool also provides plenty of information about the spacecraft, including its orbit and forthcoming deep space voyage, as well.) In addition, the CubeSat may be within reach of amateur astronomers' telescopes in the Southern Hemisphere.\"As Lunar Flashlight zooms by, it may reflect enough sunlight from its solar panels that it could be seen through a modest telescope,\" said Barbara Cohen, Lunar Flashlight principal investigator at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"Depending on its orientation and position it could be up to a magnitude 5 or 6 moving dot.\"While still tens of thousands of miles away, the sunlight bouncing off the CubeSat's solar panels may be visible for those with clear, dark skies. The brightness of an astronomical object can be measured as apparent magnitude. As an object of magnitude 5 or 6, the CubeSat may be visible to backyard telescopes when it passes at its closest point over the east coast of Brazil. Observers should use NASA Horizons to check where in the sky Lunar Flashlight will be.After launch on Dec. 11, Lunar Flashlight was sent on a long, looping path, far beyond Earth orbit. Now it has returned to the proximity of our planet, after being pulled back by the combined gravity of Earth and the moon.The spacecraft was designed to test new technologies and address knowledge gaps by exploring permanently shadowed craters on the moon's South Pole. But soon after Lunar Flashlight launched, its operations team discovered that the CubeSat's four thrusters were underperforming. After months of troubleshooting to remedy the situation, time ran out for the spacecraft to make critical maneuvers that would have put it in orbit around Earth with monthly flybys of the moon's South Pole.When it became clear that Lunar Flashlight couldn't get into the required orbit for lunar observations, NASA called an end to the rest of its mission. The spacecraft's other systems are functioning well and it remains in contact with mission operators. NASA is now weighing options for Lunar Flashlight's future.After passing Earth, the CubeSat will continue into an orbit around the sun. Lunar Flashlight's orbit will bring it close to Earth once more in November 2037.

  "text": "The BlackGEM array, consisting of three new telescopes located at ESO's La Silla Observatory, has begun operations. The telescopes will scan the southern sky to hunt down the cosmic events that produce gravitational waves, such as the mergers of neutron stars and black holes.          Some cataclysmic events in the universe, such as the collision of black holes or neutron stars, create gravitational waves, ripples in the structure of time and space. Observatories like the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Virgo Interferometer are designed to detect these ripples.But they cannot pinpoint their origin very accurately nor see the fleeting light that results from the collisions between neutron stars and black holes. BlackGEM is dedicated to quickly scanning large areas of the sky to precisely hunt down gravitational-wave sources using visible light.\"With BlackGEM we aim to scale up the study of cosmic events with both gravitational waves and visible light,\" says Paul Groot of Radboud University in the Netherlands, the project's Principal Investigator. \"The combination of the two tells us much more about these events than just one or the other.\"By detecting both gravitational waves and their visible counterparts, astronomers can confirm the nature of gravitational-wave sources and determine their precise locations. Using visible light also allows for detailed observations of the processes that occur in these mergers, such as the formation of heavy elements like gold and platinum.To date, however, only one visible counterpart to a gravitational-wave source has ever been detected. Furthermore, even the most advanced gravitational-wave detectors such as LIGO or Virgo cannot precisely identify their sources; at best, they can narrow the location of a source down to an area of approximately 400 full moons in the sky. BlackGEM will efficiently scan such large regions at high enough resolution to consistently locate gravitational-wave sources using visible light.BlackGEM's three constituent telescopes were built by a consortium of universities: Radboud University, the Netherlands Research School for Astronomy, and KU Leuven in Belgium. The telescopes are each 65 centimeters in diameter and can investigate different areas of the sky simultaneously; the collaboration eventually aims to expand the array to 15 telescopes, improving its scanning coverage even more. BlackGEM is hosted at ESO's La Silla Observatory in Chile, making it the first array of its kind in the southern hemisphere.\"Despite the modest 65-centimeter primary mirror, we go as deep as some projects with much bigger mirrors, because we take full advantage of the excellent observing conditions at La Silla,\" says Groot.Once BlackGEM precisely identifies a source of gravitational waves, larger telescopes such as ESO's Very Large Telescope or the future ESO Extremely Large Telescope can carry out detailed follow-up observations, which will help to shed light on some of the most extreme events in the cosmos.In addition to its search for the optical counterparts to gravitational waves, BlackGEM will also perform surveys of the southern sky. Its operations are fully automated, meaning the array can quickly find and observe 'transient' astronomical events, which appear suddenly and quickly fade out of view. This will give astronomers deeper insight into short-lived astronomical phenomena such as supernovae, the huge explosions that mark the end of a massive star's life.\"Thanks to BlackGEM, La Silla now has the potential to become a major contributor to transient research,\" says Ivo Saviane, site manager at ESO's La Silla Observatory. \"We expect to see many outstanding results contributed by this project, which will expand the reach of the site for both the scientific community and the public at large.\" Provided byESOCitation:BlackGEM telescopes begin hunt for gravitational-wave sources at ESO's La Silla Observatory (2023, May 16)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-blackgem-telescopes-gravitational-wave-sources-eso.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_squad": " Christiaan Huygens",
  "text": "Saturn's rings are one of the jewels of the solar system, but it seems that their time is short and their existence fleeting.          A new study suggests the rings are between 400 million and 100 million years old\u2014a fraction of the age of the solar system. This means we are just lucky to be living in an age when the giant planet has its magnificent rings. Research also reveals that they could be gone in another 100 million years.The rings were first observed in 1610 by the astronomer Galileo Galilei who, owing to the resolution limits of his telescope, initially described them as two smaller planets on each side of Saturn's main orb, apparently in physical contact with it.In 1659, the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens published Systema Saturnium, in which he became the first to describe them as a thin, flat ring system that was not touching the planet.He also showed how their appearance, as viewed from Earth, changes as the two planets orbit the Sun and why they seemingly disappear at certain times. This is due to their viewing geometry being such that we on Earth periodically see them edge-on.The rings are visible to anyone with a decent pair of binoculars or a modest back garden telescope. Cast white against the pale yellow orb of Saturn, the rings are composed almost entirely of billions of particles of water ice, which shine by scattering sunlight.                A page from the System Saturnium published in 1659. Credit: US Library of Congress             Amid this icy material are deposits of darker, dusty stuff. In space science, \"dust\" usually refers to tiny grains of rocky, metallic, or carbon-rich material that is noticeably darker than ice. It is also collectively referred to as micrometeoroids. These grains permeate the solar system.Occasionally, you can see them entering the Earth's atmosphere at night as shooting stars. The gravitational fields of the planets have the effect of magnifying or focusing this dusty, planetary \"in-fall\".Over time, this in-fall adds mass to a planet and alters its chemical composition. Saturn is a massive gas giant planet with a radius of some 60,000km, about 9.5 times that of Earth, and a mass of about 95 times that of Earth. This means it has a very large \"gravity well\" (the gravitational field surrounding a body in space) that is very effective at funneling the dusty grains towards Saturn.      Collision courseThe rings extend from some 2,000km above Saturn's cloud tops to about 80,000km away, occupying a large area of space. When in-falling dust passes through, it can collide with icy particles in the rings. Over time, the dust gradually darkens the rings and adds to their mass.Cassini-Huygens was a robotic spacecraft launched in 1997. It reached Saturn in 2004 and entered orbit around the planet, where it stayed until the end of the mission in 2017. One of the instruments aboard was the Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA).                A view of Saturn\u2019s northern hemisphere in 2016. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute             Using data from the CDA, the authors in the new paper compared the current dust counts in space around Saturn with the estimated mass of dark dusty material in the rings. They found that the rings are no older than 400 million years and may be as young as 100 million years. These may seem like lengthy time scales, but they are less than one-tenth of the 4.5 billion-year age of the solar system.This also means that the rings did not form at the same time as Saturn or the other planets. They are, cosmologically speaking, a recent addition to the solar system. For over 90% of Saturn's existence, they were not present.Death StarThis leads to another mystery: how did the rings first form, given that all of the solar system's major planets and moons formed much earlier? The total mass of the rings is estimated to be about half as much as one of Saturn's smaller icy moons, many of which exhibit enormous impact features on their surfaces.One in particular, the little moon Mimas, which is nicknamed the Death Star, has a 130km-wide impact crater called Herschel on its surface.This is by no means the largest crater in the solar system. However, Mimas is only about 400km across, so this impact would not have needed much more energy to obliterate the moon. Mimas is made of water-ice, just like the rings, so it's possible that the rings were formed from just such a cataclysmic impact.                Saturn\u2019s moon Mimas, showing Herschel crater. Credit: NASA/JPL/SSI             Ring rainHowever they formed, the future of Saturn's rings is in little doubt. The impact of the dust grains against the icy particles happens at very high velocities, leading to tiny fragments of ice and dust getting chipped away from their parent particles.Ultra-violet light from the Sun causes these fragments to become electrically charged via the photo-electric effect. Like the Earth, Saturn has a magnetic field, and once charged, these tiny icy fragments are released from the ring system and trapped by the planet's magnetic field.In concert with the gravity of the giant planet, they are then funneled down into Saturn's atmosphere. This \"ring rain\" was first observed from afar by the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft during their brief Saturn flybys in the early 1980s.In a more recent paper from 2018 scientists used dust counts, again from the CDA, as Cassini flew between the rings and Saturn's cloud tops, to work out how much ice and dust is lost from the rings over time. This study demonstrated that about one Olympic-sized swimming pool of mass from the rings is lost into Saturn's atmosphere every half-hour.This flow rate was used to estimate that, given their current mass, the rings will probably be gone in as little as 100 million years. These beautiful rings have a turbulent history, and unless they are somehow replenished, they will be gobbled up by Saturn.

  "text": "Six years ago the Cassini spacecraft, which had spent nearly two decades in orbit around Saturn, finished its mission with a grand finale, plunging itself into the depths of Saturn's atmosphere. Those last few orbits and the final plunge revealed a wealth of information about Saturn's interior. A team of astronomers have collected all of the available data and are now painting a portrait of the interior of the solar system's second largest planet.          One of the key questions astronomers have asked of the nature of Saturn is the characteristics of its deep interior and potential core. With remote observations we can only access the visible surface of the planet, which only accounts for the uppermost reaches of its atmosphere. However, we have several techniques available to probe the planet's deep interior. First we have the rings themselves. All the trillions of particles that make up the rings respond to the gravity of Saturn. Different compositions of the interior and different mixtures of that material will subtly alter the orbital motions of the ring particles. By carefully studying how the rings orbit the planet, we can develop models of Saturn's interior.Most importantly we have Cassini itself. As it looped around the world in its last few orbits it gathered an enormous amount of data about the gravitational environment it experienced. And finally during its fatal plunge we got our first direct measurements of the upper reaches of Saturn's atmosphere.Recently astronomers have put all together all that data to give us a hazy but compelling portrait of the planet's interior, published as a pre-print on arXiv. All the available evidence indicates that the planet's atmosphere undergoes differential rotation down to a depth of 10,000 km, which is roughly 1/6 of the entire planet's radius. This means that the atmosphere near the equator of Saturn moves faster than the atmosphere near the pole, matching what we see on the surface. Deep within Saturn, however, the differential rotation gives way to a unified rotation rate of 10 hours and 33 minutes\u2014that is the true \"day\" length on that planet.It appears that Saturn does have a core composed of a central concentration of heavy elements. This core weighs somewhere between 12 and 20 times the mass of the Earth. However, this core is not compact like the Earth itself, but instead slowly diffuses and mixes with the hydrogen and helium atmosphere that envelops it. That gives a rough boundary of the core of somewhere around half the radius of Saturn.Astronomers still do not fully understand how Saturn generates all of its heat. One possible mechanism is that helium condenses out of the upper atmosphere and sinks to lower depths, serving as a way to transfer energy from the core to the upper atmosphere, but this is not yet proven.The astronomers behind the study call for future missions to Saturn, especially ones designed to pierce the upper atmosphere and sink as deep into the planet as possible so that we can get a clearer picture.

  "text": "This week, the Australian Space Summit is celebrating some of our nation's strengths and achievements in the space sector. But it's taking place under the shadow of significant cuts to space technology investment announced in last week's federal budget.          Space technologies play a critical role in responding to many national priorities, such as climate and disaster resilience, connecting regional Australians, contributing to regional security and driving economic growth. Yet, the sector suffers from a branding issue\u2014most people think of rockets and astronauts, rather than the satellites we depend on globally.This leads to a misunderstanding in government of the importance of space technologies to the issues we are seeking to solve. It also makes it harder to recruit talented people to the field.So, how do we find enough people with the skills necessary to grow this critical technology sector?Why diversity and inclusivity matterThe answer is placing a new priority on talent recruitment and expanding diversity and inclusivity in the space sector.The space sector needs workers from all different backgrounds and disciplines, but is struggling to attract a diverse talent pool. This is due to a misconception that space only offers STEM-related jobs, as well as the overwhelmingly white and male make-up of the space industry, government and academia.This not only impacts the workforce pipeline, but also potentially the sector's funding, due to a limited view of what kinds of solutions the space sector can provide to society's biggest challenges.This is an urgent public relations issue for the space sector. It needs to rethink how it markets itself to the public to better recruit for a myriad of positions in fields like space law, policy, technology governance, social anthropology and archaeology, business, arts, communications and more.The sector also needs to make diversity a priority. Currently, just one in five employees in the space industry are women. First Nations Australians also continue to be sidelined, despite the fact the majority of our ground-based infrastructure for space systems is on Indigenous lands.We need greater inclusivity of perspectives from people of diverse genders, sexual orientations and ethnic and linguistic backgrounds, as well as people with disability. Research shows diverse and inclusive groups lead to greater trust, democracy and innovation, less \"group think\", more positive work environments and greater employee retention.Additionally, greater diversity can make it easier to tell the story of why space technologies matter to society. This would help in terms of government funding and the industry's ability to punch above its weight globally.      A national conference on diversity in spaceLast month, we brought together over 200 experts from the space industry, government, academia and the community to discuss these issues at the first-ever national conference on gender equality and diversity in space.The participants agreed that diversity is an overlooked opportunity for the space sector. Many of the challenges facing the sector could be addressed by recruiting from a more diverse talent pool and ensuring diverse perspectives are being incorporated into technology design and solutions.These are some of our key recommendations:(1) Enhance workplace conditions and enact informal networksPolicy changes can help with diversity recruitment, such as tackling poor organizational cultures, offering equitable leave policies and improving current promotion and hiring policies.But informal networks are important, too. There are networks for women in space in various countries, such as the US and New Zealand, which have proven to be vital in developing a more diverse workforce. A new Women in Space Network is soon to be launched in Australia.(2) Don't just pay lip service to diversityDiversity must be placed at the center of programs and policies in both the space sector and in governments at the federal and state/territory level. The space sector must also do a better job of explaining the importance of its work to government agencies.(3) Establish diversity procurement policiesThis includes minimum targets to support women-owned and First Nations-owned enterprises in the space sector and giving preference to space businesses that demonstrate improvements to diversity in their workforce.Australia risks falling behindIn 2025, Australia will host the International Astronautical Conference, the largest annual conference for the space industry in the world. This is a great opportunity to showcase our leadership in promoting a values-based, diverse, equitable and sustainable space sector.Yet, without tangible action now, Australia's space sector risks falling further behind our international counterparts.The Australian Space Agency is currently working with a number of organizations, including the Global Institute for Women's Leadership, the ANU Institute for Space and the Australian Center for Space Governance, to develop our own policy for diversity in the space sector.This is a step in the right direction, particularly in the wake of the latest budget. But the industry also needs to step up with data transparency on diversity, as well as tangible commitments and actions.To this end, we are conducting research on improving diversity in the space sector. We are inviting anyone in government, industry and academic roles to take part in a survey to describe their experiences of inclusion, diversity, equality and access in their jobs. This input will contribute to Australia's statement on diversity and inclusivity in the space sector.

  "text": "The sun's rotation produces changes in its magnetic field, which flips completely every 11 years or so, triggering a phase of intense activity. Solar flares\u2014huge eruptions from the surface of the sun lasting minutes or hours\u2014emit intense bursts of particles and high levels of electromagnetic radiation. The release of energy during solar flares heats the chromosphere, causing almost full ionization of the atomic hydrogen present in the region.          The chromosphere is a thin layer of plasma that lies at least 2,000 km above the sun's visible surface (the photosphere) and below the corona (the sun's upper atmosphere). The plasma is very dense, and the hydrogen recombines at a very high rate, resulting in a recurring process of ionization and hydrogen recombination that produces a characteristic type of radiation emission in the ultraviolet band known as the Lyman Continuum (LyC) in memory of American physicist Theodore Lyman IV (1874-1954).Theoretical descriptions suggest the LyC's \"color temperature\" could be associated with the temperature of the plasma that produces the flare, and color temperature could therefore be used to determine plasma temperature during solar storms.A new study has simulated emissions from dozens of different solar flares and confirmed the link between the LyC's color temperature and the plasma temperature in the region from which the flare erupts. It also confirms that a local thermodynamic equilibrium occurs in the region between the plasma and the photons in the LyC. An article on the study is published in The Astrophysical Journal.The penultimate author of the article is Paulo Jos\u00e9 de Aguiar Sim\u00f5es, a professor at Mackenzie Presbyterian University's School of Engineering (EE-UPM) in S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil. \"We show that the LyC's intensity increases significantly during solar flares and that analysis of the Lyman spectrum really can be used for diagnosis of the plasma,\" said Sim\u00f5es, who is also a researcher at the Mackenzie Radio Astronomy and Astrophysics Center (CRAAM).The simulations corroborated an important result obtained at the Solar Dynamics Laboratory by Argentinian astronomer Marcos Machado showing that the color temperature, which in quiet periods is in the region of 9,000 Kelvin (K), rises to 12,000-16,000 K during flares.The article in which he reported this result and of which Sim\u00f5es was also a co-author, was the last published by Machado. A world-renowned expert on the sun, he died in 2018 while the article was being peer-reviewed.      Solar dynamicsHere it is worth recalling a little of what is known about the sun's structure and dynamics. The huge amount of energy that provides Earth with light and heat is mainly generated by conversion of hydrogen into helium in a process of nuclear fusion that takes place deep inside the star. This vast region is not directly observable because light does not cross the sun's \"surface\", which is actually the photosphere.\"We can observe the region above the surface directly. The first layer, which extends up to an altitude of about 500 km, is the photosphere, with a temperature of around 5,800 K. This is where we see sunspots, in places where the magnetic fields that emerge from the sun inhibit convection and keep the plasma relatively cool, producing these darker areas we call sunspots,\" Sim\u00f5es explained.Above the photosphere, the chromosphere extends for some 2,000 km. \"The temperature of this layer is higher, exceeding 10,000 K, and the plasma is less dense. Owing to these characteristics, the atomic hydrogen is partially ionized, keeping protons and electrons separate,\" he said.In a thin transition layer at the top of the chromosphere, the temperature rises sharply to above 1 million K, and plasma density falls by many orders of magnitude. This sudden heating in the passage from chromosphere to corona is a counter-intuitive phenomenon; it would be reasonable to expect the temperature to fall as the distance from the source increases.\"We don't have an explanation yet. Various proposals have been presented by solar physicists, but none has been accepted without reservations by the community,\" Sim\u00f5es said.The corona extends toward the interplanetary medium, without a clear-cut transition region. The sun's magnetic fields exert a strong influence on the corona, structuring the plasma, especially in active regions easily identified in ultraviolet images. Solar flares occur in these active regions.\"In these solar storms, the energy accumulated in the coronal magnetic fields is abruptly released, heating the plasma and accelerating the particles. Electrons, which have less mass, can be accelerated to as much as 30% of the speed of light. Some of these particles, which travel along magnetic lines of force, are ejected into the interplanetary medium. Others go in the opposite direction, from corona to chromosphere, where they collide with the high-density plasma and transfer their energy to the medium. This surplus energy heats the local plasma, causing ionization of the atoms. The dynamics of ionization and recombination gives rise to the Lyman Continuum,\" Simoes said.The spikes in solar activity occur roughly every 11 years. During periods of intense activity, the effects on the Earth are substantial, including more aurora borealis displays, radio communications blackouts, heightened effects of scintillation on GPS signals, and an increase in the drag on satellites, reducing their velocity and hence the altitude of their orbits. These phenomena and the physical properties of the near-Earth interplanetary medium are known as space weather.\"Besides the fundamental knowledge they provide, studies of the physics of solar flares also improve our ability to forecast space weather. These studies walk on two legs: direct observation, and simulations based on computational models. Observational data in the different bands of the electromagnetic spectrum enables us to understand better the evolution of solar flares and the physical properties of the plasma involved in these events. Computational models, such as those used in our study, serve to test hypotheses and verify interpretations of the observations since they give us access to quantities that can't be directly obtained from analysis of observational data,\" Sim\u00f5es said.

  "answer_race": " Saturn's New Moons",
  "question_squad": " How many moons are in the saturnian system?",
  "answer_squad": " 62",
  "text": "The work of an international team of astronomers has resulted in the announcement of 62 new moons of Saturn, catapulting it back into first place of the \"moon race\" around the giant planets of our solar system.          The team is led by Edward Ashton (currently a postdoctoral fellow at Taiwan's Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics) and includes professor Brett Gladman (Department of Physics & Astronomy at the University of British Columbia), Mike Alexandersen (Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics), Jean-Marc Petit (Observatoire de Besancon), and Matthew Beaudoin (University of British Columbia).Over the past two decades, Saturn's surroundings have been repeatedly examined for moons with increasing sensitivity. In this latest study, Dr. Ashton's team used a technique known as \"shift and stack\" in order to find fainter (and thus smaller) saturnian moons. This method has been used for moon searches around Neptune and Uranus, but never for Saturn.Shifting a set of sequential images at the rate that the moon is moving across the sky results in enhancement of the moon's signal when all the data is combined, allowing moons that were too faint to be seen in individual images to become visible in the \"stacked\" image. The team used data taken using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) on top of Mauna Kea, Hawaii between 2019 and 2021. By shifting and stacking many sequential images taken during 3 hour spans, they were able to detect moons of Saturn down to about 2.5 kilometers in diameter.The original discovery search was done in 2019 when Ashton and Beaudoin were students at the University of British Columbia, uncovering the moons in a meticulous search of the deep CFHT imaging acquired that year. But just finding an object close to Saturn on the sky is insufficient to say for certain that it is a moon; it could in principle be an asteroid that just happened to be passing close to the planet (although this is unlikely).To be absolutely sure, the object must be tracked for several years before one can establish that it is certainly orbiting the planet. After painstakingly matching objects detected on different nights over two years, the team has managed to track 63 objects, thus confirming them as new moons. One of the new moons, designated S/2019 S 1, was announced back in 2021, with the rest being announced over the last couple of weeks. Some of the team's linked orbits were identified with past observations from many years ago that briefly glimpsed some of these moons (but were not tracked long enough to establish their orbit around Saturn).      \"Tracking these moons makes me recall playing the kid's game Dot-to-Dot, because we have to connect the various appearances of these moons in our data with a viable orbit,\" explains Edward Ashton, \"but with about 100 different games on the same page and you don't know which dot belongs to which puzzle.\"All of the new moons are in the class of irregular moons, which are thought to be initially captured by their host planet long ago. Irregular moons are characterized by their large, elliptical, and inclined orbits compared to regular moons. The number of known saturnian irregular moons has more than doubled to 121, with 58 previously known before the search began.Including the 24 regular moons, there is now a total of 145 recognized (by the International Astronomical Union) moons orbiting Saturn. The new discoveries have resulted in multiple milestones for the ringed planet. Saturn has not only regained its crown for having the most known moons (overtaking Jupiter with 95 recognized moons), it is also the first planet to have over 100 discovered moons in total.The irregular moons tend to clump together into orbital groups based on the tilt of their orbits. In the saturnian system there are 3 such groups whose names are drawn from different mythologies: there is the Inuit group, the Gallic group, and the much more populated Norse group. For example, three new discoveries fall in the Inuit group: S/2019 S 1, S/2020 S 1 and S/2005 S 4 have very small orbits tilted similarly to that of the previously known larger irregulars Kiviuq and Ijiraq. All of the new moons fall into one of the three known groups, with the Norse group again being the most populated among the new moons. The groups are thought to be the result of collisions, where the current moons in a group are remnants of one or more collisions on the originally-captured moons.A better understanding of the orbital distribution thus provides insight into the collisional history of the irregular moon system of Saturn. Based on their past studies of these moons, this team has suggested that the large number of small moons on retrograde orbits is the result of a relatively recent (in astronomical terms, being in the last 100 million years) disruption of a moderately sized irregular moon that is now broken into the many fragments that are being catalogued in the Norse group.As professor Gladman explains, \"as one pushes to the limit of modern telescopes, we are finding increasing evidence that a moderate-sized moon orbiting backwards around Saturn was blown apart something like 100 million years ago.\" Provided byUniversity of British ColumbiaCitation:Researchers announce 62 new moons of Saturn (2023, May 16)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-moons-saturn.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "An international team of astronomers reports the detection of a new \"super-Earth\" exoplanet using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The newfound alien world, designated TOI-244 b, turns out to have an unusually low density. The finding was reported in a paper published May 8 on the arXiv preprint server.          TESS is conducting a survey of about 200,000 of the brightest stars near the sun with the aim of searching for transiting exoplanets. So far, it has identified nearly 6,600 candidate exoplanets (TESS Objects of Interest, or TOI), of which 331 have been confirmed so far.Now, a group of astronomers led by Amadeo Castro-Gonz\u00e1lez of the Spanish Astrobiology Center in Madrid, Spain, has confirmed another TOI monitored by TESS. They report that a transit signal was detected in the light curve of TOI-244 (also known as GJ 1018)\u2014a nearby bright, early type M-dwarf star of spectral type M2.5 V, nearly half the size and mass of the sun. The planetary nature of this signal was confirmed by radial velocity measurements conducted with the ESPRESSO spectrograph mounted on the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile.\"Based on the transit signal detected from TESS data, we carried out an intensive radial velocity campaign with ESPRESSO in order to confirm its planetary nature, obtain a precise mass measurement, as well as to search for additional planets,\" the researchers wrote.According to the study, TOI-244 b has a radius of 1.52 Earth radii, while its mass is about 2.68 Earth masses, yielding a density at a level of 4.2 g/cm3. The planet orbits its host every 7.4 days, at a distance of about 0.056 AU from it, and its equilibrium temperature is estimated to be some 458 K.Based on the findings, Castro-Gonz\u00e1lez's team classified TOI-244 b as a \"super-Earth.\" Such planets are more massive than Earth but do not exceed the mass of Neptune. Although the term \"super-Earth\" refers only to the mass of the planet, it is also used by astronomers to describe planets bigger than Earth but smaller than the so-called \"mini-Neptunes\" (with radiuses between two to four Earth radii).The results suggest that TOI-244 b is composed of iron and silicates in a proportion similar to that of the Earth. However, the planet is less dense than the majority of super-Earths of its size. The density of TOI-244 b is also below what would be expected for an Earth-like composition.The researchers assume that the low density of TOI-244 b is related to the presence of a significant amount of volatile elements.\"In that sense, we find that atmospheric loss processes may have been very efficient to remove a potential primordial hydrogen envelope, but high mean molecular weight volatiles such as water could have been retained,\" the authors of the paper concluded.The astronomers added that TOI-244 b is an excellent target for future atmospheric studies, due to its unusual properties and the likely presence of an extended atmosphere.

  "text": "A strong quake in the last year of the NASA Mars InSight mission, enabled researchers at ETH Zurich to determine the global thickness and density of the planet's crust. On average, the Martian crust much thicker than the Earth's or the moon's crust, and the planet's main source of heat is radioactive.          After more than three years of daily monitoring and with the power levels decreasing on InSight's seismometer, researchers were rewarded with data from a sizeable Marsquake in May 2022. The surface waves observed from this estimated 4.6 magnitude quake not only traveled from the quake's source to the measuring station, they also continued to travel around the entire planet several times. This data not only provided information about specific areas of Mars, but also enabled a global view of the planet.\"From this quake, the largest quake recorded during the entire InSight mission, we observed surface waves that circled Mars up to three times,\" says Doyeon Kim, seismologist and lead author of a study just published in the journal, Geophysical Research Letters. In order to gain information about the structure that the waves passed through, the researchers measured how fast these waves propagate at different frequencies.These seismic velocities provide insights into the interior structure at different depths. Previously, observed surface waves from the two large meteorite impacts also allowed regional findings along their specific propagation paths. \"Now, we have seismic observations that represent the global structure,\" says Kim.Comparing data from Mars with that of the Earth and the moonCombining their newly obtained results with existing data on the gravity and topography of Mars, the researchers were able to determine the thickness of the Martian crust. It averages 42 to 56 kilometers (26\u201335 miles). On average, the crust is thinnest at the Isidis impact basin at ~10 km (6 miles), and thickest at Tharsis province at ~90 km (56 miles). To put this into perspective, seismic data indicates that the Earth's crust has an average thickness of 21 to 27 kilometers (13\u201317 miles), while the lunar crust, as determined by the Apollo mission seismometers is between 34 and 43 kilometers (21\u201327 miles) thick.\"This means that the Martian crust is much thicker than that of the Earth or the moon,\" says Kim. Generally, smaller planetary bodies in our solar system have a thicker crust than the larger bodies. Kim explains, \"We were fortunate to observe this quake. On Earth, we would have difficulty determining the thickness of the Earth's crust using the same magnitude of quake that occurred on Mars. While Mars is smaller than the Earth, it transports seismic energy more efficiently.\"One of the most important results of this research concerns the difference between the northern and southern hemispheres of Mars. This contrast has been observed for as long as there have been telescopes; it is particularly visible in images from Mars satellites. The northern hemisphere on Mars consists of flat lowlands, while there are high plateaus in the south. The division between northern lowlands and southern highlands is called a Martian dichotomy.      Similar crust density and radioactive heat\"One might think that this difference could be explained by two different rock compositions,\" says Kim. \"One rock would be denser than the other.\" While the composition may be the same in the north and south, the thickness of the crust varies. If the crust is thicker in the south, there would be less dense Martian mantle material underneath it, whereas a thinner crust in the north would have more of this dense, heavier material.Precisely what have the researchers have been able to prove? \"Based on the seismic observations and the gravity data, we show that the density of the crust in the northern lowlands and the southern highlands is similar,\" they write. In contrast, the crust in the southern hemisphere extends to a greater depth than in the northern hemisphere. \"This finding is very exciting and allows an end to a long-standing scientific discussion on the origin and structure of the Martian crust,\" says Kim. After all, analysis of meteorite impacts on Mars last year already provided evidence that the crusts in the north and south are made of the same material.Further conclusions can also be drawn from the thick Martian crust. \"Our study provides how the planet generates its heat and explains Mars' thermal history,\" says Kim. As a single-plate planet, the main source of heat produced in the interior of Mars today is a result of the decay of radioactive elements such as thorium, uranium, and potassium. The study found that 50% to 70% of these heat-producing elements are found in the Martian crust. This high accumulation could explain why there are local regions underneath where melting processes may still be taking place today.

  "answer_squad": " 2,505",
  "text": "NASA's Juno spacecraft will fly past Jupiter's volcanic moon Io on Tuesday, May 16, and then the gas giant itself soon after. The flyby of the Jovian moon will be the closest to date, at an altitude of about 22,060 miles (35,500 kilometers). Now in the third year of its extended mission to investigate the interior of Jupiter, the solar-powered spacecraft will also explore the ring system where some of the gas giant's inner moons reside.          To date, Juno has performed 50 flybys of Jupiter and also collected data during close encounters with three of the four Galilean moons\u2014the icy worlds Europa and Ganymede, and fiery Io.\"Io is the most volcanic celestial body that we know of in our solar system,\" said Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"By observing it over time on multiple passes, we can watch how the volcanoes vary\u2014how often they erupt, how bright and hot they are, whether they are linked to a group or solo, and if the shape of the lava flow changes.\"Slightly larger than Earth's moon, Io is a world in constant torment. Not only is the biggest planet in the solar system forever pulling at it gravitationally, but so are its Galilean siblings\u2014Europa and the biggest moon in the solar system, Ganymede. The result is that Io is continuously stretched and squeezed, actions linked to the creation of the lava seen erupting from its many volcanoes.While Juno was designed to study Jupiter, its many sensors have additionally provided a wealth of data on the planet's moons. Along with its visible light imager JunoCam, the spacecraft's JIRAM (Jovian InfraRed Auroral Mapper), SRU (Stellar Reference Unit), and MWR (Microwave Radiometer) will be studying Io's volcanoes and how volcanic eruptions interact with Jupiter's powerful magnetosphere and auroras.                These infrared views of volcanic activity of Jupiter\u2019s moon Io were collected by the JIRAM (Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper) instrument aboard NASA\u2019s Juno spacecraft during a flyby of the moon on Oct. 16, 2021. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/ASI/INAF/JIRAM             \"We are entering into another amazing part of Juno's mission as we get closer and closer to Io with successive orbits. This 51st orbit will provide our closest look yet at this tortured moon,\" said Bolton. \"Our upcoming flybys in July and October will bring us even closer, leading up to our twin flyby encounters with Io in December of this year and February of next year, when we fly within 1,500 kilometers of its surface. All of these flybys are providing spectacular views of the volcanic activity of this amazing moon. The data should be amazing.\"      A 'half-century' at JupiterDuring its flybys of Jupiter, Juno has zoomed low over the planet's cloud tops\u2014as close as about 2,100 miles (3,400 kilometers). Approaching the planet from over the north pole and exiting over the south during these flybys, the spacecraft uses its instruments to probe beneath the obscuring cloud cover, studying Jupiter's interior and auroras to learn more about the planet's origins, structure, atmosphere, and magnetosphere.Juno has been orbiting Jupiter for more than 2,505 Earth days and flown over 510 million miles (820 million kilometers). The spacecraft arrived at Jupiter on July 4, 2016. The first science flyby occurred 53 days later, and the spacecraft continued with that orbital period until its flyby of Ganymede on June 7, 2021, which reduced its orbital period to 43 days. The Europa flyby on Sept. 29, 2022, reduced the orbital period to 38 days. After the next two Io flybys, on May 16 and July 31, Juno's orbital period will remain fixed at 32 days.\"Io is only one of the celestial bodies which continue to come under Juno's microscope during this extended mission,\" said Juno's acting project manager, Matthew Johnson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"As well as continuously changing our orbit to allow new perspectives of Jupiter and flying low over the nightside of the planet, the spacecraft will also be threading the needle between some of Jupiter's rings to learn more about their origin and composition.\" Provided byNASACitation:NASA's Juno mission nears Jupiter's moon Io (2023, May 15)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-nasa-juno-mission-nears-jupiter.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_squad": " topological solitons",
  "text": "A team of theoretical physicists have discovered a strange structure in space-time that to an outside observer would look exactly like a black hole, but upon closer inspection would be anything but: they would be defects in the very fabric of the universe.          Einstein's general theory of relativity predicts the existence of black holes, formed when giant stars collapse. But that same theory predicts that their centers are singularities, which are points of infinite density. Since we know that infinite densities cannot actually happen in the universe, we take this as a sign that Einstein's theory is incomplete. But after nearly a century of searching for extensions, we have not yet confirmed a better theory of gravity.But we do have candidates, including string theory. In string theory all the particles of the universe are actually microscopic vibrating loops of string. In order to support the wide variety of particles and forces that we observe in the universe, these strings can't just vibrate in our three spatial dimensions. Instead, there have to be extra spatial dimensions that are curled up on themselves into manifolds so small that they escape everyday notice and experimentation.That exotic structure in spacetime gave a team of researchers the tools they needed to identify a new class of object, something that they call a topological soliton. In their analysis they found that these topological solitons are stable defects in space-time itself. They require no matter or other forces to exist\u2014they are as natural to the fabric of space-time as cracks in ice. The research is published in the journal Physical Review D.The researchers studied these solitons by examining the behavior of light that would pass near them. Because they are objects of extreme space-time, they bend space and time around them, which affects the path of light. To a distant observer, these solitons would appear exactly as we predict black holes to appear. They would have shadows, rings of light, the works. Images derived from the Event Horizon Telescope and detected gravitational wave signatures would all behave the same.It's only once you got close would you realize that you are not looking at a black hole. One of the key features of a black hole is its event horizon, an imaginary surface that if you were to cross it you would find yourself unable to escape. Topological solitons, since they are not singularities, do not feature event horizons. So you could in principle go up to a soliton and hold it in your hand, assuming you survived the encounter.These topological solitons are incredibly hypothetical objects, based on our understanding of string theory, which has not yet been proven to be a viable update to our understanding of physics. However, these exotic objects serve as important test studies. If the researchers can discover an important observational difference between topological solitons and traditional black holes, this might pave the way to finding a way to test string theory itself.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the NASA spacecraft mission that studied Saturn's rings?",
  "answer_squad": " Cassini",
  "text": "Saturn's rings are much younger than scientists once thought, according to new research from Indiana University Professor Emeritus of Astronomy Richard Durisen\u2014and they are not here to stay.          For decades, there has been debate about the origin of Saturn's icy rings. But according to two new studies from Durisen, published in Icarus, the rings are no more than a few hundred million years old\u2014much younger than the planet itself, which formed 4.5 billion years ago. In fact, Durisen said the rings may well have formed when dinosaurs were still walking on the Earth.Durisen and co-author Paul Estrada, a research scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley, also concluded that the rings will last only another few hundred million years at most.\"Our inescapable conclusion is that Saturn's rings must be relatively young by astronomical standards, just a few hundred million years old,\" Durisen said. \"If you look at Saturn's satellite system, there are other hints that something dramatic happened there in the last few hundred million years.\"Durisen and Estrada have long argued that Saturn's rings are relatively young, because they expected the rings to be eroded and darkened by the influx of interplanetary meteoroids. However, it wasn't until data was available from NASA's 13-year-long Cassini spacecraft mission\u2014particularly its 2017 Grand Finale, consisting of 22 orbits passing between Saturn and its rings\u2014that they were able to use theoretical models to determine the age and longevity of the rings with confidence by computing how the rings change over long periods of time.Particularly important for their work were Cassini's measurements of the meteoroid influx rate, the mass of the rings and the inflow rate of ring material onto Saturn.The impact of meteoroids not only pollutes the rings, it ultimately leads to ring material drifting inward toward the planet. The theoretical models presented by Durisen and Estrada demonstrate that the rings should be losing mass onto the planet at the prodigious rate of many tons per second that Cassini observed, which means that the remaining lifetime of the rings is only another few hundred million years or so.      For the first time, the detailed computations by Estrada and Durisen combine viscous spreading\u2014due to ring particle interactions\u2014with meteoroid effects in simulations designed to span the full lifetime of a ring system like Saturn's. They demonstrate that meteoroid impacts are what ultimately impose a short lifetime compared with the age of the solar system, given the meteoroid influx rate measured by Cassini.\"We have shown that massive rings like Saturn's do not last long,\" Estrada said. \"One can speculate that the relatively puny rings around the other ice and gas giants in our solar system are left-over remnants of rings that were once massive like Saturn's. Maybe some time in the not-so-distant future, astronomically speaking, after Saturn's rings are ground down, they will look more like the sparse rings of Uranus.\"Durisen's decades-long research career centered mostly on the evolution and stability of rotating astrophysical systems of all types, from planets to galaxies. During the two decades before his retirement in 2010, he worked primarily on protoplanetary disks\u2014the rotating disks of gas surrounding new stars from which planets can form. But his interest in Saturn's rings began as a postdoctoral fellow at NASA Ames in the 1970s, and he has continued to study them ever since.\"In studying the universe, we often think about origins\u2014origins of galaxies, stars and planets,\" Durisen said. \"But planets are incredibly active and diverse systems where new things happen all the time. If Saturn's rings are not as old as the planet, that means something happened in order to form their incredible structure, and that is very exciting to study.\"Durisen is interested to see what future space missions discover about Saturn's system. Though the planet, composed mostly of helium and hydrogen, probably cannot support life, the conditions on some of its moons may have supported it in the past or even now, he said.\"If we can discover what happened in that system a few hundred million years ago to form the rings, we may just end up discovering why Saturn's moon Enceladus is spewing out from its deep ocean plumes of water, ice and even organic material,\" Durisen said. \"We may perhaps even end up finding the building blocks of life itself on Enceladus.\" More information:Richard H.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards the discovery of a boson star?",
  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the most exotic possibility?",
  "answer_squad": " boson star",
  "text": "A team of astronomers has claimed that observations of a sun-like star orbiting a small black hole might actually be the indication of something far more exotic\u2014the existence of a boson star, a star composed entirely of dark matter.          The Gaia survey, led by the European Space Agency, provided detailed maps of more than a billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy. While almost all of those stars behaved as expected, there were some surprises. For example, one star in particular was seen orbiting a dark companion.The star itself was fairly typical, weighing in at 0.93 solar masses and with roughly the same chemical abundance as our own sun. However, its companion did not emit any radiation at all. Most astronomers suspect that it was a black hole, which could easily explain the observational result.But, in a paper recently published on the arXiv preprint server, a team of astronomers have pointed out that this particular setup is highly unusual. Black holes form from the deaths of very massive stars, and it's unlikely for a star like our sun to form as part of a binary pair with such a massive star. The scenario requires so much fine tuning, the authors argue, that we should be open to considering other possibilities.Perhaps the most exotic possibility is that the dark companion is not a black hole but a boson star. Boson stars are a consequence of a hypothetical form of dark matter. Dark matter itself comprises over 80% of all the mass of every galaxy and is made of some kind of particle that so far eludes modern physics. In some theories of dark matter it is composed of bosons, which are a kind of particle like photons and gluons\u2014particles that typically carry the forces of nature. But the dark matter bosons would be different, and would instead simply fill up most of the universe.But because of their nature, the boson dark matter particles could easily pile up on themselves forming dense, compact objects. These objects would not emit any radiation at all and would appear to outside observers to act like black holes.While it's highly unlikely that this observation has revealed the existence of a boson star, the idea is worth considering for two reasons. One, the star is definitely orbiting something small, dense, and compact. This offers a natural test bed for our understanding of gravity as given by Einstein's general theory of relativity. Finding any sort of discrepancy between theoretical expectations and observational results would be a landmark discovery.Second, we can use this as a case study in the nature of boson stars. We can further investigate the properties of these exotic and hypothetical objects, and use this scenario to test those ideas. While it's unlikely that those tests will come out in favor of the existence of boson stars, the more we learn about dark matter, even if it's just a slow process of ruling out interesting ideas, the better.

  "answer_squad": " Artemis Program",
  "text": "Through the Artemis Program, NASA plans to send the first astronauts to the moon in over 50 years. Before the decade is over, this program aims to establish the infrastructure that will allow for a \"sustained program of lunar exploration and development.\" The European Space Agency (ESA) also has big plans, which include the creation of a moon Village that will serve as a spiritual successor to the International Space Station (ISS). China and Roscosmos also came together in June 2021 to announce that they would build the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) around the lunar south pole.          In all cases, space agencies plan to harvest local resources to meet their construction and long-term needs\u2014a process known as in-situ resource utilization (ISRU). Based on samples returned by the fifth mission of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program (Chang'e-5), a team of researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) identified indigenous glass fibers for the first time. According to a paper they authored, these fibers were formed by past impacts in the region and could be an ideal building material for future lunar bases.The work was led by Rui Zhao, Laiquan Shen, Dongdong Xiao, and Chao Chang from the CAS Institute of Physics (IOP) in Beijing. They were joined by researchers from the Center of Materials Science and Optoelectronics Engineering at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), the Songshan Lake Materials Laboratory, the Qian Xuesen Laboratory of Space Technology, the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST), and the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Nanjing University. The team's paper, \"Diverse glasses revealed from Chang'E-5 lunar regolith,\" recently appeared in the National Science Review.As the IOP team indicated in their paper, lunar glasses are an important component of lunar soils and are produced by various processes. Altogether, they identified five types based on the formation process involved: volcanic, impact, adhered, deposited, and irradiated. These glasses can remain stable for billions of years, providing a geological record of the moon and leading to a better understanding of its formation and evolution. This includes questions relating to the duration of volcanism, the Late Heavy Bombardment, the origins of lunar water, and the presence of a lunar magnetic field.The team determined that impacts are the most active processes on the lunar surface, as they are \"highly heterogeneous in both temporal and spatial scale\"\u2014i.e., impacts are an ongoing phenomenon, unlike volcanism and other geological activity that ended billions of years ago. By studying the diverse glasses in the 1.73 kg (3.8 lbs) of lunar regolith returned by Chang'E-5 (CE-5) from the northern mare region Oceanus Procellarum, they were able to clarify their origins and attribute to three main mechanisms: impact, deposition, and irradiation.      As they state, the samples were quite different from those returned by the Apollo astronauts and the Soviet Luna program, suggesting that different mechanisms were at work in Oceanus Procellarum: \"Compared with previous Apollo and Luna returned samples that are limited in narrow volcanism ages of 3.9\u20133.0 Ga and cover only about 4.4% of the lunar nearside surface, the CE-5 samples are collected from the youngest lunar region dated to 2.0 Ga and higher mid-high latitude, allowing the moon to be studied in an extended spatiotemporal range. Preliminary characterizations show that the CE-5 samples are mature samples, but have a significantly lower glass content of 8.3%\u201320.0% than that of Apollo samples (25.4%\u201372.3%), implying quite different space environment from Apollo sites.\"                Schematic of the origins of diverse lunar glasses and the corresponding lunar activities. Credit: Laiquan Shen, R.Z. et al. (2023)             Upon characterizing the samples' morphological, microstructural, and geochemical properties, the team found that the CE-5 samples contained various glassy materials. As shown in the image above, this included glass particles of various shapes, such as globules, ellipsoids, dumbbells, and teardrops (a to i). They also noted the presence of elongated glass fibers that (based on their elongation) ranged in shape from tadpoles (n), maces (o), and filaments (p). They further concluded that these fibers were formed by molten materials created by impacts that cooled upon contact with the lunar environment.These fibers would make for a highly effective construction material, consistent with proposals for building lunar bases through ISRU. The IOP team indicated this by addressing previous attempts to fabricate artificial glass fibers from lunar regolith simulants in the lab.In short, their analysis demonstrated that these fibers could be harvested on the moon and used to fabricate the necessary materials: \"[Attempts were made using] lunar simulant materials to fabricate artificial glass fibers in laboratories for future lunar base construction. Our findings directly demonstrate that glass fibers can be produced in-situ on the moon, which could inspire space fabrication of glass fibers such as homogeneous optical fibers and strengthening structural fibers required by future lunar bases.\"Before space agencies can construct long-term habitats on the moon, research that characterizes the lunar environment and its resources is absolutely essential. In addition to providing new insight into the many processes that have shaped the lunar surface over time, the IOP study could provide a pathway toward the creation of permanent bases on the moon. This research could also inform future missions to Mars, which NASA and China plan to commence by 2033. These missions include the creation of surface habitats, and further characterization of the Martian environment could lead to specialized construction methods.

  "question_squad": " What is the largest telescope in the world designed to operate exclusively in the submillimeter-wavelength?",
  "answer_squad": " EAO",
  "text": "Located near the summit of Maunakea, Hawaii, the 15-meter (~49 ft) James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) at the East Asia Observatory (EAO) is the largest telescope in the world designed to operate exclusively in the submillimeter-wavelength. In 2018, Molokai'i High School alumna Mallory Go was awarded time with the JCMT under the Maunakea Scholars program. With the assistance of EAO astronomer Dr. Harriet Parsons, Go obtained unique images of the Horsehead Nebula in polarized light, which revealed the nebula's magnetic fields.          Go (now a graduate student at Brown University) presented the images as part of a Science Fair representing Molokai'i High School. A year later, these observations were used by a team of astronomers from the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI), the University of Science and Technology (UST), and University College London (UCL) to perform a quantitative analysis of the strength and role of magnetic fields in the region. The paper that describes the observations and analysis, \"Magnetic Fields in the Horsehead Nebula,\" recently appeared in The Astronomical Journal.The observations taken in 2018 were taken using the JCMT's POL-2 instrument, a linear polarimeter that obtains polarization data with the help of the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array 2 (SCUBA-2) instrument. Together, these instruments measure how magnetic fields in space influence the alignment of interstellar dust.As Dr. Parsons explained in an EAO press release, \"You can think of POL-2 as a pair of polarized sunglasses sitting in front of the telescope. In Hawaii, many of us are used to wearing polarized sunglasses\u2014they help us to see better by cutting down glare\u2014but at the telescope, by rotating the polarized lenses, we analyze the brightness of the light being observed and deduce if it is under the effect of magnetic fields. Astronomers can look at clouds of gas and dust using such instruments\u2014regions both within our own galaxy or beyond\u2014and expand their understanding of what shapes them.\"The astronomers from KASI, UST, and UCL obtained additional data using the JCMT's other operational instruments\u2014the Heterodyne Array Receiver Program (HARP) and Auto Correlation Spectral Imaging System (ACSIS)\u2014to measure showed how bright and dense the region. The HARP instrument revealed additional spectral line data that showed the presence of a type of carbon monoxide containing oxygen-18 (C18O), a stable isotope of oxygen thought to originate in molecular clouds.Said UCL astronomer Dr. Kate Pattle, one of the study's co-authors, \"The data are impressive and what they tell us is even more impressive. I am delighted that Mallory has given us the chance to work on such a beautiful and iconic region of the sky\u2014and what we've found helps us to understand why the Horsehead Nebula has the shape that it does. These observations tell us a story of two dense regions hidden in the Horsehead. We see a ridge of warm gas and dust\u2014the head and mane of the horse\u2014that is interacting with the ultraviolet photons from nearby bright young stars.\"                This first light image from the Callisto telescope at the SPECULOOS Southern Observatory (SSO) shows the famous Horsehead Nebula. Credit: SPECULOOS Team/E. Jehin/ESO             The JCMT's instruments allowed the team to observe the interaction between the nebula's \"head\" and \"mane\" and nearby young stars\u2014which appears to have had a noticeable effect on the nebula's magnetic field. The team theorized that it folded back on itself along the observatory's line of sight as the Horsehead Nebula formed. Behind this ridge, they observed a cold clump of dense material that appeared to have been sheltered from these interactions\u2014which they suspect will go on to form a new star system.This made the observations especially exciting, as they have allowed astronomers to see what magnetic field lines in regions like the Horsehead Nebula are doing for the first time. As Pattle added, \"This gives us important insight into how stars can continue to form even in regions like the Horsehead, where the cold gas that provides the material for new stars is being eroded by photons from nearby young and hot stars. We expect that our own sun formed as part of a cluster of stars, and so looking at how stars form in the Horsehead Nebula may give us an insight into our own solar system's past.\"Though it is an iconic astronomical object, Go's observations were the first time anyone had attempted to visualize its magnetic field. \"When I heard about the Maunakea Scholars program, I was excited,\" said Go. \"It seemed to me to be such a fantastic opportunity to use the Telescopes on Maunakea. I chose to study the Horsehead Nebula because I thought it was beautiful, and I didn't find much research on it.\" More information:Jihye Hwang et al, Magnetic Fields in the Horsehead Nebula, The Astronomical Journal (2023).

  "text": "A vast galaxy cluster lurks in the center of this image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. Like a submerged sea monster causing waves on the surface, this cosmic leviathan can be identified by the distortions in spacetime around it. The cluster's enormous mass curves spacetime, creating a gravitational lens that bends the light from distant galaxies beyond the cluster. The contorted streaks and arcs of light we see in this image are the result. A host of other galaxies surrounds the cluster, and a handful of foreground stars with tell-tale diffraction spikes are scattered throughout the image.       This particular galaxy cluster, called eMACS J1823.1+7822, lies almost nine billion light-years away in the constellation Draco. It is one of five exceptionally massive galaxy clusters Hubble explored with the aim of measuring the strengths of these gravitational lenses, which would provide insights into the distribution of dark matter in galaxy clusters. Strong gravitational lenses like eMACS J1823.1+7822 can help astronomers study distant galaxies by acting as vast natural telescopes which magnify objects that would otherwise be too faint or distant to resolve.This multiwavelength image layers data from eight different filters and two different instruments: Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys and Wide Field Camera 3. Both instruments can view astronomical objects in just a small slice of the electromagnetic spectrum using filters, which allow astronomers to image objects at precisely selected wavelengths. The combination of observations at different wavelengths lets astronomers develop a more complete picture of the structure, composition, and behavior of an object than visible light alone would reveal.

  "answer_squad": " OpenCellID",
  "text": "Are we alone in the universe? It's a question that fascinates scientists and the public alike. In science, the focus tends to be on our search for life elsewhere. The idea that we might be watched by a distant alien civilization, however, is usually confined to the realm of science fiction.          But if there are other technological civilizations out there, they would probably be significantly more developed than we are. After all, we have only just emerged as a fledgling technical (industrial) civilization in the last 200 years\u2014other technical civilizations could easily be 1,000 or 10,000 or even 100,000 years more advanced than we are.And no one can deny that the pace of our own technological progress is accelerating, in some areas at a blistering pace. To paraphrase science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke's third law\u2014an advanced civilization would appear to us as capable of magic in terms of their technical prowess.Over the last few years, my colleagues and I have started to think about whether an advanced civilization could detect the technological signatures (\"techno-signatures\"), such as radio emissions, from Earth. And if so, what might they detect?Our latest study provides a clue.This isn't the first time such research has been undertaken. But it's now more than 50 years since the topic was properly considered. While a lot has changed since the mid-1970s, by far the biggest change has occurred in the last two decades with the advent of mobile phones. These devices and the towers that connect them have created a new broadband radio emission techno-signature.Although 4G mobile handsets and transmitting towers are relatively low power individually (0.1-200 watt), there are just so many of them\u2014billions of phones and many millions of towers. And the accumulated radio emission from these is beginning to become quite significant. But would it be noticeable to an alien civilization watching from afar? We wanted to find out.It turns out to be rather difficult to find a public database that lists the location and transmitting characteristics of all the mobile towers around the world. But by using the OpenCellID database, with data populated by crowdsourcing, we were able to build a simple model estimating the global distribution of mobile towers.Our model is no doubt crude and incomplete, but it is our best estimate of the techno-signature mobile towers leak out into space.Because the Earth rotates on its axis, an advanced civilization located somewhere in our galaxy would measure the radio emission from mobile towers to rise and fall in intensity as different parts of the Earth rotate into view.The model is complicated by the fact that the transmission of mobile towers is typically beamed towards the horizon. This means that at any given time, towers that are viewed to be setting or rising on the Earth's horizon will contribute most to the measured signal.      Alien conclusions?An advanced civilization making many precise measurements of this radio leakage over time could probably conclude that our planet is mostly covered by water and is separated into several major land masses. The radio leakage typically come from the land masses rather than the water.They might also be able to tell that while most of the mobile radio leakage is associated with land masses, the towers (and presumably their intelligent users) tend to be situated along the coastline.They would also see that mobile tower networks are quite equitably distributed across the planet. That's different to the traditional radio leakage previously recognized as major techno-signatures\u2014in particular, radar and TV transmitters.Our simulations show that significant contributions to the Earth's mobile leakage radiation is being made by developing regions, such as Africa and Asia. This is no surprise given the importance of mobile systems in all aspects of society in developing countries.We calculated the power emitted from Earth\u2014which is about 4 gigawatt (GW) in total at its peak (one GW could power around 750,000 homes for an hour). We estimated the transmission as viewed from three different stars in our galaxy\u2014HD 95735, Barnard's star, and Alpha Centauri A.We worked out that an alien civilization near these locations would, however, need much better telescopes than we have to detect the Earth's mobile radio leakage. But that would be quite probable, given most technical civilizations are expected to be much more advanced than we are.There are also other types of emissions they could see, such as military radar systems and deep space communication transmissions to distant spacecraft, such as the Voyager space probes. While these signals would be relatively rare events for an observing alien, they have the advantage of being extremely powerful.Radio techno-signatures are probably the defining characteristic of our own civilization's existence, at least from an alien's perspective. But an extraterrestrial species would also find leakage radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum (including visible light).If we continue to increase our energy consumption at the current rate, \"waste-heat\"\u2014an unavoidable end-product of energy usage\u2014will also be discharged into space. There it would manifest itself as an anomalous excess at infra-red wavelengths\u2014a telltale sign of an active technical civilization.Other techno-signatures including industrial pollutants in the Earth's atmosphere would also be noticeable to aliens equipped with powerful telescopes and spectral analysis systems (which break down light according to wavelength). An advanced alien civilization could no doubt have a good guess at our particular phase of industrialization and our energy consumption.On Earth, we use the Kardashev scale for estimating the development of alien civilizations based on their energy usage\u2014on that scale we'd appear as an emerging technical civilization, not yet on the bottom rung of the ladder.And even if an alien species failed to detect all this at the moment, they might do better very soon. We plan to extend this work to include traditional radio techno-signatures and other emerging sources of radio leakage radiation, including 5G systems, wifi, digital transmissions and deep space communications.This would also include the cocoon of radio emission that will soon surround the Earth as the growth of huge satellite constellations such as Starlink and OneWeb provide global wifi coverage.Who knows? It might even be possible for aliens to decode the complex modulation of our mobile communication systems. Ultimately, as the Earth becomes artificially brighter at all wavelengths, the chances that they detect us before we detect them, cannot be ruled out.

  "text": "Astronomers have described the first radiation belt observed outside our solar system, using a coordinated array of 39 radio dishes from Hawaii to Germany to obtain high-resolution images. The images of persistent, intense radio emissions from an ultracool dwarf reveal the presence of a cloud of high-energy electrons trapped in the object's powerful magnetic field, forming a double-lobed structure analogous to radio images of Jupiter's radiation belts.          \"We are actually imaging the magnetosphere of our target by observing the radio-emitting plasma\u2014its radiation belt\u2014in the magnetosphere. That has never been done before for something the size of a gas giant planet outside of our solar system,\" said Melodie Kao, a postdoctoral fellow at UC Santa Cruz and first author of a paper on the new findings published May 15 in Nature.Strong magnetic fields form a \"magnetic bubble\" around a planet called a magnetosphere, which can trap and accelerate particles to near the speed of light. All the planets in our solar system that have such magnetic fields, including Earth, as well as Jupiter and the other giant planets, have radiation belts consisting of these high-energy charged particles trapped by the planet's magnetic field.Earth's radiation belts, known as the Van Allen belts, are large donut-shaped zones of high-energy particles captured from solar winds by the magnetic field. Most of the particles in Jupiter's belts are from volcanoes on its moon Io. If you could put them side by side, the radiation belt that Kao and her team have imaged would be 10 million times brighter than Jupiter's.Particles deflected by the magnetic field toward the poles generate auroras (\"northern lights\") when they interact with the atmosphere, and Kao's team also obtained the first image capable of differentiating between the location of an object's aurora and its radiation belts outside our solar system.                The first images of an extrasolar radiation belt were obtained by combining 39 radio telescopes to form a virtual telescope spanning the globe from Hawaii to Germany. Credit: Melodie Kao, Amy Mioduszewski             The ultracool dwarf imaged in this study straddles the boundary between low-mass stars and massive brown dwarfs. \"While the formation of stars and planets can be different, the physics inside of them can be very similar in that mushy part of the mass continuum connecting low-mass stars to brown dwarfs and gas giant planets,\" Kao explained.      Characterizing the strength and shape of the magnetic fields of this class of objects is largely uncharted terrain, she said. Using their theoretical understanding of these systems and numerical models, planetary scientists can predict the strength and shape of a planet's magnetic field, but they haven't had a good way to easily test those predictions.\"Auroras can be used to measure the strength of the magnetic field, but not the shape. We designed this experiment to showcase a method for assessing the shapes of magnetic fields on brown dwarfs and eventually exoplanets,\" Kao said.The strength and shape of the magnetic field can be an important factor in determining a planet's habitability. \"When we're thinking about the habitability of exoplanets, the role of their magnetic fields in maintaining a stable environment is something to consider in addition to things like the atmosphere and climate,\" Kao said.To generate a magnetic field, a planet's interior must be hot enough to have electrically conducting fluids, which in the case of Earth is the molten iron in its core. In Jupiter, the conducting fluid is hydrogen under so much pressure it becomes metallic. Metallic hydrogen probably also generates magnetic fields in brown dwarfs, Kao said, while in the interiors of stars the conducting fluid is ionized hydrogen.                The electron radiation belt and aurora of an ultracool dwarf were imaged by combining 39 radio telescopes to form a virtual telescope spanning the globe from Hawaii to Germany. Credit: Melodie Kao, Amy Mioduszewski             The ultracool dwarf known as LSR J1835+3259 was the only object Kao felt confident would yield the high-quality data needed to resolve its radiation belts.\"Now that we've established that this particular kind of steady-state, low-level radio emission traces radiation belts in the large-scale magnetic fields of these objects, when we see that kind of emission from brown dwarfs\u2014and eventually from gas giant exoplanets\u2014we can more confidently say they probably have a big magnetic field, even if our telescope isn't big enough to see the shape of it,\" Kao said, adding that she is looking forward to when the Next Generation Very Large Array, currently being planned by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), can image many more extrasolar radiation belts.\"This is a critical first step in finding many more such objects and honing our skills to search for smaller and smaller magnetospheres, eventually enabling us to study those of potentially habitable, Earth-size planets,\" said co-author Evgenya Shkolnik at Arizona State University, who has been studying the magnetic fields and habitability of planets for many years.The team used the High Sensitivity Array, consisting of 39 radio dishes coordinated by the NRAO in the United States and the Effelsberg radio telescope operated by the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Germany.\"By combining radio dishes from across the world, we can make incredibly high-resolution images to see things no one has ever seen before. Our image is comparable to reading the top row of an eye chart in California while standing in Washington, D.C.,\" said co-author Jackie Villadsen at Bucknell University.Kao emphasized that this discovery was a true team effort, relying heavily on the observational expertise of co-first author Amy Mioduszewski at NRAO in planning the study and analyzing the data, as well as the multiwavelength stellar flare expertise of Villadsen and Shkolnik.

  "text": "After 15 years of attempts, researchers using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have for the first time successfully detected water outgassing from a main-belt comet.          A recently published Nature paper \"Direct detection of water from a main-belt comet with JWST\" led by Michael Kelley of the University of Maryland reports the first direct spectroscopic detection of water outgassing from a main-belt comet named Comet Read. Planetary Science Institute Senior Scientist Henry Hsieh is a co-author on the paper.Main-belt comets are a rare sub-class of comets that have mostly circular orbits entirely confined to the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, but show comet-like behavior\u2014ejecting material that creates a fuzzy appearance and often tails\u2014that astronomers believe is produced by sublimation\u2014or the transition of ice directly to gas\u2014of icy material.Only dust has ever been detected being ejected by main-belt comets though, despite many attempts to detect escaping gases that should also accompany sublimation-powered cometary activity. Most main-belt asteroids are not expected to have much ice, given their location in the warm inner solar system where they are thought to have resided for billions of years.                Diagram showing the orbit of Comet Read along with the main asteroid belt (shown as a white fuzzy ring at the center of the image) and the orbits of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, and Comet Halley for comparison, showing how \u201ctraditional\u201d comets like Comet Halley spend much more time far from the Sun in the cold outer Solar System than main-belt comets like Comet Read, whose orbits keep them much closer to the Sun and therefore in a much warmer environment all the time. Credit: Henry Hsieh (Planetary Science Institute).             For comparison, most other comets that display activity caused by sublimation spend large portions of their time in the cold outer solar system on highly elongated orbits that only occasionally pass through the inner solar system. Given these considerations, doubts have persisted about whether main-belt comets could really be icy. Until now.\"Since the discovery of main-belt comets, we have collected a substantial body of evidence that their activity is produced by sublimation, but until now, it has all been indirect. This new result from JWST represents the first direct evidence of sublimation in the form of water outgassing\u2014or outgassing of any kind\u2014from a main-belt comet, following studies dating back to 2008 to detect outgassing in main-belt comets using some of the biggest ground-based telescopes in the world,\" explained Hsieh, who led the discovery of main-belt comets as a new kind of comet in 2006.      In the paper, Hsieh and his colleagues further find that Comet Read, and therefore possibly other main-belt comets as well, has a fundamentally different chemical composition from other comets, showing almost no carbon dioxide, a common component of cometary outgassing, relative to the amount of water found. Whether it experienced different formation circumstances or evolutionary history,Comet Read is unlikely to be a recent asteroid belt interloper from the outer solar system. Based on these results, main-belt comets appear to represent a sample of volatile material that is currently unrepresented in observations of classical comets and the meteoritic record, making them important for understanding the early solar system's volatile inventory and its subsequent evolution.                This image of Comet 238P/Read was captured by the NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) instrument on NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope on September 8, 2022. It displays the hazy halo, called the coma, and tail that are characteristic of comets, as opposed to asteroids. The dusty coma and tail result from the vaporization of ices as the Sun warms the main body of the comet. Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, M. Kelley (University of Maryland). Image processing: H. Hsieh (Planetary Science Institute), A. Pagan (STScI)             \"Because substantial water ice\u2014which is a major component of the volatile material that typically produces activity in 'classical' comets from the outer solar system\u2014is unexpected in main-belt asteroids given how close to the sun they are, there has always been some doubt about whether main-belt comet activity is produced by water ice sublimation rather than some other process that doesn't involve ice, such as impacts or material being flung into space by fast-spinning asteroids,\" Hsieh said.\"Water in main-belt comets is important because objects from the main asteroid belt have been proposed as a potential source of Earth's water in the early solar system, where the modern day main-belt comets appear to provide an opportunity to test this hypothesis. This only works though if they do in fact contain water ice. The confirmation of water outgassing in at least one main-belt comet confirms that learning about the origin of Earth's water from main-belt comets is a viable possibility,\" Hsieh said.The team used JWST to observe Read shortly after its close approach to the sun, when outgassing was expected to be at its strongest, taking both imaging and spectroscopic observations at near-infrared wavelengths in order to search for characteristic spectroscopic features of water vapor and other common gases produced by cometary sublimation.

  "answer_squad": " seek out surface ice in the permanently shadowed craters of the moon's South Pole",
  "text": "While the CubeSat couldn't reach the lunar South Pole to help seek ice, it fulfilled several technology goals that will empower future missions for the benefit of humanity.          NASA's Lunar Flashlight launched on Dec. 11, 2022, to demonstrate several new technologies, with an ultimate goal to seek out surface ice in the permanently shadowed craters of the moon's South Pole. Since then, the briefcase-size satellite's miniaturized propulsion system\u2014the first of its kind ever flown\u2014proved unable to generate enough thrust to get into lunar orbit, despite months of effort by the operations team. Because the CubeSat cannot complete maneuvers to stay in the Earth-moon system, NASA has called an end to the mission.NASA relies on technology demonstrations to fill specific knowledge gaps and to test new technologies. Used for the first time beyond Earth's orbit, Lunar Flashlight's propulsion system and green fuel were such demonstrations. Although the propulsion system was unable to produce the desired thrust\u2014likely because of debris buildup in the thruster fuel lines\u2014newly developed propulsion system components exceeded performance expectations.Also surpassing expectations were Lunar Flashlight's never-before-flown Sphinx flight computer\u2014a low-power computer developed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California to withstand the radiation of deep space\u2014and the spacecraft's upgraded Iris radio. Featuring a new precision navigation capability, the radio can be used by future small spacecraft to rendezvous and land on solar system bodies.\"Technology demonstrations are, by their nature, higher risk and high reward, and they're essential for NASA to test and learn,\" said Christopher Baker, program executive for Small Spacecraft Technology in the Space Technology Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Lunar Flashlight was highly successful from the standpoint of being a testbed for new systems that had never flown in space before. Those systems, and the lessons Lunar Flashlight taught us, will be used for future missions.\"The mission's miniaturized four-laser reflectometer, a science instrument that had never flown before, either, also tested successfully, giving the mission's science team confidence that the laser would have been able to detect ice if it were present at the lunar surface.\"It's disappointing for the science team, and for the whole Lunar Flashlight team, that we won't be able to use our laser reflectometer to make measurements at the moon,\" said Barbara Cohen, the mission's principal investigator at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"But like all the other systems, we collected a lot of in-flight performance data on the instrument that will be incredibly valuable to future iterations of this technique.\"      Propulsion system performance challengesDespite the mission's technological wins, Lunar Flashlight's miniaturized propulsion system struggled to provide sufficient thrust to put the CubeSat on course for the planned near-rectilinear halo orbit that would have given the spacecraft weekly flybys of the moon's South Pole.The team suspects that debris obstructed the fuel lines, causing the diminished and inconsistent thrust. The miniaturized propulsion system included an additively manufactured fuel feed system that likely developed the debris\u2014such as metal powder or shavings\u2014and obstructed fuel flow to the thrusters, limiting their performance. Although the team devised a creative method for using just one thruster to maneuver the spacecraft, Lunar Flashlight needed more consistent thrust to reach its planned orbit.The operations team calculated a new orbit that could be reached using the spacecraft's small amount of potential remaining thrust. The plan called for putting the CubeSat on a path that would place it in orbit around Earth rather than the moon, with monthly flybys of the lunar South Pole. While this would have meant fewer flybys, the spacecraft would have flown closer to the surface.With the mission running out of time to arrive at the needed orbit, the operations team tried to dislodge any debris from the fuel lines by increasing the fuel pressure well beyond the propulsion system's designed capacity. Despite limited success, the required trajectory correction maneuvers couldn't be completed in time.\"The student operations team at Georgia Tech, with assistance from JPL and NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, rose to the challenge and came up with an incredible array of inventive techniques to utilize what tiny amount of thrust Lunar Flashlight's propulsion system could deliver,\" said John Baker, Lunar Flashlight project manager at JPL. \"We learned a lot and honed new methods and strategies for working with tiny spacecraft.\"After having traveled out past the moon, Lunar Flashlight is now moving back toward Earth and will fly past our planet with a close approach of about 40,000 miles (65,000 kilometers) on May 17. The CubeSat will then continue into deep space and orbit the sun. It continues to communicate with mission operators, and NASA is weighing options for the future of the spacecraft.

Particles emanated along the jets, a signature of magnetic reconnection involving field lines open to interplanetary space,\" said SwRI's Dr. Radoslav Bucik, the lead author of a new study published this month in Astronomy & Astrophysics Letters. \"The Solar Orbiter frequently detects this type of activity, but this period showed very unusual elemental compositions.\"In one ion injection, the intensity of the rare isotope Helium-3 exceeded the amount of hydrogen, the most abundant element on the sun, and the levels of iron were similar to the isotope Helium-4, the second most abundant element on the sun. In another injection two days later, the amount of Helium-3 had significantly decreased to an almost negligible amount.\"Our analysis shows that the elemental and spectral variations in recurrent injections are associated with the shape of the jet, the size of the jet source and the distribution of the underlying photospheric field that evolved over time,\" Bucik said. \"We believe that understanding the variability in recurrent events from a single source sheds light on the acceleration mechanism in solar flares.\"The observations made by Solar Orbiter are unique as the propagation effects that can affect abundances could be minimal near the sun. The distance of just 0.5 AU has given the scientific team a remarkably detailed view of solar events.\"When we are closer, we have a considerably better spatial resolution,\" Bucik said. \"We are able to gain more insight into the source of these energetic particles because we can see the internal structure associated with acceleration processes as the injection evolves. Observations from twice that distance, 1 AU, are not very clear in comparison.\"Bucik and his colleagues hope to learn even more from the Solar Orbiter's closest approaches to the sun at 0.3 AU.\"These observations could help predict future solar energetic particle events,\" Bucik said. \"These particles can damage satellites and equipment and potentially harm astronauts.

  "text": "Using NASA's Swift observatory and ESA's XMM-Newton satellite, Indian astronomers have inspected a prominent high synchrotron peaked blazar known as 1ES 1959+650. Results of the study, published May 5 on the arXiv pre-print server, shed more light on the nature of this source.          Blazars are very compact quasars associated with supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of active, giant elliptical galaxies. They belong to a larger group of active galaxies that host active galactic nuclei (AGN), and are the most numerous extragalactic gamma-ray sources. Their characteristic features are relativistic jets pointed almost exactly toward the Earth.Based on their optical emission properties, astronomers divide blazars into two classes: flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) that feature prominent and broad optical emission lines, and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), which do not. Some blazars are high synchrotron peaked (HSP) sources as their synchrotron peak is above 1,000 THz in the rest frame. Observations show that particles are efficiently accelerated up to very high energies (VHEs) in the jets of HSPs, which makes such sources very interesting for astronomers studying extreme blazars.At a redshift of approximately 0.048, 1ES 1959+650 is a prominent nearby HSP blazar in which the synchrotron peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED) appears in the ultraviolet/X-ray band. It exhibits strong flux variability in optical, X-ray and TeV energy bands and has experienced an unprecedented X-ray flaring activity between August 2015 and January 2016.Recently, a team of astronomers led by Kiran A. Wani of the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) in India, has analyzed Swift and XMM-Newton observations of 1ES 1959+650, with the main aim of investigating the temporal and spectral variability of this blazar on timescales from minutes to years covering different flux states.\"Swift-XRT and XMM\u2013Newton EPIC-pn observations have been used to study the HSP 1ES 1959+650 during the period June 2018\u2013December 2020 in total 127 nights of observations,\" the researchers wrote in the paper.The study detected significant variability of 1ES 1959+650 in seven of the observing nights with flux variability amplitude varying between 1.95% and 3.12%. The flux doubling timescale was found to be some 15,270 seconds and the black hole mass was calculated to be about 295 million solar masses.The observations show that 1ES 1959+650 exhibits log-normality behavior on long-term timescales. The astronomers assume that such behavior could be attributed to minijets-in-a-jet model or could be due to the propagation of relativistic shocks down the blazar's jet.The research also found that on the long timescales, 1ES 1959+650 showed high as well as low flux states. Moreover, the hardness ratio analysis on long term timescales indicates that the blazar follows the so-called \"harder-when-brighter\" trend.The astronomers also managed to estimate the magnetic field strength of the emitting region in 1ES 1959+650\u2014which was found to be approximately 0.64 Gauss. This is consistent with previous results. More information:Kiran A Wani et al, X-ray Studies of Blazar 1ES 1959+650 Using SWIFT & XMM-NEWTON Satellite, arXiv (2023).

  "text": "How did we get here? Where are we going? And how long will it take? These questions are as old as humanity itself, and, if they've already been asked by other species elsewhere in the universe, potentially very much older than that.          They are also some of the fundamental questions we are trying to answer in the study of the universe, called cosmology. One cosmological conundrum is how fast the universe is expanding, which is measured by a number called the Hubble constant. And there is quite a bit of tension around it.In two new papers led by my colleague Patrick Kelly at the University of Minnesota, we have successfully used a new technique\u2014involving light from an exploding star that arrived at Earth via multiple winding routes through the expanding universe\u2014to measure the Hubble constant. The papers are published in Science and  The Astrophysical Journal.And if our results don't quite resolve the tension, they do give us another clue\u2014and more questions to ask.Standard candles and the expanding universeWe have known since the 1920s that the universe is expanding.Around 1908, US astronomer Henrietta Leavitt found a way to measure the intrinsic brightness of a kind of star called a Cepheid variable\u2014not how bright they appear from Earth, which depends on distance and other factors, but how bright they really are. Cepheids grow brighter and dimmer in a regular cycle, and Leavitt showed the intrinsic brightness was related to the length of this cycle.Leavitt's Law, as it is now called, lets scientists use Cepheids as \"standard candles\": objects whose intrinsic brightness is known, and therefore, whose distance can be calculated.How does this work? Imagine it is night, and you are standing on a long, dark street with only a few light poles going down the road. Now imagine every light pole has the same type of light bulb, with the same power. You'll notice the distant ones appear fainter than the nearby ones.We know that light fades proportionately to its distance, in something called the inverse-square law for light. Now, if you can measure how bright each light appears to you, and if you already know how bright it should be, you can then figure out how far away each light pole is.In 1929, another US astronomer, Edwin Hubble, was able to find a number of these Cepheid stars in other galaxies and measure their distance\u2014and from those distances and other measurements, he could determine that the universe was expanding.      Different methods give different resultsThis standard candle method is a powerful one, allowing us to measure the vast universe. We are always looking for different candles that can be better measured, and seen at much greater distances.                Multiple views of a single supernova\u2014spread across time and space\u2014allowed scientists to measure how fast the universe is expanding. Credit: P.L. Kelly et al., Science 10.1126/science.abh1322 (2023), Author provided             Some recent efforts to measure the universe further from Earth, like the SH0ES project I was a part of, led by Nobel laureate Adam Riess, have used Cepheids alongside a type of exploding star called a Type Ia supernova, which can also be used as a standard candle.There are also other methods to measure Hubble's constant, such as one that uses the cosmic microwave background\u2014relic light or radiation that began to travel through the universe shortly after the Big Bang.The problem is that these two measurements, one nearby using supernovae and Cepheids, and one much farther away using the microwave background, differ by nearly 10%. Astronomers call this difference the Hubble tension, and have been looking for new measurement techniques to resolve it.A new method: gravitational lensingIn our new work, we have successfully used a new technique to measure this expansion rate of the universe. The work is based on a supernova called Supernova Refsdal.In 2014, our team spotted multiple images of the same supernova\u2014the first time such a \"lensed\" supernova had been observed. Instead of the Hubble Space Telescope seeing one supernova, we saw five!How does this happen? The light from the supernova went out in all directions, but it traveled through space warped by the enormous gravitational fields of a huge cluster of galaxies, which bent some of the light's path in such a way that it ended up coming to Earth via multiple routes. Each appearance of the supernova had reached us along a different path through the universe.Imagine three trains leaving the same station at the same time. However, one goes directly to the next station, the other makes a wide trip through the mountains, and another via the coast. They all leave and arrive at the same stations, but take different trips and so while they leave at the same time, they will arrive at different times.So our lensed images show the same supernova, that exploded at one certain point in time, but each image has traveled a different path. By looking at the arrival at Earth of each appearance of the supernova\u2014one of which happened in 2015, after the exploding star had been spotted already\u2014we were able to measure their travel time, and therefore how much the universe had grown while the image was in transit.Are we there yet?This gave us a different, but unique measurement of the growth of the universe. In the papers, we find this measurement is closer to the cosmic microwave background measurement, rather than the nearby Cepheid and supernova measurement. However, based on its location, it should be closer to the Cepheid and supernova measurement.While this does not settle the debate at all, it gives us another clue to look at. There could be a problem with the supernova value, or our understanding of galaxy clusters and the models to apply to lensing, or something else entirely.Like the kids in the back of the car on a road trip asking \"are we there yet\", we still don't know.

  "text": "Fast radio bursts\u2014intense, milliseconds-long flashes of radio energy from outer space\u2014have puzzled astronomers since they were first spotted in 2007. A single burst can emit as much energy in its brief life as the Sun does in a few days.          The great majority of the short-lived pulses originate outside our Milky Way galaxy. We don't know what produces most of them, or how.In new research published in Science, we observed a repeating fast radio burst for more than a year and discovered signs it is surrounded by a strong but highly changeable magnetic field.Our results suggest the source of this cosmic explosion may be a binary system made up of a neutron star whirling through winds of dense, magnetized plasma produced by a massive companion star or even a black hole.A fast radio burst that never stops repeatingThe repeating burst known as FRB 20190520B was discovered in 2022 by astronomers at the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) in China. Repeating fast radio bursts are rare, but FRB 20190520B is the rarest of all: it is the only one that never rests, producing radio bursts a few times an hour, sometimes at multiple radio frequencies.After this intriguing object was first found, astronomers rushed to follow up the initial observation using other radio wavelengths.Further investigation showed FRB 20190520B resides in an extremely dense environment in a dwarf galaxy 3.9 billion light years away. There are also materials surrounding the FRB source that produce strong, persistent radio emissions.This led to suggestions that the bursting source is a young neutron star in a complex environment.Powerful magnetic fieldsWhat else can we learn about this intergalactic firecracker and its environment? We carried out observations of FRB 20190520B using CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope, Murriyang, in New South Wales and the Green Bank Telescope in the United States.To our surprise, FRB 20190520B turned out to produce strong signals at relatively high radio frequencies. These high-frequency signals turned out to be highly polarized\u2014which means the electromagnetic waves are \"waving\" much more strongly in one direction than in others.                Changes in the magnetic field around a repeating fast radio burst hint at the nature of its origin. Credit: Di Li / ScienceApe / Chinese Academy of Science             We found the direction of this polarization changes at different frequencies. Measuring how much it changes tells us about the strength of the magnetic field the signal has traveled through.As it turns out, this polarization measure suggests the environment around FRB 20190520B is highly magnetized. And what's more, the strength of the magnetic field appeared to vary over the 16 months we observed the source\u2014and even flipped direction entirely twice.This change in direction of the magnetic field around a fast radio burst has never been observed before.      Filling in the pictureWhat does this tell us about FRB 20190520B? Most popular theories to explain recent observations of repeating fast radio bursts involve binary systems made up of a neutron star and either another massive star or a black hole.While we cannot rule out other hypotheses yet, our results favor the massive star scenario.Massive stars are known to have strong stellar winds with organized magnetic fields around them. If the source of the bursts were moving in and out of the stellar wind region as it travels through its orbit, we would expect the observed magnetic field direction to reverse.The time scale of the magnetic field reversal, the measured variability in the apparent field strength, and the dense plasma surrounding the burst source all fit into this picture.What's next?Our observations might provide crucial evidence to support the hypothesis that sources of repeating fast radio bursts have a massive companion capable of producing highly magnetized plasma.More importantly, the binary hypothesis gives us a prediction for the future. If it is correct, the changes in polarization of the radio signals from FRB 20190520B should rise and fall over longer periods of time.So we will be watching. Future observations with Murriyang and the Green Bank Telescope will reveal whether FRB 20190520B is truly in a binary system\u2014or whether the Universe will surprise us once again.

  "text": "A team of space scientists from Finland, Greece and the U.S. has found evidence showing that polarized optical emissions observed during a tidal disruption event were caused by colliding streams of material from a destroyed star. In their study, reported in the journal Science, the group analyzed data from a tidal disruption event in the WISEA galaxy.          Prior research has shown that if a black hole moves close enough to a star, the star can be stretched into long strands rather than falling in directly. Such actions are known as tidal disruption events (TDEs) and the strand material from the destroyed star tends to light up as it circles the black hole before falling in. In this new effort, the researchers sought to learn more about the source of a bright light from such a TDE strand. To that end, they obtained data from the Nordic Optical Telescope as it had captured a TDE in action and used software from the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center to study it.They were able to see that material left over from the TDE circled all the way around the black hole. They were also able to see that the material grew hotter due to energy from the encounter.During their initial work, they found that optical polarization measurements surrounding the TDE varied during the event and peaked with a linear polarization degree of 25 \u00b1 4%. They noted that such a high degree of polarization suggested the presence of a relativistic jet. But eight months later, no radio emissions were detected, which would not have been the case had the emissions been associated with a relativistic jet.The team next compared their observations with models depicting interactions between black holes and stars. They report it was likely that as material left over from the TDE encircled the black hole, it ran into similar material that had gone around the black hole in the opposite direction and produced a shockwave\u2014and that was the source of the high polarization they had observed.

  "text": "Astronomers said on Friday they have identified the \"largest\" cosmic explosion ever observed, a fireball 100 times the size of our Solar System that suddenly began blazing in the distant universe more than three years ago.          While the astronomers offered what they think is the most likely explanation for the explosion, they emphasized that more research was needed to understand the puzzling phenomenon.The explosion, called AT2021lwx, is not the brightest flash ever observed in the universe. That record is still held by a gamma-ray burst in October that was nicknamed BOAT\u2014for Brightest Of All Time.Philip Wiseman, an astrophysicist at Britain's University of Southampton and the lead author of a new study, said that AT2021lwx was considered the \"largest\" explosion because it had released far more energy over the last three years than was produced by BOAT's brief flash.Wiseman told AFP it was an \"accidental discovery\".The Zwicky Transient Facility in California first spotted AT2021lwx during an automated sweep of the sky in 2020.But \"it basically sat in a database\" until being noticed by humans the following year, Wiseman said.It was only when astronomers, including Wiseman, looked at it through more powerful telescopes that they realized what they had on their hands.By analyzing different wavelengths of light, they worked out that the explosion was roughly eight billion light years away.That is much farther away than most other new flashes of light in the sky\u2014which means the explosion behind it must be far greater.It is estimated to be around two trillion times brighter than the Sun, Wiseman said.Astronomers have looked into several possible explanations.One is that AT2021lwx is an exploding star\u2014but the flash is 10 times brighter than any previously seen \"supernova\".Another possibility is what is called a tidal disruption event, when a star is torn apart as it is sucked into a supermassive black hole. But AT2021lwx is still three times brighter than those events, and Wiseman said their research did not point in this direction.The only somewhat comparable bright cosmic event is a quasar, when supermassive black holes swallow huge amounts of gas in the center of galaxies.But they tend to flicker in brightness, Wiseman said, whereas AT2021lwx suddenly started flaring up from nothing three years ago, and it is still blazing away.\"This thing we have never, ever seen before\u2014it just came out of nowhere,\" Wiseman said.'Absolute puzzle'In the new study, published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, the international team of researchers laid out what they believe is the most likely scenario.Their theory is that a massive, single cloud of gas\u2014around 5,000 times larger than the Sun\u2014is slowly being consumed by a supermassive black hole.But Wiseman said that \"in science, there's never certainty\". The team are working on new simulations to see if their theory is \"fully plausible,\" he added.One problem could be that supermassive black holes sit in the center of galaxies\u2014for an explosion this size, the galaxy would be expected to be as vast as the Milky Way, Wiseman said.But no one has been able to spot a galaxy in the vicinity of AT2021lwx.\"That's an absolute puzzle,\" Wiseman admitted.Now that astronomers know what to look for, they are searching the skies to see if other similar explosions have been missed.

  "text": "For the first time, astronomers have captured images that show a star consuming one of its planets. The star, named ZTF SLRN-2020, is located in the Milky Way galaxy, in the constellation Aquila. As the star swallowed its planet, the star brightened to 100 times its normal level, allowing the 26-person team of astronomers I worked with to detect this event as it happened.          I am a theoretical astrophysicist, and I developed the computer models that our team uses to interpret the data we collect from telescopes. Although we only see the effects on the star, not the planet directly, our team is confident that the event we witnessed was a star swallowing its planet. Witnessing such an event for the first time has confirmed the long-standing assumption that stars swallow their planets and has illuminated how this fascinating process plays out.Finding a flash in the dynamic night skyThe team I work with searches for the bursts of light and gas that occur when two stars merge into a bigger, single star. To do this, we have been using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility, a telescope located on Palomar Mountain in Southern California. It takes nightly images of broad swaths of the sky, and astronomers can then compare these images to find stars that change in brightness over time, or what are called astronomical transients.Finding stars that change in brightness isn't the challenge\u2014it's sorting out the cause behind any specific change to a star. As my colleague Kishalay De likes to say, \"There are plenty of things in the sky that go boom.\" The trick to identifying stellar mergers is to combine visible light\u2014like the data collected at Palomar\u2014with infrared data from NASA's WISE space telescope, which has been surveying the entire sky for the past decade.In 2020, the star ZTF SLRN-2020 suddenly became 100 times brighter in visible light over just 10 days. It then slowly started to fade back toward its normal brightness. About nine months before, the same object started to emit a lot of infrared light, too. This is exactly what it looks like when two stars merge together, with one critical difference\u2014everything was scaled down. The brightness and total energy of this event were about a thousand times lower than any of the merging stellar pairs astronomers had found to date. When a star swallows its planets                The star ZTF SLRN-2020 increased in brightness in both visible and infrared wavelengths of light, with the peak occurring on May 24, 2020. Credit: M. MacLeod, CC BY-ND The idea that stars could engulf some of their planets has been a long-standing assumption in astronomy. Astronomers have long known that when stars run out of hydrogen in their cores, they get brighter and begin to increase in size.Many planets have orbits that are smaller than the eventual size of their parent stars. So, when a star runs out of fuel and starts to expand, the planets nearby are inevitably consumed.      Interpreting a stellar flashIn the ZTF SLRN-2020 outburst, our team never saw the planet itself, only the brightening from when the star absorbed the planet. This is where combining theoretical models with the observational data allowed us to understand what the telescopes captured.The merging of two stars into a single, bigger star is a dramatic event that throws matter out into the stars' surroundings. A large part of my career has focused on modeling the way stellar gas moves and crashes into itself and is expelled in these moments of intense interaction.My work has shown that the total mass of matter ejected in a merging event is proportional to the size of the objects involved in the merger. Merge two equally large stars and you see a huge disturbance. Merge one star with a much smaller companion and the event might throw out a tiny fraction of the total mass of the stars.The energy released during ZTF SLRN-2020's outburst was a thousand times lower than typical for a two-star merger. This implies that the object that merged with the star weighed a thousand times less than a normal star. This clue pointed our team toward a gas giant planet\u2014like Jupiter in our own solar system, which weighs roughly a thousand times less than the Sun.The planet around ZTF SLRN-2020 skimmed the stellar surface before eventually falling into the star.Compared to Jupiter, however, this planet must have orbited much closer to the star, with one revolution around the star only taking a few days. About 1% of stars share this configuration of a large planet orbiting incredibly close to its parent star.Further, I think that this configuration of a big planet close to its star is important in generating the event our team saw. My past research suggests that smaller planets\u2014or ones in more-distant orbits that only get consumed once a star has grown massively in size\u2014might be swallowed without a detectable flash.Learning from the real thingFrom our data and modeling for ZTF SLRN-2020, our team has been able to paint a much clearer picture of how stars and planets merge. First, the planet skims across the surface of the star for many years, slowly heating up and expelling material from the star's atmosphere. As this gas expands and cools, some of it forms molecules and dust. This cloud of dust gives the star a progressively redder color and emits increasing amounts of infrared radiation.In the case of ZTF SLRN-2020, the orbit of the planet shrank slowly at first, then faster and faster as the planet smashed through the denser layers of the star's atmosphere. Eventually, in just a few final days, the planet plunged below the surface of the star and was torn apart by the heat and force of the collision. This rapid injection of energy supplied heat to power ZTF SLRN-2020's 10-day, hundredfold increase in brightness. Following this climactic moment, the star began to fade, telling our team that the planet-swallowing process was over and that the star was beginning to go back to business as usual.While the destructive event has passed, there is still much to be learned. Next week our team will start analyzing data from the James Webb Space Telescope in the hopes of learning about the chemistry of the gas that now surrounds ZTF SLRN-2020.

That makes the rings much younger than Saturn itself, which is about 4.5 billion years old.\"In a way, we've gotten closure on a question that started with James Clerk Maxwell,\" said Kempf, associate professor in the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at CU Boulder.The researchers arrived at that closure by studying what might seem like an unusual subject: dust.Kempf explained that tiny grains of rocky material wash through Earth's solar system on an almost constant basis. In some cases, this flux can leave behind a thin layer of dust on planetary bodies, including on the ice that makes up Saturn's rings.In the new study, he and his colleagues set out to put a date on Saturn's rings by studying how rapidly this layer of dust builds up\u2014a bit like telling how old a house is by running your finger along its surfaces.\"Think about the rings like the carpet in your house,\" Kempf said. \"If you have a clean carpet laid out, you just have to wait. Dust will settle on your carpet. The same is true for the rings.\"It was an arduous process: From 2004 to 2017, the team used an instrument called the Cosmic Dust Analyzer aboard NASA's late Cassini spacecraft to analyze specks of dust flying around Saturn. Over those 13 years, the researchers collected just 163 grains that had originated from beyond the planet's close neighborhood. But it was enough. Based on their calculations, Saturn's rings have likely been gathering dust for only a few hundred million years.The planet's rings, in other words, are new phenomena, arising (and potentially even disappearing) in what amounts to a blink of an eye in cosmic terms.\"We know approximately how old the rings are, but it doesn't solve any of our other problems,\" Kempf said. \"We still don't know how these rings formed in the first place.\"From Galileo to CassiniResearchers have been captivated by these seemingly-translucent rings for more than 400 years. In 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei first observed the features through a telescope, although he didn't know what they were. (Galileo's original drawings make the rings look a bit like the handles on a water jug). In the 1800s, Maxwell, a scientist from Scotland, concluded that Saturn's rings couldn't be solid but were, instead, made up of many individual pieces.Today, scientists know that Saturn hosts seven rings comprised of countless chunks of ice, most no bigger than a boulder on Earth. Altogether, this ice weighs about half as much as Saturn's moon Mimas and stretches nearly 175,000 miles from the planet's surface.Kempf added that for most of the 20th century, scientists assumed that the rings likely formed at the same time as Saturn.But that idea raised a few issues\u2014namely, Saturn's rings are sparkling clean. Observations suggest that these features are made up of roughly 98% pure water ice by volume, with only a tiny amount of rocky matter.\"It's almost impossible to end up with something so clean,\" Kempf said.Cassini offered an opportunity to put a definitive age on Saturn's rings. The spacecraft first arrived at Saturn in 2004 and collected data until it purposefully crashed into the planet's atmosphere in 2017. The Cosmic Dust Analyzer, which was shaped a bit like a bucket, scooped up small particles as they whizzed by.Engineers and scientists at LASP designed and built a much more sophisticated dust analyzer for NASA's upcoming Europa Clipper mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2024.The team estimated that this interplanetary grime would contribute far less than a gram of dust to each square foot of Saturn's rings every year\u2014a light sprinkle, but enough to add up over time. Previous studies had also suggested that the rings could be young but didn't include definitive measures of dust accumulation.      Stroke of luckThe rings might already be vanishing. In a previous study, NASA scientists reported that the ice is slowly raining down onto the planet and could disappear entirely in another 100 million years.That these ephemeral features existed at a time when Galileo and the Cassini spacecraft could observe them seems almost too good to be true, Kempf said\u2014and it begs an explanation for how the rings formed in the first place. Some scientists, for example, have posited that Saturn's rings may have formed when the planet's gravity tore apart one of its moons.\"If the rings are short lived and dynamical, why are we seeing them now?\" he said. \"It's too much luck.\" More information:Sascha Kempf, Micrometeoroid infall onto Saturn's rings constrains their age to no more than a few hundred million years, Science Advances (2023).

  "text": "A lot has changed since the last Space Age. Unlike the days of Sputnik, Vostok, Mercury, and Apollo, the current era is not defined by two superpowers constantly vying for dominance and one-upmanship. More than ever, international cooperation is the name of the game, with space agencies coming together to advance common exploration and science goals.          Similarly, there is the way the private space sector has become a major participant, providing everything from launch services and commercial payloads to satellite constellations and crews.But in some ways, old habits die hard. Since the turn of the century, China has emerged as a major power in space, to the point of becoming a direct competitor with NASA's human space programs. For the past few years, China has been developing a reusable autonomous spaceplane to compete with the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV).Known as Shenlong (\"divine dragon\"), this spaceplane recently concluded its second test flight after spending 276 days in orbit. Though the details are scant, the Chinese state media company Xinua declared the flight a breakthrough for the Chinese space program.The Chinese reusable experimental spaceplane, the Chongfu Shiyong Shiyan Hangtian Qi (CSSHQ), has remained steeped in mystery since it first came to light. During its previous test flight (CSSHQ 1), the spaceplane took off on September 4, 2020, and spent a brief two days in orbit. For its second flight (CSSHQ-2), the Chinese spaceplane took off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert on August 4, 2022, atop a Long March-2F/T rocket (CZ-2) and reportedly landed at Juiquan again on Monday, May 8.The Chinese state news agency Xinhua issued a statement shortly after the spaceplane landed (reportedly in Jiuquan). The spaceplane's manufacturer, the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. (CASC), reshared the Xinhua statement via the Chinese social media platform Weixin:\"The reusable test spacecraft successfully launched by our country at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center successfully returned to the scheduled landing site on May 8 after flying in orbit for 276 days. The complete success of this test marks an important breakthrough in my country's research on reusable spacecraft technology, which will provide a more convenient and inexpensive way to and from the peaceful use of space in the future.\"      No details were given about the mission, the spacecraft, or what operations were conducted in orbit. However, SpaceNews correspondent Andrew Jones recapped the CCSHQ's activities throughout the test flight and recapped them in a recent article.\"The spacecraft performed numerous small and much larger orbital maneuvers during its flight, with adjustments in recent weeks made in preparation for landing,\" he wrote. \"The landing is likely to have taken place at the Lop Nur military base in Xinjiang. Information on the spacecraft's orbit suggests an orbital track over the facility around 0020 UTC provided the opportunity for landing.\"As Jones wrote back in August 2022, the spacecraft also released a small satellite into orbit 90 days into its flight. While the purpose and nature of this satellite are unknown, tracking data obtained by the U.S. Space Force (USSF) revealed that the small satellite remained in very close proximity to the spaceplane. While this flight was a big step for China's research into reusable spacecraft technology, it pales in comparison to the accomplishments of the X-37B, which has executed six test flights since April 2010.During its last flight (OTV-6), the OTV spent over nine-hundred days in space and even deployed a series of science experiments while in orbit. Like the CCSHQ's activities, the details about the OTV's flights have remained highly classified. However, various sources have confirmed that the objectives include developing orbital reconnaissance vehicles for military use and testing reusable spacecraft technologies, hypersonic engines, and autonomous guidance systems.Concerning reusability, China is developing spacecraft as part of a larger program, including a super-heavy launch system similar to SpaceX's Starship.The concept was presented by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT) in April 2021 during the sixth annual Aerospace Industry Achievement Exhibition (aka. \"National Space Day\") in Nanjing.The China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) is also pursuing its own reusable spaceplane, known as the Tengyun (\"cloud rider\"). According to a video released by CASIC during the 2021 Zhuhai Air Show (shown above), this vehicle would be part of a two-stage launch system that relies on an air-launch vehicle (similar to Virgin Galactic).This latest development showcases the progress China has made in recent years. In terms of space station technology, robotic exploration on the Moon (the Chang'e program) and Mars (the Tianwen-1 orbiter and Zhurong rover), and crewed spaceflight, China has emerged as a global powerhouse.Later this decade, China plans to send the first taikonauts to the Moon and establish the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), in direct competition with NASA's Artemis Program. In 2033, they hope to send the first crewed missions to Mars, precisely when NASA is hoping to do the same.

  "text": "A team of theoretical astrophysicists have studied in detail a hypothetical form of dark matter that combines to form dark atoms. They found that the existence of dark atoms can drastically affect the evolution of galaxies.          We don't understand the vast majority of matter in the universe. We call it dark matter, but that's about the best we've got. To the best of our knowledge dark matter is composed of some new kind of particle currently unknown to modern physics. Whatever the particle is, it does not interact with light and it does not interact with normal matter except through the gravitational force.Given our lack of understanding of this mysterious substance, we have a lot of room to play with in our theoretical models. Some of these models suggest that dark matter isn't made of a single species of particle that floods the universe. Instead it can be composed of different many different kinds of particles. There can also be new forces of nature, beyond the four that we are familiar with, that operate only among the dark matter particles.In this picture the various components of dark matter can collect together to form dark atoms, and even molecules and more complex structures. Most importantly, in these models the dark matter can clump together very tightly. A team of researchers used this fact to explore the observational consequences of these models of dark atoms using simulations of the evolution of galaxies.They found that atomic dark matter can very rapidly clump up, forting forming a \"shadow disk\" to go along with the disk of stars in the typical galaxy. From there the dark atoms continue to clump, forming the equivalent of dark stars and dark black holes. It can even quickly sink into the core of the galaxy, rapidly increasing the density there.All of these effects of atomic dark matter would be invisible at cosmological scales. But they would drastically affect the evolution of stars within the galaxy. Stars form from the collapse of material, and any gravitational influence can affect the trajectory of star formation.The researchers found differences in star formation rates and the population and distribution of stars in a galaxy that includes dark atoms versus a galaxy that only includes a single dark matter component. The researchers hope that these results will be useful to further pinning down this mysterious substance that dominates our universe.The research is published on the arXiv preprint server.

  "text": "Did humanity miss the party? Are SETI, the Drake Equation, and the Fermi Paradox all just artifacts of our ignorance about Advanced Life in the universe? And if we are wrong, how would we know?          A new study focusing on black holes and their powerful effect on star formation suggests that we, as advanced life, might be relics from a bygone age in the universe.Universe Today readers are familiar with SETI, the Drake Equation, and the Fermi Paradox. All three are different ways that humanity grapples with its situation. They're all related to the Great Question: Are We Alone? We ask these questions as if humanity woke up on this planet, looked around the neighborhood, and wondered where everyone else was. Which is kind of what has happened.We live in an era of exoplanet discoveries, and astronomers are busy searching for planets that have a possibility of being habitable, i.e., they have liquid surface water. That's a simple definition of habitability, but it's useful for sorting through the thousands of exoplanets we've discovered and the untold millions more waiting to be discovered. Because, the a priori reasoning tells us, individual planets are the key to finding life.But what about a more wide-angle view of habitability and, especially, other advanced life? Is combing through individual planets the way to find other life? Or are certain galaxies themselves more likely to host advanced life, which can take billions of years to evolve? Do the black holes in galaxies affect the likelihood of advanced life?David Garofalo is an associate professor of physics at Kennesaw State University in Georgia. Garofalo researches the physics of black holes, and in a new paper, he explains how black holes could affect the existence of advanced life.The paper is \"Advanced Life Peaked Billions of Years Ago According to Black Holes.\" It's available on the arXiv preprint server and soon to be published in the journal Galaxies. Garofalo is the sole author, and the paper hasn't been peer-reviewed yet.Garofalo explains how black hole feedback can either drive or suppress star formation. Whether it does or not depends on the environment and whether the SMBH is in a gas-sparse or a gas-rich environment.\"The link between black holes and star formation allows us to draw a connection between black holes and the places and times when extraterrestrial intelligences (ETIs) had a greater chance of emerging,\" Garofalo writes.                This figure from the research helps explain what happens in a gas-sparse environment. It starts with a merger of two gas-rich black holes. The accretion disk, shown in blue, is in counter-rotation around a rapidly-spinning black hole. That produces jets that drive star formation rates higher. That lasts about 8 million years. In the middle panel, the disk is tilted, and the jets disappear, so star formation is unaffected. In the right panel, \u201cThe star formation rate dies down as the cold gas reservoir comes to an end and a dead quasar is formed after over a billion years,\u201d Garofalo explains. Credit: Garofalo, 2023             The Drake Equation tries to give form to our ponderings about other intelligent civilizations. It's a probabilistic equation that tries to calculate the number of intelligent and communicative civilizations there are in the Milky Way. Garofalo's effort extends beyond the Milky Way into the universe. But the universe is vast and ancient. Where to begin?Garofalo starts with black holes, feedback, and star formation.\"Our understanding of the processes that determine where and when star formation peaks in the universe has matured significantly, to the point where we can begin to explore more broadly the question of intelligence across space and time,\" Garofalo writes. Black hole feedback affects star formation in galaxies, but the effect varies.Garofalo has researched black holes extensively, and this paper leans heavily on his research and the work of others in the same field. Garofalo claims that advanced life peaked billions of years ago, all because of the direct connection between mergers, black holes, star formation, and the planets that form around those stars. It starts with a black hole merger that's likely to lead to active galactic nuclei (AGN,) which is the term for a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of a galaxy that is accreting enough matter to shine brightly. Some AGN emit jets, and they're dependent on the nature of the matter accreting onto the hole. The matter is the galaxy's gas, and different galaxies have different gas environments.Black hole feedback plays a major role in Garofalo's work. Different black holes drive different types of feedback, and some feedback drives higher rates of star formation. Jets are the primary way that black holes interact with the surrounding medium, pumping matter back out of their accretion disks into their surroundings.Sometimes all that feedback drives star formation. But sometimes, it injects too much energy into its galaxy or galaxy cluster, and that chokes off star formation. It heats up the gas too much, and to collapse and form stars, gas needs to be cold. A core part of Garofalo's work is identifying when black hole feedback drives star formation and when it stifles star formation.Sometimes a black hole's accretion disk is counter-rotating relative to the black hole itself as a result of a merger, and that affects the feedback and the jets. \"Counterrotation is associated with various general relativistic effects that maximize the power and collimation of the jet,\" Garofalo writes. \"This type of jet is funneled through the cold gas and pushes it into states of higher densities, thereby triggering star formation.\"But that counter-rotating accretion disk can slow and then stop the black hole's spin. Eventually, it reverses and speeds it up again. When the black hole is at a zero spin, it ceases to produce jets, and its feedback into the galaxy or galaxy cluster is stalled. The zero spin state also tilts the accretion disk. At that point, \"the incoming gas forms a disk that maintains the angular momentum of the gas reservoir of the greater galaxy,\" Garofalo explains. The zero spin state lasts for different lengths of time depending if the galaxy is sparse in gas or rich in gas. It lasts about eight million years in an environment that is sparse in gas.But things change in a denser, more gas-rich environment. \"In denser environments, instead, the black hole mass tends to be larger, the jet more powerful, and its feedback effect greater,\" Garofalo explains. This is because the way gas accretes onto the disk changes. It adopts a different type of flow than in a sparse environment.                This figure from the research helps explain what happens in a gas-dense environment. The jets re-emerge but are tilted and aimed more directly at the gas in the host galaxy. That heats it up and limits star formation. It also means the galaxy\u2019s gas is hot enough to produce X-rays, a limiting factor for life. Credit: Garofalo, 2023             The different flow means that the black hole in the dense environment takes longer to spin down by two orders of magnitude. The result? \"As a result, on average, the richest environments produce powerful, collimated jets that enhance star formation for a timescale that is about two-orders-of-magnitude longer than in more isolated environments,\" Garofalo writes. Eventually, the spin reaches zero, and the jets cease. Critically, the jets only re-emerge in the denser environment.This is a lot of information for those of us who aren't astrophysicists, but Garofalo clarifies the key part for us, and it comes down to sparse or dense environments. \"The key difference is the presence of only positive AGN feedback in isolated environments, while both positive, then negative feedback, in richer ones.\" The jets only re-emerge in richer or denser environments, but they're tilted. This means they're aimed more directly at the galaxy's gas, and they can heat it up and stifle star formation.In that case, the result is fewer stars. Fewer stars mean fewer planets, which means fewer possibilities for advanced life. But the effect extends beyond the rates of star and planet formation. Since the galaxy's gas is heated, it can give off a halo of X-rays that permeates the galaxy and affects the chemistry of planets, which can inhibit their habitability.That's bad news for advanced life in more gas-dense galaxies and galaxy clusters. Even though there's more gas, the stuff that gives rise to stars, the gas is overheated, stifling star formation.But what about in gas-sparse galaxies and clusters?\"In more isolated environments, by contrast, stars evolve onto the main sequence undisturbed by AGN feedback,\" Garofalo summarizes. This is also critical because we're talking not about just the appearance of life, which may have occurred on Earth in only a few hundred million years. We're talking about advanced life like us, which took 4.5 billion years to appear on Earth. Main sequence stars are the longest-lived, most stable stars, and it's far more probable that advanced life can arise around main sequence stars than other stars.Taking all this into account, Garofalo reframes the Drake Equation to include black hole feedback. \"It tells us where in the universe the chance of detecting advanced life is greatest. The answer is in isolated field environments,\" he explains.But where advanced life can arise is only part of it. Garofalo wanted to find out when it was most likely. It all goes back to the initial black hole mergers that produce counter-rotating accreting black holes. \"Counterrotating accreting black holes are the product of mergers, and the merger function experiences its peak at a redshift of 2,\" he writes. A redshift of 2 was about 11 billion years ago when the universe was 2.8 billion years old.\"This, therefore, is the redshift corresponding to when the greatest number of isolated field galaxies experienced a merger that led to cold gas flowing into the nucleus of the newly formed galaxy and settling into counterrotation around the newly formed black hole,\" Garofalo concludes.That's the age when AGN and their jets appear. They triggered star formation and planet formation. Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago, and we, the advanced life capable of interstellar communication, only just appeared. So using us as a benchmark, it's about 4.5 billion years after the right black holes in the right galaxies that advanced life can appear. Garofalo rounds it off to 5 billion years. \"Thus, we assume a fiducial value of 5 billion years, which brings us to 7.8 billion years after the Big Bang, or 6 billion years ago.\"At this point, an astute reader might wonder about metallicity. There was lower metallicity 6 billion years ago, so wouldn't that have affected the types of planets that form and whether or not advanced life could arise on them?Not necessarily.Garofalo points out that the galaxies where the critical AGN are most likely to exist are isolated elliptical galaxies. But they're not the old red and dead elliptical galaxies. The ones Garofalo is talking about are different. Instead, \"these isolated elliptical galaxies are not expected to harbor low metallicities because they are AGN-triggered by mergers with abundant cold gas, possibly from a disk-like galaxy,\" he explains. The old red and dead elliptical galaxies are also known to be populated with older stars and dominated by M dwarfs or red dwarfs whose habitable zones are \"closer to the star and subject to stellar flares and tidally locked rotation, which work against the development of life,\" Garofalo writes. But the subset of elliptical galaxies he's talking about isn't dominated by red dwarfs.So there we have it. If Garofalo is right, then we need to rethink SETI. \"Given the times and places identified for ETIs in this work, we expect SETI searches to require that signals come from Kardashev Type III civilizations,\" he writes in his conclusion. A Kardashev Type III civilization is one that is able to access all the energy emitted by its galaxy.According to Garofalo's work, humanity is indeed late to the party. \"To the extent that we may someday speak of a peak era for the emergence of technologically advanced life in the universe, our simplified exploration of the emergence of life in the context of AGN feedback indicates that such a time is in the past,\" he concludes. \"We on planet Earth are, therefore, latecomers.\"We may be late, but we aren't necessarily alone. Other partygoers might be just arriving. We're here, so it's possible others are.When it comes to communicating with another advanced civilization, that's an open question. But look at us. Advanced life is still emerging. Maybe two civilizations will contact one another someday.For that to happen, we need to know where to direct our effort in this vast Universe. If this work holds up, it might help advance the search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligences by showing us where to look.And where not to.

  "text": "NASA is targeting Saturday, May 13 (Friday, May 12 in U.S. EDT) to conduct a second super pressure balloon (SPB) test flight launching from W\u0101naka Airport to further test and qualify the technology, which can offer cost savings compared to space missions.          The first super pressure balloon launch carrying the Super Pressure Balloon Imaging Telescope (SuperBIT) continues to perform brilliantly and has been at float for more than 25 days. SuperBIT is currently on its fourth circumnavigation of the southern hemisphere.This second scheduled flight will carry the Extreme Universe Space Observatory 2 (EUSO-2) science mission. EUSO-2, from the University of Chicago, aims to build on data collected during a 2017 mission. The mission will detect ultra-high energy cosmic-ray particles from beyond our galaxy as they penetrate Earth's atmosphere. The origins of these particles are not well known, so the data collected from EUSO-2 will help solve this science mystery.NASA will begin flight preparations in the early morning hours Saturday in New Zealand and continue to evaluate weather conditions in real-time throughout the morning. If weather is conducive for launch, lift-off is scheduled between 8 and 11:30 a.m. locally (between 4 and 7:30 p.m. U.S. EDT Friday, May 12).For subsequent launch attempts, if needed, NASA will announce by 2 p.m. NZST (10 p.m. EDT) if the next day's forecast weather will support a launch attempt.For those in the local area, the public won't be allowed at or to park alongside W\u0101naka Airport on the morning of the launch for flight safety reasons. However, immediately after lift-off, the balloon will be visible for miles around\u2014the best viewing points will be on the hill on the Hawea side of the Red Bridge by Kane Road or on the Hawea Flat side of the Clutha River.The launch can be tracked in the following ways:A live feed of the launch is available here: http://www.ustream.tv/channel/nasa-csbf-downrange-operationsTrack the progress of the flight at the following link, which includes a map showing the balloon's real-time location, at: https://www.csbf.nasa.gov/map/balloon8/flight729NT.htm.Ongoing mission updates are also available on NASA's Super Pressure Balloon blog.

  "text": "Scientists at The Open University (OU) have analyzed isotopic measurements in the atmosphere of Mars, providing new information on the evolution of the Martian climate throughout history and the origin of surface organics on Mars.          The atmosphere of Mars, which is mostly made of carbon dioxide (CO2), is relatively enriched in \"heavy\" carbon (13C) with respect to Earth due to the preferential escape of \"light\" carbon (12C) to space over several billion years.Scientists from the OU's Atmospheric Research and Surface Exploration group have analyzed data from the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) mission, which indicate that Martian carbon monoxide (CO) is depleted in heavy carbon instead.Dr. Juan Alday, lead author of the study which is published in Nature Astronomy, explains, \"The key for understanding why there is less 13C in CO lies in the chemical relationship between CO2 and CO. When CO2 molecules are destroyed by sunlight to form CO, 12CO2 molecules are more efficiently destroyed than 13CO2, leading a depletion of 13C in CO over long periods of time.\"Despite the small amount of CO in the atmosphere of Mars (less than 0.1%), these new measurements have important implications to our understanding of the evolution of the Martian climate and can help determine the historical climate conditions that enabled the presence of liquid water on the surface of early Mars.Dr. Alday commented, \"We do not know what the atmosphere of early Mars was like nor what conditions allowed liquid water to flow on the surface. The isotopes of carbon on Mars' atmosphere can help us estimate how much CO2 there was in the past.\"The new measurements by the ExoMars TGO suggest that less CO2 has escaped the planet than previously thought and provide new constraints on the composition of this early atmosphere of Mars.\"Recent measurements made by NASA's Curiosity Rover on the surface revealed a depletion of 13C in surface organic material.Manish Patel, who leads the OU ExoMars research group, said, \"There is a long-standing debate on whether organic material on the surface of Mars was produced by biological or non-biological processes.\"The fact that both atmospheric CO and surface organics share this 13C-depleted isotopic signature that Juan has measured may indicate these organics are more likely to be non-biological in origin, although other origins cannot be ruled out based solely on this information.\" More information:Juan Alday et al, Photochemical depletion of heavy CO isotopes in the Martian atmosphere, Nature Astronomy (2023).

  "text": "A new study sheds light on the bright outbursts of radiation that are created when a star is destroyed by a supermassive black hole. The outbursts do not necessarily form in the close vicinity of the black hole, but are created by tidal shocks that occur when gas from the destroyed star hits itself while circling the black hole.          The universe is a violent place where even the life of a star can be cut short. This occurs when a star finds itself in a \"bad\" neighborhood, specifically near a supermassive black hole.These black holes weigh millions or even billions of times the mass of the sun and typically reside in the centers of quiet galaxies. As a star moves closer to the black hole, it experiences the ever-increasing gravitational pull of the supermassive black hole until it becomes more powerful than the forces that keep the star together. This results in the star being disrupted or destroyed, an event known as a tidal disruption event (TDE).\"After the star has been ripped apart, its gas forms an accretion disk around the black hole. The bright outbursts from the disk can be observed in nearly every wavelength, especially with optical telescopes and satellites that detect X-rays,\" says Postdoctoral Researcher Yannis Liodakis from the University of Turku and the Finnish Center for Astronomy with ESO (FINCA).Until recently, researchers knew only of a few TDEs, as there were not many experiments capable of detecting them. In recent years, however, scientists have developed the necessary tools to observe more TDEs. Interestingly, but perhaps not too surprisingly, these observations have led to new mysteries that the researchers are currently studying.\"Observations from large-scale experiments with optical telescopes have revealed that a large number of TDEs do not produce X-rays even though the bursts of visible light can be clearly detected. This discovery contradicts our basic understanding of the evolution of the disrupted stellar matter in TDEs,\" Liodakis notes.A study published in the journal Science by an international team of astronomers led by the Finnish Center for Astronomy with ESO suggests that the polarized light coming from TDEs might hold the key to solving this mystery.Instead of the formation of an X-ray bright accretion disk around the black hole, the observed outburst in the optical and ultraviolet light detected in many TDEs can arise from tidal shocks. These shocks form far away from the black hole as the gas from the destroyed star hits itself on its way back after circling the black hole. The X-ray bright accretion disk would form much later in these events.\"Polarization of light can provide unique information about the underlying processes in astrophysical systems. The polarized light we measured from the TDE could only be explained by these tidal shocks,\" says Liodakis, who is the lead author of the study.      Polarized light helped researchers to understand the destruction of starsThe team received a public alert in late 2020 from the Gaia satellite of a nuclear transient event in a nearby galaxy designated as AT 2020mot. The researchers then observed AT 2020mot in a wide range of wavelengths including optical polarization and spectroscopy observations conducted at the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT), which is owned by the University of Turku. The observations conducted at the NOT were particularly instrumental in making this discovery possible. In addition, the polarization observations were done as part of the observational astronomy course for high school students.\"The Nordic Optical Telescope and the polarimeter we use in the study have been instrumental in our efforts to understand supermassive black holes and their environments,\" says Doctoral Researcher Jenni Jormanainen from FINCA and the University of Turku who led the polarization observations and analysis with the NOT.The researchers found that the optical light coming from AT 2020mot was highly polarized and was varying with time. Despite several attempts, none of the radio or X-ray telescopes were able to detect radiation from the event before, during, or even months after the peak of the outburst.\"When we saw how polarized AT2020mot was, we immediately thought of a jet shooting out from the black hole, as we often observe around supermassive black holes that accrete the surrounding gas. However, no jet was there to be found,\" says Elina Lindfors, an Academy Research Fellow at the University of Turku and FINCA.The team of astronomers realized that the data most closely matched a scenario where the stream of stellar gas collides with itself and forms shocks near the pericenter and apocenter of its orbit around the black hole. The shocks then amplify and order the magnetic field in the stellar stream which will naturally lead to highly polarized light. The level of the optical polarization was too high to be explained by most models, and the fact that it was changing over time made it even harder.\"All models we looked at could not explain the observations, except the tidal shock model,\" notes Karri Koljonen, who was an astronomer at FINCA at the time of the observations and is now working at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).The researchers will continue to observe the polarized light coming from TDEs and may soon discover more about what happens after a star is disrupted.

  "text": "A team of astronomers led by the University of Southampton has uncovered the largest cosmic explosion ever witnessed.          The explosion is more than ten times brighter than any known supernova (exploding star) and three times brighter than the brightest tidal disruption event, where a star falls into a supermassive black hole.The explosion, known as AT2021lwx, has currently lasted over three years, compared to most supernovae, which are only visibly bright for a few months. It took place nearly 8 billion light years away, when the universe was around 6 billion years old, and is still being detected by a network of telescopes.The researchers believe that the explosion is a result of a vast cloud of gas, possibly thousands of times larger than our sun, that has been violently disrupted by a supermassive black hole. Fragments of the cloud would be swallowed up, sending shockwaves through its remnants, as well as into a large dusty \"doughnut\" surrounding the black hole. Such events are very rare and nothing on this scale has been witnessed before.Last year, astronomers witnessed the brightest explosion on record\u2014a gamma-ray burst known as GRB 221009A. While this was brighter than AT2021lwx, it lasted for just a fraction of the time, meaning the overall energy released by the AT2021lwx explosion is far greater.The findings of the research have been published today in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.DiscoveryAT2021lwx was first detected in 2020 by the Zwicky Transient Facility in California, and subsequently picked up by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) based in Hawaii. These facilities survey the night sky to detect transient objects that rapidly change in brightness indicating cosmic events such as supernovae, as well as finding asteroids and comets. Until now the scale of the explosion has been unknown.\"We came upon this by chance, as it was flagged by our search algorithm when we were searching for a type of supernova,\" says Dr. Philip Wiseman, Research Fellow at the University of Southampton, who led the research. \"Most supernovae and tidal disruption events only last for a couple of months before fading away. For something to be bright for two plus years was immediately very unusual.\"The team investigated the object further with several different telescopes: the Neil Gehrels Swift Telescope (a collaboration between NASA, the UK and Italy), the New Technology Telescope (operated by the European Southern Observatory) in Chile, and the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Spain.      Measuring the explosionBy analyzing the spectrum of the light, splitting it up into different wavelengths and measuring the different absorption and emission features of the spectrum, the team was able to measure the distance to the object.\"Once you know the distance to the object and how bright it appears to us, you can calculate the brightness of the object at its source. Once we'd performed those calculations, we realized this is extremely bright,\" says Professor Sebastian H\u00f6nig from the University of Southampton, a co-author of the research.The only things in the universe that are as bright as AT2021lwx are quasars\u2014supermassive black holes with a constant flow of gas falling onto them at high velocity.Professor Mark Sullivan, also of the University of Southampton and another co-author of the paper, explains, \"With a quasar, we see the brightness flickering up and down over time. But looking back over a decade there was no detection of AT2021lwx, then suddenly it appears with the brightness of the brightest things in the universe, which is unprecedented.\"What caused the explosion?There are different theories as to what could have caused such an explosion, but the Southampton-led team believes the most feasible explanation is an extremely large cloud of gas (mostly hydrogen) or dust that has come off course from its orbit around the black hole and been sent flying in.The team is now setting out to collect more data on the explosion\u2014measuring different wavelengths, including X-rays which could reveal the object's surface and temperature, and what underlying processes are taking place. They will also carry out upgraded computational simulations to test if these match their theory of what caused the explosion.Dr. Philip Wiseman added, \"With new facilities, like the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, coming online in the next few years, we are hoping to discover more events like this and learn more about them. It could be that these events, although extremely rare, are so energetic that they are key processes to how the centers of galaxies change over time.\" More information:P Wiseman et al, Multiwavelength observations of the extraordinary accretion event AT2021lwx, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (2023).

  "text": "Imagine if sending your science experiment 70,000 ft in the air just took painter's plastic, tape, a dash of charcoal dust, and plenty of sunlight.          Daniel Bowman of Sandia National Laboratories presented his findings using solar-powered hot air balloons to eavesdrop on stratospheric sounds at the 184th Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America on Thursday, May 11.The stratosphere is a relatively calm layer of Earth's atmosphere. Rarely disturbed by planes or turbulence, microphones in the stratosphere pick up a variety of sounds unheard anywhere else. This includes natural sounds from colliding ocean waves and thunder, human-created sounds like wind turbines or explosions, and even sounds with unknown origins.To reach the stratosphere, Bowman and his collaborators build balloons that span 6 to 7 meters across. Despite their large size and data collection capability, the balloons are relatively simple.\"Our balloons are basically giant plastic bags with some charcoal dust on the inside to make them dark. We build them using painter's plastic from the hardware store, shipping tape, and charcoal powder from pyrotechnic supply stores. When the sun shines on the dark balloons, the air inside heats up and becomes buoyant. This passive solar power is enough to bring the balloons from the surface to over 20 km (66,000 ft) in the sky,\" said Bowman. \"Each balloon only needs about $50 worth of materials and can be built in a basketball court.\"The researchers collect data and detect low-frequency sound with microbarometers, which were originally designed to monitor volcanoes. After releasing the balloons, they track their routes using GPS\u2014a necessary task since the balloons sometimes sail for hundreds of miles and land in hard-to-reach places. But, because the balloons are inexpensive and easy to construct and launch, they can release a lot of balloons and collect more data.Along with the expected human and environmental sounds, Bowman and his team detected something they are not able to identify.\"[In the stratosphere,] there are mysterious infrasound signals that occur a few times per hour on some flights, but the source of these is completely unknown,\" said Bowman.Solar-powered balloons could also help explore other planets, such as observing Venus' seismic and volcanic activity through its thick atmosphere.

  "text": "You may know how other planets look, like the rust orange, dusty surface of Mars or the vibrant teal of Uranus. But what do those planets sound like?          Timothy G. Leighton from the University of Southampton in the U.K. designed a software program that produces extraterrestrial environmental sounds and predicts how human voices might change in distant worlds. He demonstrated his work at the 184th Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America on Thursday, May 11.The presentation is part of a special session that brings together the acoustics and planetary science communities. Acoustical studies became essential during the Huygens lander's descent into Titan's atmosphere in 2005 and in the more recent Mars InSight and Mars 2020 missions. These successful missions carried customized active and passive acoustic sensors operating over a wide spectrum, from very low frequencies (infrasound, below the human hearing threshold) to ultrasound (above human hearing).\"For decades, we have sent cameras to other planets in our solar system and learned a great deal from them. However, we never really heard what another planet sounded like until the very recent Mars Perseverance mission,\" said Leighton.Scientists can harness sound on other worlds to learn about properties that might otherwise require a lot of expensive equipment, like the chemical composition of rocks, how atmospheric temperature changes, or the roughness of the ground.Extraterrestrial sounds could also be used in the search for life. At first glance, Jupiter's moon Europa may seem a hostile environment, but below its shell of ice lies a potentially life-sustaining ocean.\"The idea of sending a probe on a seven-year trip through space, then drilling or melting to the seabed, poses mind-boggling challenges in terms of finance and technology. The ocean on Europa is 100 times deeper than Earth's Arctic Ocean, and the ice cap is roughly 1,000 times thicker,\" said Leighton. \"However, instead of sending a physical probe, we could let sound waves travel to the seabed and back and do our exploring for us.\"Planets' unique atmospheres impact sound speed and absorption. For example, the thin, carbon dioxide-rich Martian atmosphere absorbs more sound than Earth's, so distant noises appear fainter. Anticipating how sound travels is important for designing and calibrating equipment like microphones and speakers.Hearing the sound from other planets is beneficial not just for scientific purposes, but also for entertainment. Science-fiction films contain vivid imagery to mimic the look of other worlds but often lack the immersive quality of how those worlds would sound.Leighton's software showcases predictions of the sounds of other worlds at planetariums and museums. In the case of Mars, it includes actual sounds thanks to the U.S./European Perseverance team and China's Zhurong mission.The special session, chaired by Leighton and Andi Petculescu, is the third forum on acoustics in planetary science organized at a meeting of the Acoustical Society of America.\"The success of the first two ASA special sessions on this subject has led to quite a few collaborations between the two communities, a trend that we hope will carry on,\" said Petculescu.

  "text": "There are roughly 7,000 satellites whizzing around Earth, scanning our planet's surface and generating hundreds of terabytes of data every day. These satellites are operated by many different governments and commercial entities, and the data they produce are scattered across different stakeholders with different agendas, making it impossible for any single research team to leverage the full potential of the world's orbital sensors.          Researchers at Stevens Institute of Technology have now created a digital platform that enables dozens of organizations to model information exchanges between fleets of orbital devices and land-based antennae to manage complex Earth science problems such as spotting wildfires. The platform is called the New Observing Strategies Testbed, or NOS-T for short.\"NOS-T gives researchers a way to quickly prototype collaborative space research projects, said Paul Grogan, an associate professor of systems engineering at Stevens who led the project. \"It eliminates many of the challenges that might otherwise prevent these distributed missions from being developed.\"In their work, reported in Systems Engineering, Grogan and colleagues at Stevens describe how networked satellites can be used to generate much more detailed images, giving a vastly better picture of what's happening on the Earth's surface. Using multiple satellites also makes it easier to monitor specific locations continuously, which is important when trying to track wildfires or monitor water-saturated soil to predict landslides. In contrast, individual satellites can only scan the areas they're passing over.NOS-T works by enabling organizations to independently model their own satellites and data, then exchange messages containing limited amounts of approved data. Effectively, NOS-T acts as connective tissue, enabling organizations to connect devices and share data without providing one another with direct access to sensitive information about the data, control algorithms, and other technologies they're using.Such safeguards are the only way to persuade private organizations that it's safe to share data, or to convince governments to put national rivalries aside and collaborate on joint research projects, explained Grogan. \"These kinds of partnerships aren't easy, but if you can't figure out how to work together using a digital simulation, you'll never be able to collaborate on real-world space missions,\" he said.NOS-T will soon be deployed in planning real-world space missions, with NASA's Earth Science and Technology Office set to begin using NOS-T to evaluate mission proposals next year, and some mission designers already using NOS-T to validate new research frameworks before applying for federal funding. \"Using NOS-T, you can check that the distributed aspects of a space project are feasible before you start pouring millions of dollars into building equipment and launching satellites,\" Grogan said.In the future, collaborative digital platforms like NOS-T could help satellites communicate with one another directly, with messages processed by onboard AI algorithms to automatically coordinate sensors around shared research goals. For now, the goal is to streamline the process of developing and validating distributed missions, helping researchers around the world make better use of the data raining down from the world's orbital sensors.\"With the cost of space launches coming down, we're seeing all kinds of organizations starting to put sensors in orbit,\" said Grogan. \"That means the future of space research will have to be collaborative\u2014but first, we need to be able to model and test collaborative relationships just as thoroughly as we test the hardware we're using.\" More information:Brian Chell et al, New observing strategies testbed: A digital prototyping platform for distributed space missions, Systems Engineering (2023).

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the NASA mission that explores Titan's atmosphere?",
  "answer_squad": " Dragonfly",
  "text": "In a little over four years, NASA's Dragonfly mission will launch into space and begin its long journey towards Titan, Saturn's largest moon. As part of the New Frontiers program, this quadcopter will explore Titan's atmosphere, surface, and methane lakes for possible indications of life (aka. biosignatures).          This will commence in 2034, with a science phase lasting for three years and three and a half months. The robotic explorer will rely on a nuclear battery\u2014a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermal Generator (MMRTG)\u2014to ensure its longevity.But what if Dragonfly were equipped with a next-generation fusion power system? In a recent mission study paper, a team of researchers from Princeton Satellite Systems demonstrated how a direct fusion drive (DFD) could greatly enhance a mission to Titan. This New Jersey-based aerospace company is developing fusion systems that rely on the Princeton Field-Reversed Configuration (PFRC).This research could lead to compact fusion reactors that could lead to rapid transits, longer-duration missions, and miniature nuclear reactors here on Earth.The research team was led by Michael Paluszek, the president of Princeton Satellite Systems (PSS) and an aeronautic and astronautical engineer with a long history of experience in space systems and the commercial space industry. He was joined by multiple colleagues from PSS, the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), the Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson AFB, and Princeton and Stanford University. Their mission study, \"Nuclear fusion powered Titan aircraft,\" recently appeared in Acta Astronautica.The concept of nuclear propulsion goes back to the early Space Age when NASA and the Soviet space program sought to develop reactors to power future missions beyond the Earth-moon system. Between 1964 and 1969, their efforts led to the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA), a solid-core reactor that relies on the slow-decay of highly-enriched uranium (235U) to power a nuclear-thermal propulsion (NTP) or nuclear-electric propulsion (NEP) system.The former relies on a reactor to heat deuterium (2H) and liquid oxygen (LOX) propellant, which is then directed through nozzles to generate thrust. The latter involves a reactor providing electricity to a Hall-Effect thruster or ion engine that relies on electromagnetic fields to ionize an inert gas (like xenon) that is directed through nozzles for thrust. In contrast to these traditional nuclear engines, the direct fusion drive (DFD) calls for a nuclear-fusion rocket engine that would produce both thrust and electric power for an interplanetary spacecraft.      In a previous study, an international research team proposed how a spacecraft equipped with a 2-megawatt (MW) DFD could transport a 1000 kg (2200 lbs) payload to Titan in less than 2.6 years (~31 months). This is over twice the mass of the Dragonfly mission, which is (relatively speaking) a featherweight by comparison\u2014450 kg (990 lbs). A transit time of 2.6 years is also significantly less than the seven years the Dragonfly's spacecraft will take to reach Titan.In their paper, Paluszek and his colleagues extended this work to include an aircraft as the payload, which would explore Titan's atmosphere and surface for years. And unlike the Dragonfly's quadcopter design, their Titan aircraft would be a fixed-wing robotic explorer. As Paluszek told Universe Today via email, the key to this spacecraft concept is the PFRC reactor concept developed by researchers at the PPPL:\"The Princeton Field Reversed Configuration is a magnetic topology in which fields, produced by antennas, close the field lines within a magnetic mirror. The antennas produce what is called a rotating magnetic field (RMF). Fusion takes place in this closed field region. Additional lower-temperature plasma streams around the fusion region to produce an exhaust stream with the best exhaust velocity and thrust for a given mission.\"According to their paper, a DFD propulsive engine could transport a sizable spacecraft to Titan in less than two years. A second fusion reactor would power the Titan spacecraft as a closed-loop electrical power generator. Both reactors would be based on the PFRC concept and rely on a novel radio-frequency plasma heating system and deuterium/helium-3 (2H/3He) fuel. This would give the Titan aircraft significantly more power (by several orders of magnitude) and greatly extend the life of the mission. Said Paluszek:\"The Titan aircraft is much larger. It provides over 100 kW for experiments. Dragonfly supplies about 70 W. More power means faster data transfer to Earth and a whole new class of high-power instruments. The NASA Jupiter Icy moon Orbiter mission had a similar amount of power, and many novel instruments that required kWs of power were planned.\"Utilizing nuclear power to advance space exploration is something that space agencies have been investigating since the dawn of the Space Age. With the Artemis Program and the return to the moon in this decade, and missions to Mars and other deep-space destinations in the next, NASA and other space agencies are once again considering potential applications. These include bimodal nuclear spacecraft equipped with an NTP and NEP system that could reduce transits to Mars to 100 days (it currently takes six to nine months for spacecraft to travel there).An NTP system was recently selected for Phase I development as part of the 2023 NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program that could reduce transit times to as little as 45 days. In addition, NASA has contracted with DARPA to test an NTP prototype\u2014the Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO)\u2014in orbit by 2027. There are also efforts to develop small, lightweight fission systems through NASA's Fission Surface Power (FSP) project to continuously provide up to 10 kilowatts (kW) of power for at least ten years.These latter efforts build on NASA's Kilopower project, which led to the Kilopower Reactor Using Stirling TechnologY (KRUSTY) demonstrator. As Paluszek explained, a DFD that relies on the PFRC reactor design could drastically improve on these proposals. What's more, the technology has significant implications for space exploration and terrestrial applications as well:\"A key number is the ratio of power to power plant mass. DFD should be around 1 kW/kg. NEP is about 0.02 kW/kg. This tech could be used for portable power for emergencies or for the military. It could power remote towns that don't have a grid-tie [and] for industrial applications where a grid-tie is not available. It could power ships and very long-endurance drone aircraft. It could also be used for modular power plants, much like wind turbines and solar. Another application is peaking power.\"This is not the first time that Paluszek and his colleagues at the PPPL and Princeton Satellite Systems have proposed DFD technology to advance space exploration. In 2014, as part of the 65th International Astronautical Congress (IAC), they recommended a DFD spacecraft for a crewed orbital mission to Mars. In 2016, they proposed how a DFD-equipped orbiter and lander would facilitate a mission to Pluto, which was selected for Phase I and Phase II development by the NIAC.In the coming decade, nuclear propulsion and nuclear power systems will likely become regular mission features. This will likely include miniature fusion reactors that provide power for facilities that support exploration and development on the lunar surface. It could also provide for rapid transportation and power systems on Mars and astrobiology missions to Europa, Ganymede, Titan, Enceladus, and other ocean worlds in the outer solar system. In summary, fission and fusion power are a vital part of humanity's efforts to go further into space and stay there long-term.

  "text": "Thanks to data from a magnified, multiply imaged supernova, a team led by University of Minnesota Twin Cities researchers has successfully used a first-of-its-kind technique to measure the expansion rate of the universe. Their data provide insight into a longstanding debate in the field and could help scientists more accurately determine the universe's age and better understand the cosmos.          The work is divided into two papers, respectively published in Science and The Astrophysical Journal.In astronomy, there are two precise measurements of the expansion of the universe, also called the \"Hubble constant.\" One is calculated from nearby observations of supernovae, and the second uses the \"cosmic microwave background,\" or radiation that began to stream freely through the universe shortly after the Big Bang.However, these two measurements differ by about 10 percent, which has caused widespread debate among physicists and astronomers. If both measurements are accurate, that means scientists' current theory about the make-up of the universe is incomplete.\"If new, independent measurements confirm this disagreement between the two measurements of the Hubble constant, it would become a chink in the armor of our understanding of the cosmos,\" said Patrick Kelly, lead author of both papers and an assistant professor in the University of Minnesota School of Physics and Astronomy.

A first appearance occurred according to model predictions in the host galaxy image at the upper left in the late 1990s but was missed. We detected images S1\u2013S4 in an Einstein-cross configuration in 2014 November (Kelly et al. 2015). Following this appearance, lens modelers predicted the SN's reappearance, which was detected in late 2015 (Kelly et al. 2016c).

DOI: 10.3847/1538-4357/ac4ccb             \"The big question is if there is a possible issue with one or both of the measurements. Our research addresses that by using an independent, completely different way to measure the expansion rate of the universe.\"The University of Minnesota-led team was able to calculate this value using data from a supernova discovered by Kelly in 2014\u2014the first ever example of a multiply imaged supernova, meaning that the telescope captured four different images of the same cosmic event. After the discovery, teams around the world predicted that the supernova would reappear at a new position in 2015, and the University of Minnesota team detected this additional image.These multiple images appeared because the supernova was gravitationally lensed by a galaxy cluster, a phenomenon in which mass from the cluster bends and magnifies light. By using the time delays between the appearances of the 2014 and 2015 images, the researchers were able to measure the Hubble Constant using a theory developed in 1964 by Norwegian astronomer Sjur Refsdal that had previously been impossible to put into practice.      The researchers' findings don't absolutely settle the debate, Kelly said, but they do provide more insight into the problem and bring physicists closer to obtaining the most accurate measurement of the universe's age.\"Our measurement favors the value from the cosmic microwave background, although it is not in strong disagreement with the supernova value,\" Kelly said. \"If observations of future supernovae that are also gravitationally lensed by clusters yield a similar result, then it would identify an issue with the current supernova value, or with our understanding of galaxy-cluster dark matter.\"Using the same data, the researchers found that some current models of galaxy-cluster dark matter were able to explain their observations of the supernovae. This allowed them to determine the most accurate models for the locations of dark matter in the galaxy cluster, a question that has long plagued astronomers.

  "text": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are the brightest millisecond-duration cosmic explosions in radio bands. Their unknown origin poses challenges for astronomy as well as physics.          The Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey (CRAFTS), a key program of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), discovered the world's first persistently active repeating FRB, known as FRB 20190520B. Now this FRB has provided clues that may help clarify the origin of FRBs.An international team led by Dr. Li Di from the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC) carried out a monitoring campaign of FRB 20190520B, using the Parkes telescope in Australia and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in the United States. The combined analyses have revealed an extreme field reversal around this constantly bursting source.The study, based on observational efforts across three continents, was published in Science on May 11.Unlike all other FRBs, FRB 20190520B has produced bursts, detectable by at least one and sometimes multiple telescopes, every time it was viewed. Such reliability makes it an ideal target for multiband follow-up observational studies.\"A total of 113 bursts from FRB 20190520B were detected by the Parkes telescope, exceeding the sum of the number of fast radio bursts previously discovered at Parkes, accentuating the value of FRB 20190520B,\" said Dr. Dai Shi from Western Sydney University, PI of the FRB 20190520B project at Parkes.Through a combined analysis of data from GBT and Parkes, Dr. Feng Yi, an NAOC Ph.D. graduate now at Zhejiang Laboratory, and Ms. Reshma Anna-Thomas from West Virginia University (WVU) measured its polarization properties and found that the Faraday rotation measure (RM) twice changed its sign in dramatic fashion: from ~10,000 units to ~-10,000 units and vice versa. Other key contributors include Dr. Liam Connor from Caltech and Dr. Sarah Burke-Spolaor from WVU.During the propagation of a burst signal, the polarization characteristics can be affected by the surrounding plasma. \"The RM can be approximated by the integral product of magnetic field and electron density. Variation in RM can be caused by either factor, but a sign change has to arise from the reversal of magnetic fields, as the electron density cannot go negative,\" said Dr. Li Di, corresponding author of the study.This reversal could result from propagation through a turbulent, magnetized screen of plasma located between 10-5 to 100 parsecs of the FRB source. \"The turbulent components of the magnetic field around repeating fast radio bursts may be as messy as a ball of wool,\" said Prof. Yang Yuanpei from Yunnan University, a co-author of the study.The likely scenario for producing such a mess includes the signal passing through the halo of a companion, be it a blackhole or a massive star with winds. Understanding drastic changes in the magnetized environment around the FRB is an important step toward understanding the origin of such cosmic explosions.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the rover that is exploring the top of a fan-shaped pile of sedimentary rock?",
  "answer_squad": " Perseverance",
  "text": "New images taken by NASA's Perseverance rover may show signs of what was once a rollicking river on Mars, one that was deeper and faster-moving than scientists have ever seen evidence for in the past. The river was part of a network of waterways that flowed into Jezero Crater, the area the rover has been exploring since landing more than two years ago.          Understanding these watery environments could help scientists in their efforts to seek out signs of ancient microbial life that may have been preserved in Martian rock.Perseverance is exploring the top of a fan-shaped pile of sedimentary rock that stands 820 feet (250 meters) tall and features curving layers suggestive of flowing water. One question scientists want to answer is whether that water flowed in relatively shallow streams\u2014closer to what NASA's Curiosity rover has found evidence of in Gale Crater\u2014or a more powerful river system.Stitched together from hundreds of images captured by Perseverance's Mastcam-Z instrument, two new mosaics suggest the latter, revealing important clues: coarse sediment grains and cobbles.\"Those indicate a high-energy river that's truckin' and carrying a lot of debris. The more powerful the flow of water, the more easily it's able to move larger pieces of material,\" said Libby Ives, a postdoctoral researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which operates the Perseverance rover. With a background in studying Earth-based rivers, Ives has spent the last six months analyzing images of the Red Planet's surface. \"It's been a delight to look at rocks on another planet and see processes that are so familiar,\" Ives said.Following the curvesYears ago, scientists noticed a series of curving bands of layered rock within Jezero Crater that they dubbed \"the curvilinear unit.\" They could see these layers from space but are finally able to see them up close, thanks to Perseverance.One location within the curvilinear unit, nicknamed \"Skrinkle Haven,\" is captured in one of the new Mastcam-Z mosaics. Scientists are sure the curved layers here were formed by powerfully flowing water, but Mastcam-Z's detailed shots have left them debating what kind: a river such as the Mississippi, which winds snakelike across the landscape, or a braided river like Nebraska's Platte, which forms small islands of sediment called sandbars.When viewed from the ground, the curved layers appear arranged in rows that ripple out across the landscape. They could be the remnants of a river's banks that shifted over time\u2014or the remnants of sandbars that formed in the river. The layers were likely much taller in the past. Scientists suspect that after these piles of sediment turned to rock, they were sandblasted by wind over the eons and carved down to their present size.      \"The wind has acted like a scalpel that has cut the tops off these deposits,\" said Michael Lamb of Caltech, a river specialist and Perseverance science team collaborator. \"We do see deposits like this on Earth, but they're never as well exposed as they are here on Mars. Earth is covered in vegetation that hides these layers.\"A second mosaic captured by Perseverance shows a separate location that is part of the curvilinear unit and about a quarter mile (450 meters) from Skrinkle Haven. \"Pinestand\" is an isolated hill bearing sedimentary layers that curve skyward, some as high as 66 feet (20 meters). Scientists think these tall layers may also have been formed by a powerful river, although they're exploring other explanations, as well.\"These layers are anomalously tall for rivers on Earth,\" Ives said. \"But at the same time, the most common way to create these kinds of landforms would be a river.\"The team is continuing to study Mastcam-Z's images for additional clues. They're also peering below the surface, using the ground-penetrating radar instrument on Perseverance called RIMFAX (short for Radar Imager for Mars' Subsurface Experiment). What they learn from both instruments will contribute to an ever-expanding body of knowledge about Mars' ancient, watery past.\"What's exciting here is we've entered a new phase of Jezero's history. And it's the first time we're seeing environments like this on Mars,\" said Perseverance's deputy project scientist, Katie Stack Morgan of JPL. \"We're thinking about rivers on a different scale than we have before.\" Provided byJPL/NASACitation:Images from NASA's Perseverance may show record of wild Martian river (2023, May 11)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-images-nasa-perseverance-wild-martian.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Stars living closest to the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way have no stellar companions, a new study finds.          Using W. M. Keck Observatory on Maunakea, Hawai\u02bbi Island, Devin Chu of Hilo, an astronomer with the UCLA Galactic Center Orbits Initiative, led a 10-year survey that found these \"S-stars,\" where \"S\" stands for Sagittarius A*, the name of the monster black hole at our galaxy's core, are all single.The result is surprising given the S-stars Chu's team observed included young, massive main-sequence stars that are only about six million years old. Normally, stars at this age that are 10 times more massive than our Sun spend their childhood years paired with a twin in a binary system, or sometimes even as triplets.\"This discovery speaks to the incredibly interesting environment of the Galactic Center,\" said Chu, who is the lead author of the study published in today's issue of The Astrophysical Journal. \"It is likely the supermassive black hole's powerful influence causes binary star systems to either merge or become disrupted, where a companion star gets kicked out from the region. This may explain why we don't see any stars with partners so close to Sagittarius A*.\"The decade-long survey marks the first systematic search for binary systems within the S-star cluster.Using Keck Observatory's adaptive optics system paired with its OH-Suppressing Infrared Imaging Spectrograph (OSIRIS), Chu and his team tracked the motions of 28 S-stars; 16 of which are young, main-sequence B-type stars and the rest are low-mass, old M-type and K-type giant stars.\"Keck's adaptive optics and OSIRIS have been crucial in providing us the infrared insight we needed to peer through the Galactic Center dust as well as distinguish the individual S-stars in this very crowded region,\" said Chu.Not only did they find the S-stars flying solo, the researchers were also able to calculate the limit on how many of these S-stars could exist as binaries, a metric known as the binary fraction. They discovered the young S-star binary fraction limit is 47 percent, meaning for every 100 S-stars, a maximum of 47 of them could be in binary systems. This limit is dramatically lower than what is expected for similar types of young stars in Earth's solar neighborhood, which have a binary fraction of 70 percent.The finding suggests stars with companions have a difficult time staying together in the extreme environment of the Milky Way's supermassive black hole.The discovery adds to the already exotic nature of S-stars, whose births remain a mystery. A black hole's tidal forces typically disrupt traditional star formation, raising questions as to how S-stars managed to develop within the dangerous cosmic whirlpool Sagittarius A* creates.\"I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to study these bizarre and fascinating stars from my home island,\" said Chu. \"Some of the data used for this survey was taken while I was a student at Hilo Intermediate and High School! It feels incredibly rewarding to be able to conduct groundbreaking science while returning home to Hawai\u02bbi.\" More information:Devin S.

  "answer_squad": " two million years",
  "text": "Globular clusters are the most massive and oldest star clusters in the universe. They can contain up to 1 million stars. The chemical composition of these stars, born at the same time, shows anomalies that are not found in any other population of stars. Explaining this specificity is one of the great challenges of astronomy.          After having imagined that supermassive stars could be at the origin, a team from the Universities of Geneva and Barcelona, and the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris (CNRS and Sorbonne University) believes it has discovered the first chemical trace attesting to their presence in globular proto-clusters, born about 440 million years after the Big Bang. These results, obtained thanks to observations by the James Webb Space Telescope, are published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.Globular clusters are very dense groupings of stars distributed in a sphere, with a radius varying from a dozen to a hundred light years. They can contain up to 1 million stars and are found in all types of galaxies. Ours is home to about 180 of them. One of their great mysteries is the composition of their stars: why is it so varied? For instance, the proportion of oxygen, nitrogen, sodium and aluminum varies from one star to another. However, they were all born at the same time, within the same cloud of gas. Astrophysicists speak of \"abundance anomalies.\"Monsters with short livesA team from the universities of Geneva (UNIGE) and Barcelona, and the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris (CNRS and Sorbonne University) has made a new advance in the explanation of this phenomenon. In 2018, it had developed a theoretical model according to which supermassive stars would have \"polluted\" the original gas cloud during the formation of these clusters, enriching their stars with chemical elements in a heterogeneous manner.\"Today, thanks to the data collected by the James Webb Space Telescope, we believe we have found a first clue of the presence of these extraordinary stars,\" explains Corinne Charbonnel, a full professor in the Department of Astronomy at the UNIGE Faculty of Science, and first author of the study.These celestial monsters are 5,000 to 10,000 times more massive and five times hotter at their center (75 million \u00b0C) than the sun. But proving their existence is complex. \"Globular clusters are between 10 and 13 billion years old, whereas the maximum lifespan of superstars is two million years. They therefore disappeared very early from the clusters that are currently observable. Only indirect traces remain,\" explains Mark Gieles, ICREA professor at the University of Barcelona and co-author of the study.Revealed by lightThanks to the very powerful infrared vision of the James Webb telescope, the co-authors were able to support their hypothesis. The satellite captured the light emitted by one of the most distant and youngest galaxies known to date in our universe. Located at about 13.3 billion light-years, GN-z11 is only a few tens of millions of years old. In astronomy, the analysis of the light spectrum of cosmic objects is a key element in determining their characteristics. Here, the light emitted by this galaxy has provided two valuable pieces of information.\"It has been established that it contains very high proportions of nitrogen and a very high density of stars,\" says Daniel Schaerer, associate professor in the Department of Astronomy at the UNIGE Faculty of Science, and co-author of the study.This suggests that several globular clusters are forming in this galaxy and that they still harbor an active supermassive star. \"The strong presence of nitrogen can only be explained by the combustion of hydrogen at extremely high temperatures, which only the core of supermassive stars can reach, as shown by the models of Laura Ramirez-Galeano, a Master's student in our team,\" explains Corinne Charbonnel.These new results strengthen the international team's model. The only one currently capable of explaining the abundance anomalies in globular clusters. The next step for the scientists will be to test the validity of this model on other globular clusters forming in distant galaxies, using the James Webb data. More information:C.

  "text": "Using ESO's Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA), astronomers have created a vast infrared atlas of five nearby stellar nurseries by piecing together more than one million images. These large mosaics reveal young stars in the making, embedded in thick clouds of dust. Thanks to these observations, astronomers have a unique tool with which to decipher the complex puzzle of stellar birth.          \"In these images we can detect even the faintest sources of light, like stars far less massive than the sun, revealing objects that no one has ever seen before,\" says Stefan Meingast, an astronomer at the University of Vienna in Austria and lead author of the new study published in Astronomy & Astrophysics. \"This will allow us to understand the processes that transform gas and dust into stars.\"Stars form when clouds of gas and dust collapse under their own gravity, but the details of how this happens are not fully understood. How many stars are born out of a cloud? How massive are they? How many stars will also have planets?To answer these questions, Meingast's team surveyed five nearby star-forming regions with the VISTA telescope at ESO's Paranal Observatory in Chile. Using VISTA's infrared camera VIRCAM, the team captured light coming from deep inside the clouds of dust. \"The dust obscures these young stars from our view, making them virtually invisible to our eyes. Only at infrared wavelengths can we look deep into these clouds, studying the stars in the making,\" explains Alena Rottensteiner, a Ph.D. student also at the University of Vienna and co-author of the study.The survey, called VISIONS, observed star-forming regions in the constellations of Orion, Ophiuchus, Chamaeleon, Corona Australis and Lupus. These regions are less than 1,500 light-years away and so large that they span a huge area in the sky. The diameter of VIRCAM's field of view is as wide as three full moons, which makes it uniquely suited to map these immensely big regions.The team obtained more than one million images over a period of five years. The individual images were then pieced together into the large mosaics released here, revealing vast cosmic landscapes. These detailed panoramas feature dark patches of dust, glowing clouds, newly-born stars and the distant background stars of the Milky Way.Since the same areas were observed repeatedly, the VISIONS data will also allow astronomers to study how young stars move. \"With VISIONS we monitor these baby stars over several years, allowing us to measure their motion and learn how they leave their parent clouds,\" explains Jo\u00e3o Alves, an astronomer at the University of Vienna and Principal Investigator of VISIONS.This is not an easy feat, as the apparent shift of these stars as seen from Earth is as small as the width of a human hair seen from 10 kilometers away. These measurements of stellar motions complement those obtained by the European Space Agency's Gaia mission at visible wavelengths, where young stars are hidden by thick veils of dust.The VISIONS atlas will keep astronomers busy for years to come. \"There is tremendous long-lasting value for the astronomical community here, which is why ESO steers Public Surveys like VISIONS,\" says Monika Petr-Gotzens, an astronomer at ESO in Garching, Germany, and co-author of this study.Moreover, VISIONS will set the groundwork for future observations with other telescopes such as ESO's Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), currently under construction in Chile and set to start operating later this decade. \"The ELT will allow us to zoom into specific regions with unprecedented detail, giving us a never-seen-before close-up view of individual stars that are currently forming there,\" concludes Meingast.

  "answer_race": " New Extending Galactic Tail",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the galaxy that was discovered by a team of astronomers?",
  "answer_squad": " Kite",
  "text": "An international team of astronomers reports the discovery of a new enigmatic galaxy system as part of the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. The newfound system consists of a pair of galaxies and an extended highly collimated tail of gas and stars. The finding was reported May 2 on the arXiv pre-print server.          Galactic tails may be a signature of a process or event acting to transform galaxies. Therefore, the discovery and study of these features could help us better understand how galaxies form and evolve.Now, a group of astronomers led by Dennis Zaritsky of the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona, has discovered a new extraordinary galactic tail with a variety of interesting features. The tail is associated with a binary galaxy system.First, the researchers serendipitously detected a new edge-on S0/a galaxy that received designation PGC 1000273, during a search for low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies. Due to its morphology, PGC 1000273 was dubbed the \"Kite\" galaxy and the observations found that it is located some 610 million light years away.Furthermore, a companion galaxy to Kite was identified about 186,000 light years away from it. The companion, designated PGC 070409, or Mrk 0926, is an active galaxy with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) at its center. The Kite-Mrk 0926 was found to have a long galactic tail consisting of gas and stars, which also hosts a small galaxy dubbed \"Kite A,\" which does not show evidence for ongoing star formation.\"We present the discovery of an extraordinary tail emanating from what we have dubbed the Kite galaxy,\" the researchers wrote in the paper.The tail was found to have a projected length of about 1,240 light years and has a length to width ratio of 40. The images show that all of the identified knots of emission along the tail scatter in position angle by less than 3 degrees.Therefore, the length, narrowness, and linearity of the newfound tail make it an unusual example of a galactic tail. The Kite's tail is the longest optical galactic tail so far detected. The only even longer galactic structures are some radio-detected, head-tail systems that can reach lengths greater than 2,000 light years.What makes the Kite's tail extraordinary is that it is sufficiently gas-rich to support star formation along its length even though it originates from an S0/a galaxy, which is expected to be gas-poor. Moreover, the tail lies in a low-density galactic environment with no cluster or group nearby but is in a close binary galaxy system where both galaxies are known to host AGNs.Trying to explain the origin of the detected extended tail, the authors of the paper concluded that the most plausible scenario is the one in which a three-body encounter between the Kite, Mrk 0926, and Kite A resulted in the rapid ejection of the smallest galaxy.\"We propose that the tail resulted from a three-body interaction from which the lowest-mass galaxy was ejected at high velocity....

  "text": "An international team of astronomers including several Dutch researchers has observed, for the first time, the benzene molecule (C6H6) in a planet-forming disk around a young star. Besides benzene, they saw many other, smaller carbon compounds and few oxygen-rich molecules. The observations suggest that, like our own Earth, the rocky planets forming in this disk contain relatively little carbon. The scientists published their findings in the journal Nature Astronomy.          The researchers studied the young, small star J160532 (one tenth of the mass of our sun) some 500 light years away from us towards the constellation Scorpio. Around such small young stars, many rocky planets similar to Earth form, in disks made of gas and dust. Until now, it has been difficult to study molecules in the warm inner part of these disks where the majority of planets form due to the limited sensitivity and spectral resolution of previous observatories.For their research, the scientists used data from the MIRI spectrometer aboard the James Webb Space Telescope. MIRI can see right through dust clouds and is particularly well suited to measure hot gas in inner disks. The main optics of the MIRI spectrometer were designed and built by the Netherlands Research School for Astronomy (NOVA).\"This is exactly the kind of science the MIRI spectrometer was designed for,\" says Ewine van Dishoeck (Leiden University), who has been involved in building Webb and the MIRI instrument from the beginning. \"The spectra contain a wealth of data that tell us something about the chemical and physical composition of planet-forming disks.\"Lots of carbon gas, little oxygenBesides the first ever observation of benzene in a planet-forming disk, the researchers also saw the hydrocarbon diacetylene (C4H2) for the first time, and an unusually large amount of acetylene gas (C2H2), a very reactive hydrocarbon. Strikingly, there is very little water and carbon dioxide in this disk. Those oxygen-rich compounds are often found in other dust disks, though. Identifying these molecules required close collaboration with chemists who measure the spectra (the chemical fingerprints) in the laboratory.The researchers suspect that the benzene and (di-)acetylene are released in the disk following the destruction of carbon-rich dust grains by the active young star. The dust grains that remain would contain silicates with relatively little carbon. In a later phase, the low-carbon grains clump together into larger chunks. These eventually become rocky planets like Earth. This scenario may explain why our own Earth is so poor in carbon.Fifty disks to goMeanwhile, the researchers are working out the data from more than 30 other dust disks around young stars and data on 20 more disks are expected this year. In doing so, they are expected to discover other molecules and gain more knowledge about the formation of planets around stars from the very smallest ones to those that are 2\u20133 times the mass of our sun.Lead author of the study Beno\u00eet Tabone (now CNRS researcher at Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay in France and previously affiliated Leiden University) says, \"This work is only a first glimpse of the physical and chemical conditions in which earth-like planets like our Earth are formed.\"Co-author Aditya Arabhavi, Ph.D. student at the University of Groningen, adds, \"Many more molecules will be discovered, either in the disk of J160532 or in other disks.

  "answer_squad": " inflationary period",
  "text": "Researchers have discovered a new generic production mechanism of gravitational waves generated by a phenomenon known as oscillons, which can originate in many cosmological theories from the fragmentation into solitonic \"lumps\" of the inflaton field that drove the early universe's rapid expansion, reports a new study published in Physical Review Letters on May 2.          The results have set the stage for revealing exciting novel insights about the universe's earliest moments.The inflationary period, which occurred just after the Big Bang, is believed to have caused the universe to expand exponentially. In many cosmological theories, the rapid expansion period is followed by the formation of oscillons.Oscillons are a type of localized non-linear massive structure that can form from fields, such as the inflaton field, which are oscillating at high frequencies. These structures can persist for long periods, and as the researchers found, their eventual decay can generate a significant amount of gravitational waves, which are ripples in space-time.In their study, Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (Kavli IPMU) Project Researcher Kaloian D. Lozanov, and Kavli IPMU Visiting Associate Scientist, International Center for Quantum-field Measurement Systems for Studies of the Universe and Particles (QUP) Senior Scientist, and High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) Theory Center Assistant Professor Volodymyr Takhistov, simulated the evolution of the inflaton field during the early universe and found that oscillons were indeed present. They then found that oscillon decay was able to generate gravitational waves that would be detectable by upcoming gravitational wave observatories.The findings provide a novel test of the early universe dynamics independent of the conventionally studied cosmic microwave background radiation. The discovery of these gravitational waves would establish a new window into the universe's earliest moments, and could help shed light on some of the pressing fundamental questions in cosmology.With the ongoing development of gravitational wave detectors and supercomputing resources, we can expect to gain even more insights into the universe's early moments in the coming years. Overall, the new study demonstrates the power of combining theoretical models with advanced computational techniques and observations to uncover new insights into the universe's evolution.

  "text": "Researchers led by Ph.D. candidate Zang Lei and Prof. Qian Shengbang from Yunnan Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have discovered that the orbital period of the persistent supersoft X-ray source QR Andromeda (QR And) is continuously increasing. The orbital evolution of QR And is mainly caused by the mass transfer from the low-mass companion to the white dwarf on its Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz timescale.          This work was published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.QR And is the optically brightest galactic supersoft X-ray source, where mass is transferred from a donor secondary to a massive white dwarf primary via an accretion disk.To further study their mass exchange and orbital evolution, the researchers analyzed the orbital period variation of QR And in detail, by using the continuous Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curves and the photometric observations collected by American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) database. They found that the orbital period is continuously increasing.Moreover, based on the results of previous research, the researchers estimated that the mass of the donor secondary is about 0.5 solar mass by detailed analysis, while the white dwarf mass is about 1.2 solar masses.\"Therefore, the continuous increase in the orbital period is mainly caused by the mass transfer from the low-mass companion to the white dwarf on its Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz time-scale, while wind mass loss from the accretion disk may also contribute to the period variation,\" said Zang.The mass and angular momentum carried off by wind from the accretion disk delay expansion of the orbit for QR And. Thus, the companion star with a low mass can always be filling its critical Roche lobe and transferring material to the white dwarf.The researchers also estimated the range of mass transfer rate for QR And in this scenario, and roughly estimated that QR And may reach to the Chandrasekhar limit in at least 1.5 million years, then might explode as a type Ia supernova.

  "answer_squad": " Swift",
  "text": "More than a hundred blazars\u2014distant and active galaxies with a central supermassive black hole that drives powerful jets\u2014have been newly characterized by Penn State researchers from a catalog of previously unclassified high-energy cosmic emissions. The new blazars, which are dim relative to more typical blazars, have allowed the researchers to test a controversial theory of blazar emissions, informing our understanding of black hole growth and even theories of general relativity and high-energy particle physics.          A paper describing the blazars and the theory has been accepted for publication in  The Astrophysical Journal, and the peer-reviewed accepted version appears online on the preprint server arXiv.Supermassive black holes can be millions or billions of times the mass of our sun. In some cases, matter outside of the black hole's event horizon is propelled in a jet, accelerating to nearly the speed of light and sending emissions across the universe. When the jet happens to be pointed directly at the Earth, the system is typically called a blazar.\"Because the jet of a blazar is pointed directly at us, we can see them from much farther away than other black hole systems, similar to how a flashlight appears brightest when you're looking directly at it,\" said Stephen Kerby, graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State and first author of the paper.\"Blazars are exciting to study because their properties allow us to answer questions about supermassive black holes throughout the universe. In this study, we used relatively new methods to characterize 106 dim blazars and test the predictions of a contentious theory called the 'blazar sequence.'\"Blazars emit light across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from lower-energy wavelengths such as radio, infrared and visible light, up to higher-energy wavelengths like X-rays and gamma rays. When astronomers study observations of these emissions, they typically see two broad peaks, one in gamma rays and one at lower-energy wavelengths.The wavelengths and the intensity of these peaks varies from blazar to blazar and with time. An overarching theory of blazars defined by the \"blazar sequence\" predicts that the lower-energy peak for brighter blazars will, on average, be redder\u2014lower energy\u2014than that of dimmer blazars, while the lower-energy peak for dim blazars will be bluer\u2014higher energy.\"Some of the most exciting and extreme blazars are discovered by detecting their gamma-ray emission, but we can't usually classify or understand these objects without further multiwavelength observations,\" said Abe Falcone, research professor of astronomy and astrophysics and the lead of a high energy astrophysics group at Penn State.      \"With our currently operating telescopes, it's actually very difficult to detect and classify the lower-energy peaked\u2014red\u2014blazars that are also dim, whereas it is much easier to find these blazars when their peaks are at higher energies or when they are bright. So, with this research, we are minimizing a selection bias and exploring the blazar sequence by delving deeper into lower luminosities of both the low-energy and high-energy peaked blazars.\"The researchers, alongside Amanpreet Kaur\u2014associate research professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State at the time of the research\u2014previously identified potential blazars from a catalog of gamma-ray sources detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, many of which had not yet been paired up with lower-energy emissions that may have come from the same source.For each of the blazars, the researchers then identified these counterpart emissions in X-ray, UV, and optical\u2014detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, whose Mission Operations Center is located at Penn State\u2014and in infrared and radio emissions from archival data. Cross-referencing the information ultimately allowed the researchers to characterize the spectra of 106 new, dim blazars.\"The Swift telescope observations allowed us to pinpoint the positions of these blazars with much more precision than with the Fermi data alone,\" said Kerby. \"Pulling together all this emission data, combined with two new technical approaches, helped us identify where in the electromagnetic spectrum the low-energy peak occurs for each of the blazars, which, for example, can provide information about the strength of the jet's magnetic field, how fast the charged particles are moving, and other information.\"To identify where this peak occurred for the dim blazars, the researchers used machine-learning and direct physical fitting approaches, each of which, according to Kerby, has advantages and disadvantages. The machine-learning approach filters out emissions that might actually be noise, such as from dust in the galaxy or light from other stars. The direct physical fitting approach does not filter out noise and is considerably more difficult to use but provides more detailed properties of the blazar jet.\"For both approaches, the emissions of our sample of dim blazars generally peaks in the blue, higher-energy light, though the fitting approach produced less extreme values,\" said Kerby.\"This is in agreement with the blazar sequence and extends what we know about this pattern. However, there are still a thousand Fermi unassociated sources for which we have found no X-ray counterpart, and it's a fairly safe assumption that many of those sources are also blazars that are just too dim in the X-rays for us to detect. We can use the lessons we've learned here about the shape of these blazar's spectra to make predictions about the blazars that are still too dim for us to detect, which would further test the blazar sequence.\"The catalog of new blazars is available for other astronomers to study in detail.\"It's important to always work to expand our datasets to reach dimmer and dimmer sources, because it makes our theories more complete and less prone to failures from unexpected biases,\" said Kerby. \"I'm excited for new telescopes to probe even dimmer blazars in the future.\"According to the researchers, studying supermassive black holes also provides a unique way to understand the physical theories in the universe.\"Supermassive black holes, and their surroundings, are cosmic laboratories that are far more energetic than anything we can produce in particle accelerators on Earth,\" said Falcone. \"They provide us with opportunities to study theories of relativity, to better understand how particles behave at high energies, to study potential sources of cosmic rays that arrive here on Earth, and to study the evolution and formation of supermassive black holes and their jets.\" More information:Stephen Kerby et al, Testing the Blazar Sequence with Spectra of Recently Discovered Dim Blazars from the Fermi Unassociated Catalog, arXiv (2023).

  "text": "Astronomers have found that supermassive black holes obscured by dust are more likely to grow and release tremendous amounts of energy when they are inside galaxies that are expected to collide with a neighboring galaxy. The new work, led by researchers from Newcastle University, is published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.          Galaxies, including our own Milky Way, contain supermassive black holes at their centers. They have masses equivalent to millions, or even billions, times that of our Sun. These black holes grow by 'eating' gas that falls on to them. However, what drives the gas close enough to the black holes for this to happen is an ongoing mystery.One possibility is that when galaxies are close enough together, they are likely to be gravitationally pulled towards each other and 'merge' into one larger galaxy.In the final stages of its journey into a black hole, gas lights up and produces a huge amount of energy. This energy is typically detected using visible light or X-rays. However, the astronomers conducting this study were only able to detect the growing black holes using infrared light. The team made use of data from many different telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope and infrared Spitzer Space Telescope.The researchers developed a new technique to determine how likely it is that two galaxies are very close together and are expected to collide in the future. They applied this new method to hundreds of thousands of galaxies in the distant universe (looking at galaxies formed 2 to 6 billion years after the Big Bang) in an attempt to better understand the so-called 'cosmic noon', a time when most of the Universe's galaxy and black hole growth is expected to have taken place.Understanding how black holes grew during this time is fundamental in modern day galactic research, especially as it may give us an insight into the supermassive black hole situated inside the Milky Way, and how our galaxy evolved over time.As they are so far away, only a small number of cosmic noon galaxies meet the required criteria to get precise measurements of their distances. This makes it very difficult to know with high precision if any two galaxies are very close to each other.This study presents a new statistical method to overcome the previous limitations of measuring accurate distances of galaxies and supermassive black holes at cosmic noon. It applies a statistical approach to determine galaxy distances using images at different wavelengths and removes the need for spectroscopic distance measurements for individual galaxies.Data arriving from the James Webb Space Telescope over the coming years is expected to revolutionize studies in the infrared and reveal even more secrets about how these dusty black holes grow.Sean Dougherty, postgraduate student at Newcastle University and lead author of the paper, says, \"Our novel approach looks at hundreds of thousands of distant galaxies with a statistical approach and asks how likely any two galaxies are to be close together and so likely to be on a collision course.\"Dr. Chris Harrison, co-author of the study, \"These supermassive black holes are very challenging to find because the X-ray light, which astronomers have typically used to find these growing black holes, is blocked, and not detected by our telescopes. But these same black holes can be found using infrared light, which is produced by the hot dust surrounding them.\"He adds, \"The difficulty in finding these black holes and in establishing precise distance measurements explains why this result has previously been challenging to pin down these distant 'cosmic noon' galaxies. With JWST we are expecting to find many more of these hidden growing black holes. JWST will be far better at finding them, therefore we will have many more to study, including ones that are the most difficult to find. From there, we can do more to understand the dust that surrounds them, and find out how many are hidden in distant galaxies.\" More information:Sean L Dougherty et al, Obscured AGN enhancement in galaxy pairs at cosmic noon: evidence from a probabilistic treatment of photometric redshifts, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (2023).

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the book that Hawking and I created?",
  "answer_squad": " On the Origin of Time: Stephen Hawking's Final Theory",
  "text": "The late physicist Stephen Hawking first asked me to work with him to develop \"a new quantum theory of the Big Bang\" in 1998. What started out as a doctoral project evolved over some 20 years into an intense collaboration that ended only with his passing on March 14 2018.          The enigma at the center of our research throughout this period was how the Big Bang could have created conditions so perfectly hospitable to life. Our answer is being published in a new book, \"On the Origin of Time: Stephen Hawking's Final Theory.\"Questions about the ultimate origin of the cosmos, or universe, take physics out of its comfort zone. Yet this was exactly where Hawking liked to venture. The prospect\u2014or hope\u2014to crack the riddle of cosmic design drove much of Hawking's research in cosmology. \"To boldly go where Star Trek fears to tread\" was his motto\u2014and also his screen saver.Our shared scientific quest meant that we inevitably grew close. Being around him, one could not fail to be influenced by his determination and optimism that we could tackle mystifying questions. He made me feel as if we were writing our own creation story, which, in a sense, we did.In the old days, it was thought that the apparent design of the cosmos meant there had to be a designer\u2014a God. Today, scientists instead point to the laws of physics. These laws have a number of striking life-engendering properties. Take the amount of matter and energy in the universe, the delicate ratios of the forces, or the number of spatial dimensions.Physicists have discovered that if you tweak these properties ever so slightly, it renders the universe lifeless. It almost feels as if the universe is a fix\u2014even a big one.But where do the laws of physics come from? From Albert Einstein to Hawking in his earlier work, most 20th-century physicists regarded the mathematical relationships that underlie the physical laws as eternal truths. In this view, the apparent design of the cosmos is a matter of mathematical necessity. The universe is the way it is because nature had no choice.Around the turn of the 21st century, a different explanation emerged. Perhaps we live in a multiverse, an enormous space that spawns a patchwork of universes, each with its own kind of Big Bang and physics. It would make sense, statistically, for a few of these universes to be life-friendly.However, soon such multiverse musings got caught in a spiral of paradoxes and no verifiable predictions.      Turning cosmology inside outCan we do better? Yes, Hawking and I found out, but only by relinquishing the idea, inherent in multiverse cosmology, that our physical theories can take a God's-eye view, as if standing outside the entire cosmos.It is an obvious and seemingly tautological point: cosmological theory must account for the fact that we exist within the universe. \"We are not angels who view the universe from the outside,\" Hawking told me. \"Our theories are never decoupled from us.\"We set out to rethink cosmology from an observer's perspective. This required adopting the strange rules of quantum mechanics, which governs the microworld of particles and atoms.According to quantum mechanics, particles can be in several possible locations at the same time\u2014a property called superposition. It is only when a particle is observed that it (randomly) picks a definite position. Quantum mechanics also involves random jumps and fluctuations, such as particles popping out of empty space and disappearing again.In a quantum universe, therefore, a tangible past and future emerge out of a haze of possibilities by means of a continual process of observing. Such quantum observations don't need to be carried out by humans. The environment or even a single particle can \"observe\".Countless such quantum acts of observation constantly transform what might be into what does happen, thereby drawing the universe more firmly into existence. And once something has been observed, all other possibilities become irrelevant.We discovered that when looking back at the earliest stages of the universe through a quantum lens, there's a deeper level of evolution in which even the laws of physics change and evolve, in sync with the universe that is taking shape. What's more, this meta-evolution has a Darwinian flavor.Variation enters because random quantum jumps cause frequent excursions from what's most probable. Selection enters because some of these excursions can be amplified and frozen, thanks to quantum observation. The interplay between these two competing forces\u2014variation and selection\u2014in the primeval universe produced a branching tree of physical laws.The upshot is a profound revision of the fundamentals of cosmology. Cosmologists usually start by assuming laws and initial conditions that existed at the moment of the Big Bang, then consider how today's universe evolved from them. But we suggest that these laws are themselves the result of evolution.Dimensions, forces, and particle species transmute and diversify in the furnace of the hot Big Bang\u2014somewhat analogous to how biological species emerge billions of years later\u2014and acquire their effective form over time.Moreover, the randomness involved means that the outcome of this evolution\u2014the specific set of physical laws that makes our universe what it is\u2014can only be understood in retrospect.In some sense, the early universe was a superposition of an enormous number of possible worlds. But we are looking at the universe today at a time when humans, galaxies and planets exist. That means we see the history that led to our evolution.We observe parameters with \"lucky values\". But we are wrong to assume they were somehow designed or always like that.The trouble with timeThe crux of our hypothesis is that, reasoning backward in time, evolution towards more simplicity and less structure continues all the way. Ultimately, even time and, with it, the physical laws fade away.This view is especially borne out of the holographic form of our theory. The \"holographic principle\" in physics predicts that just as a hologram appears to have three dimensions when it is in fact encoded in only two dimensions, the evolution of the entire universe is similarly encoded on an abstract, timeless surface.Hawking and I view time and causality as \"emergent qualities\", having no prior existence but arising from the interactions between countless quantum particles. It's a bit like how temperature emerges from many atoms moving collectively, even though no single atom has temperature.One ventures back in time by zooming out and taking a fuzzier look at the hologram. Eventually, however, one loses all information encoded in the hologram. This would be the origin of time\u2014the Big Bang.For almost a century, we have studied the origin of the universe against the stable background of immutable laws of nature. But our theory reads the universe's history from within and as one that includes, in its earliest stages, the genealogy of the physical laws. It isn't the laws as such but their capacity to transmute that has the final word.Future cosmological observations may find evidence of this. For instance, precision observations of gravitational waves\u2014ripples in the fabric of spacetime\u2014may reveal signatures of some of the early branches of the universe. If spotted, Hawking's cosmological finale may well prove to be his greatest scientific legacy.

This crinkled ground then encounters chains of 'pit craters': features where strings of circular or near-circular depressions have combined and coalesced to form troughs. We see these on Earth too, with a notable example being the dramatic Cenotes found on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, Mexico. The pit crater troughs and chains shown here have also grouped together to form an especially large and eye-catching collapse area.These chains and troughs likely form where hidden voids lie below the surface, causing ground to become unstable and collapse\u2014a bit like a sinkhole. The subsurface voids are thought to be created as the surface layer of a lava flow rapidly cools and hardens; the lava flow beneath then ceases and ebbs away over time, leaving tube-shaped pockets of space lurking several meters below ground.The ground to the left of the pit crater chains is marked by so-called 'sinuous rilles': smaller, snaking channels without rims that are often found at the flanks of volcanoes. It is still unclear how these form, but their creation may involve flows of lava, ash or water\u2014or a combination of the three.The leftmost part of the image is dominated by large fissures of up to 40 km long. Branching out from these fissures are channels that weave and braid together ('braided channels'), isolating chunks of Martian terrain to form 'islands' and terraces. These are likely to have formed by water\u2014perhaps as snow and ice built up on the flanks of Ascraeus Mons before later melting away.                Broader view of Ascraeus Mons.

  "text": "In space, cataclysmic events happen to stars all the time. Some explode as supernovae, some get torn apart by black holes, and some suffer other fates. But when it comes to planets, stars turn the tables. Then it's the stars who get to inflict destruction.          Expanding red giant stars consume and destroy planets that get too close, and a new study takes a deeper look at the process of stellar engulfment.Stars like our sun will eventually become red giants. Through nuclear fusion, they convert mass into energy (E=mc2, right?) Over their lifetimes, they shed so much mass as energy that they eventually expand and turn red. For planets that are too close to these swollen spheres, it spells the end. They're eventually engulfed and completely destroyed.A lot of research has delved into the planetary engulfment process, and a new study calculated one in ten evolved stars in the Milky Way will swallow Jupiter-mass planets.The study is titled \"Giant planet engulfment by evolved giant stars: light curves, asteroseismology, and survivability.\" The first author is Christopher O'Connor. O'Connor is a Ph.D. student at the Department of Astronomy at Cornell University. The study has not been peer-reviewed yet and is available on the arXiv server.The study focuses on two types of evolved stars that are closely related: red giant branch (RGB) stars and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The two are similar, and in fact, RGB stars can become AGB stars. The term evolved star is descriptive enough to cover both, and in this work, the important thing is that RGB stars and AGB stars have both left the main sequence.As these evolved stars lose mass, they expand, and at this stage, any planets in close proximity are in peril. The star's convective envelope swells and ensnares the planet. This creates drag, which causes the planet to spiral inward toward the star. Astronomers know this, and in this work, the authors examined the frequency of these events and how the stars respond.They describe a sun-like star as a star with 1 to 2 solar masses. About 10% of these stars will engulf a planet between 1 to 10 Jupiter masses. For these mass relationships, the in-spiral will take between 10 and 100 years or between 100 and 1000 orbits.      To determine these ranges and how the star responds, the researchers used an open-source astronomy software tool called MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics.) \"We use the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software instrument to track the stellar response to the energy deposition while simultaneously evolving the planetary orbit,\" they explain. MESA revealed how the different evolved stars responded to engulfing planets with different masses.While many astrophysical events play out over thousands, millions, or even hundreds of millions of years, planetary engulfment is a much quicker process. But before the planet and star come into contact, two things draw them together: stellar expansion and orbital decay. This is the first phase of the engulfment, where tidal friction causes the planet's orbital decay. The authors explain that the tidal friction is \"most likely due to turbulent dissipation in the star's convective envelope.\" At this point in the process, drag from the stellar corona and the stellar wind are minimal.Once the star and planet start to come into contact with one another, things change. Tidal friction takes a back seat to drag forces. The authors call this the \"grazing\" phase. \"The 'grazing' hydrodynamical interaction of the star and planet is complex and three-dimensional,\" they write. The complexities in the grazing phase can include phenomena like the expulsion of matter from the star and optical and X-ray transients triggered by shocks. But this study leaves those phenomena aside for now. \"We focus on the later 'inspiral' phase of engulfment, when the planet is completely immersed in the envelope,\" they write.                This figure from the paper shows heat deposited in stars in the later inspiral phase. The RGBs and AGBs in the legend are modelled host stars with different masses. The x-axis shows planetary mass, and the y-axis shows the amount of heat deposited. Clearly, the more massive the planet, the more heat is deposited. Credit: O\u2019Connor et al. 2023             When a planet is in the inspiral phase, it deposits heat into the star. The latter part of this phase is called the late inspiral phase, and the heat added to the star during this phase is largely responsible for the star's response. The mass of the planet is a determining factor in how much heat is deposited.The engulfments cause the stellar envelope to expand and contract, though not monotonically. A given mass shell can expand and contract multiple times during the event. The researchers say the planet can be visualized as a local heat source in the shell, and the source is moving toward the star's center. This movement, and other properties of the star, create varied expansions and contractions.This research agrees with previous research showing that planet engulfment leads to optical and infrared bursts in luminosity. The power and duration of these bursts are largely determined by the mass of the planet and the star, though other factors like rotation can come into play. The researchers found that for all RGB stars, and for AGB stars engulfing planets up to five Jupiter masses, the star brightens considerably in only a few years.The researchers' overall results show that for both types of evolved stars engulfing a planet on the low side of the range, up to three Jupiter masses, the changes to the stellar structure are mild to moderate. The star's brightness rises by up to one magnitude in only a few years. Brighter stars can experience a double peak.For stars in the later stages of the AGB, the engulfed planet can create a major disturbance in the star's outer layers. It can trigger supersonic expansion of the star's outer layers. In this case, the stars can resemble Luminous Red Novae (LRN) as they produce bright, red, dusty eruptions.                This figure from the study shows the changes in radius and magnitude for one of the host stars modelled in the study. The top panel shows how a star can expand and contract multiple times during engulfment. The bottom panel shows how the star\u2019s magnitude changes. Credit: O\u2019Connor et al. 2023             Regardless of the type of star, the mass of the planet, and how the star responds to the engulfment, the planet's fate is always the same: tidal disruption.This study has limited applicability to our solar system. Our sun will become a red giant in a few billion years, but unless something extremely disruptive happens before then, Jupiter is out of reach. Instead, the inner rocky planets face engulfment.This study is based on simulations rather than observations, but the simulations could help astronomers identify the real thing when it happens. Engulfments are transient events, and some existing and future telescopes and observatories focus entirely on transients and time-domain astronomy. When the Vera Rubin Observatory comes online around August 2024, it'll spot a multitude of transient events, some of which will be evolved stars engulfing Jupiter-mass planets.The results of this study could help spot them.

  "text": "To better understand observations of the most distant galaxies, an international team of astronomers has built a sample of local galaxies which can be studied in much higher detail. In a newly published study they show how the amount of light that escapes from a galaxy is connected to its physical properties. The result has implication for how we interpret observations of galaxies in the early universe.          One of the most informative ways to study galaxies in the early universe is through a particular type of ultraviolet light called \"Lyman alpha.\" This light is emitted from gas around the hottest stars, and is therefore particularly good for observing galaxies that are highly star-forming.Unlike other types of light, however, the exact wavelength and direction of traveling depends on many physical processes inside and outside the galaxies. Lyman alpha light doesn't just travel directly towards our telescopes, but takes on a complicated path out of the galaxy.On its way, it travels through regions of different physical conditions which affect not only the path individual light particles take, but also changes their wavelength and even absorb an unspecified fraction of the light.Some regions are hotter, some are more dusty, some have strong flows of gas clouds, etc. All these physical conditions makes it notoriously difficult to interpret the Lyman alpha light that we see. On the other hand the reward, if interpreted correctly, is substantial, exactly because we can then learn about the physics of the galaxy.                Lyman alpha photons are emitted from gas around stars, but on their way out of the galaxy they hit thousands or even millions of hydrogen atoms. At each interaction, they change direction and wavelength randomly. Credit: Peter Laursen/Cosmic Dawn Center.             Spying on our neighborsGalaxies in the distant universe are faint and small, and hence particularly difficult to observe. An international team of astronomers therefore set out to built a \"reference\" sample of galaxies in our local neighborhood. While still hundreds of millions of lightyears away, they are near enough that they can be studied in great detail, with many different telescopes around the world and in space.This so-called Lyman Alpha Reference Sample, or LARS, has revealed many interesting properties of galaxies that are extremely helpful when observing the more distant ones. In the latest study, led by Jens Melinder, Senior Researcher at the University of Stockholm, and published in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, the astronomers deduced how much of the Lyman alpha light escapes the galaxy, and whether or not this fraction correlated with various physical properties of the galaxy.      \"With the new observations, we have established a connection between how much Lyman alpha escapes the galaxies, and several of the physical properties of these galaxies,\" explains Melinder. \"For instance, there is a clear correlation between the amount of cosmic dust a galaxy has, and how much Lyman it lets out. This was expected, because dust absorbs light, but now we have quantified the effect.\"The astronomers also found a connection between the escaping light and the total mass of all the stars in the galaxy, although less explicit. On the other hand other properties, such as the amount of new stars that the galaxy forms, did not seem to correlate with the amount of Lyman alpha that escapes the galaxy.                Two galaxies from the LARS sample, here observed through filters that enhance specific physical processes: Green colors show light from the stars. Red shows where the Lyman alpha photons are\u00a0emitted, and blue shows where they are\u00a0observed, i.e. where they escape the galaxies\u00a0(colors \"add\", so e.g. white means that all three colors are present). It is clear that the Lyman alpha photons do not travel directly toward our telescopes, but are \"trapped\" inside the galaxies until they are eventually able to escape quite far away, creating a \"halo\" of Lyman alpha light in the outskirts of the galaxies. Credit: Melinder et al. (2023)             Another interesting result is that galaxies observed in Lyman alpha appear considerably larger than when observed at other wavelengths. This effect has been seen before, and is in line with the theoretical expectations.\"We see the same effect in computer simulations of galaxies with calculations of how Lyman alpha travels through the gaseous clouds in interstellar space,\" explains Peter Laursen from the Cosmic Dawn Center who also participated in the study. \"This confirms that we have a rather good theoretical understanding of the physics at play.\"This effect is important to take into account when observing distant galaxies where light from the outskirts of the galaxies is too faint to be detected, or falls outside of the detectors.The quantification of the effect will be helpful in future observations of the most distant and hence earliest galaxies:\"These results will help in interpreting observations of very distant, but similar, galaxies observed with the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes,\" says Melinder. \"Understanding the detailed astrophysics of this type of galaxies is crucial for developing theories of how the first galaxies formed and evolved.\" More information:Jens Melinder et al, The Ly\u03b1 Reference Sample.

  "text": "Vacations can be quite enjoyable. Visiting historic cities, lounging in the sun on a tropical beach, or snuggling up at a cozy mountain resort. But while the destinations are great, traveling itself can be a chore. Crowds, cramped flights, delays. It would be great if there were some short cut to our destination. Now imagine the vacationers of a galactic empire. It's great to visit the diamond shores of Exoticon 5, but nobody enjoys all that mucking about in hyperspace. So why not bring these worlds closer to home? That's the idea behind a study recently published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. It basically looks at how a super-advanced civilization might pack a bunch of planets into the habitable zone of a single star.          One of the downsides of habitable zones is that they tend to have a fairly narrow distance range. In our solar system, for example, Venus is too close to the sun, and Mars is too distant for either of them to be solidly in the sun's habitable zone. If we become a super advanced species in the future, we might nudge the Venusian and Martian orbits closer to Earth, but that could raise some problems of its own. In particular, if the orbits are too similar, gravitational perturbations could make all three orbits unstable over the course of thousands of years, which would ruin the whole point of re-engineering our system.Fortunately, there is a way to have two worlds share very similar orbits. We see this with two moons of Saturn, Epimetheus and Janus. Most of the time one of them has a slightly closer orbit to Saturn, which means it speeds along faster until it almost catches up to the other. The two moons then do a little gravitational dance, where the outer moon is pulled inward, and the inner moon outward. So the two moons never collide, even though they essentially share the same orbit. Relative to Epimetheus, Janus traces a horseshoe-shaped path, which is why these are called horseshoe orbits.In principle, two Earth-like worlds orbiting a sun-like star could have mutual horseshoe orbits, thus sharing a common habitable zone. There are examples of small bodies being captured into a horseshoe orbit with Earth, but they tend to be unstable. The orbits become more stable if they are of similar mass.For this study, the team wanted to find out how many worlds could be packed into a similar orbit. They started with the assumption that all worlds would be Earth-mass, and they would orbit a sun-like star at 1 au. They found that as you add more planets the orbits become a bit more variable, but it is possible to pack as many as 24 Earth worlds into stable horseshoe resonances. The orbits of these worlds would be stable for billions of years with the right set-up.The team went further to study how such a system might look from light-years away. If the orbits of such a system were aligned to pass in front of their star from our vantage point, we could detect them as exoplanets using the transit method. Such an odd system could prove the existence of an advanced civilization.We aren't likely to discover such an unusual system, but it is a wild idea to contemplate, particularly if you try to imagine what our night sky would look like if it were filled with 23 other Earths. That would definitely be worth a vacation to a dark-sky location to take in the view.

  "text": "Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CME) are two of the most energetic processes in the solar system, showering the Earth's magnetic field with billions of tons of highly energetic plasma gas, potentially disrupting power grids, satellites and communications networks. Understanding the underlying particle acceleration process involved in large solar energetic particle (SEP) events like these has been one of the central problems in heliophysics research.          Dr. Gang Li, a professor in the Department of Space Science at The University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), is the first author of a paper in The Astrophysical Journal titled \"Modeling Solar Energetic Neutral Atoms from Solar Flares and CME-driven Shocks\" that demonstrates\u2014for the first time\u2014how energetic neutral atoms, or ENAs, could be used as a new means to probe the acceleration process in large SEP events, as well as to differentiate between the two acceleration sites: large loops in solar flares and downstream of CME-driven shocks.\"This work is likely to excite the [heliophysics] community to consider more about the generation and propagation of solar ENA particles,\" Dr. Li says. \"The paper demonstrates for the first time that ENAs can be used to distinguish between CME/Flare SEP acceleration, laying down the necessary theoretical groundwork for possible future measurement of solar ENAs.\"\"Dr. Li's work provides a groundbreaking new approach to exploring the physics of particle acceleration in the atmosphere of the sun remotely,\" says Dr. Gary Zank, director of UAH's Center for Space Plasma and Aeronomic Research and the Aerojet Rocketdyne chair of the Department of Space Science.\"This expands the already substantial effort in the Department of Space Science of using ENAs to explore remote regions of the heliosphere, where we utilize ENAs created in the distant boundaries of the heliosphere and neighboring interstellar medium to explore the plasma physics of those regions.\"\"The ultimate goal of using ENAs is to obtain various physics parameters at the acceleration sites,\" Dr. Li notes. \"Scientists know that particles can be accelerated at two possible locations: either solar flares or CME-driven shock. However, which site is more efficient in accelerating particles? Which site can accelerate particles to higher energies? These are often debated questions, and we do not know the answer.\"      The main barrier to solving these mysteries through experimental observation is the sun itself, as basic understanding of near-sun conditions and the physical processes involved in the production of SEP events is hampered by an inability to make direct measurements near the acceleration sites.ENAs represent a potential new method for supplying answers, because they are neutral particles (hydrogen atoms) that are formed from protons from change exchange reactions. Because they are neutral, they are not affected by magnetic fields.\"This is very important, because these neutral particles are not affected by the solar wind MHD [magnetohydrodynamic] turbulence as they propagate from the sun to observers,\" Dr. Li explains. \"In comparison, protons, ions and electrons, because they are charged, their propagation from the sun to the Earth is distorted by the solar wind magnetic field. ENAs therefore carry all the physics information of the acceleration site. So, observing them offers an entirely new opportunity to constrain the underlying particle acceleration process.\"Also, the energetic atoms can reveal their secrets at a distance of 1 astronomical unit, or about 150 million kilometers from the sun, where the flux of the ENAs are at a level that can still be measured by a dedicated ENA detector. The quest to retrieve this data could ultimately lead to a new NASA solar mission to better understand these particles and how large SEP events originate to impact the Earth's magnetosphere.\"Our simulation forms a theoretical basis for interpreting future ENA observations,\" Dr. Li notes. \"Such observations are likely on the radar of NASA as a future mission, for example, the NASA SMEX mission, to dedicate to solar ENA study. A dedicated ENA mission that filters out the more numerous charged SEPs and goes directly after these ENA measurements can provide new information about SEP acceleration near the sun and help solve long-standing questions that have baffled the community.\"In fact, a new NASA mission on which Dr. Zank is a co-investigator, called IMAP (Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe), will in fact have ENA instruments at 1 astronomical unit capable of measuring ENAs created both in the distant reaches of the heliosphere and also originating from the sun.

  "text": "For more than a decade, astronomers have been trying to get a closer look at GJ 1214b, an exoplanet 40 light-years away from Earth. Their biggest obstacle is a thick layer of haze that blankets the planet, shielding it from the probing eyes of space telescopes and stymying efforts to study its atmosphere.          NASA's new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) solved that issue. The telescope's infrared technology allows it to see planetary objects and features that were previously obscured by hazes, clouds or space dust, aiding astronomers in their search for habitable planets and early galaxies.A team of researchers used JWST to observe GJ 1214b's atmosphere by measuring the heat it emits while orbiting its host star. Their results, published in the journal Nature on May 10, 2023, represent the first time anyone has directly detected the light emitted by a sub-Neptune exoplanet\u2014a category of planets that are larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune.Though GJ 1214b is far too hot to be habitable, researchers discovered that its atmosphere likely contains water vapor\u2014possibly even significant amounts\u2014and is primarily composed of molecules heavier than hydrogen. University of Maryland Associate Professor of Astronomy Eliza Kempton, lead author of the study, said their findings mark a turning point in the study of sub-Neptune planets like GJ 1214b.\"I've been on a quest to understand GJ 1214b for more than a decade,\" Kempton said. \"When we received the data for this paper, we could see the light from the planet just disappear when it went behind its host star. That had never before been seen for this planet or for any other planet of its class, so JWST is really delivering on its promise.\"A 'new light'Sub-Neptunes are the most common type of planet in the Milky Way, though none exist in our solar system. Despite the murkiness of GJ 1214b's atmosphere, Kempton and her co-authors determined the planet was still their best chance of observing a sub-Neptune's atmosphere because of its bright but small host star.In their paper, the researchers measured the infrared light that GJ 1214b emitted over the course of about 40 hours\u2014the time it takes the planet to orbit its star. As day turns to night, the amount of heat that shifts from one side of a planet to the other depends largely on what its atmosphere is made of. Known as a phase curve observation, this research method opened a new window into the planet's atmosphere.\"JWST operates at longer wavelengths of light than previous observatories, which gives us access to the heat emitted by the planet and allows us to create a map of the planet's temperature,\" Kempton said. \"We finally got to see GJ 1214b in a new light.\"By measuring the movement and fluctuation of heat, the researchers determined that GJ 1214b does not have an atmosphere dominated by hydrogen.      Potential water world? The question of whether GJ 1214b contains water has long interested astronomers. Previous observations by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope suggested that GJ 1214b could be a water world\u2014a loose term for any planet that contains a significant amount of water.The latest JWST data revealed traces of water, methane or some mix of the two. These substances match a subtle absorption of light seen in the wavelength range observed by JWST. Further studies will be needed to determine the exact makeup of the planet's atmosphere, but Kempton said the evidence remains consistent with the possibility of large amounts of water.\"GJ 1214b, based on our observations, could be a water world,\" Kempton said. \"We think we detect water vapor, but it's challenging because water vapor absorption overlaps with methane absorption, so we can't say 100% that we detected water vapor and not methane. However, we see this evidence on both hemispheres of the planet, which heightens our confidence that there really is water there.\"Reflecting on the findingsThe researchers made another surprising discovery in their study: GJ 1214b is incredibly reflective. The planet was not as hot as expected, which tells researchers that something in the atmosphere is reflecting light.Kempton said there is plenty of room for follow-up studies, including ones that take a closer look at the high-altitude aerosols that form the haze\u2014or possibly clouds\u2014in GJ 1214b's atmosphere. Previously, researchers thought it might be a dark, soot-like substance that absorbs light. However, the discovery that the exoplanet is reflective raises new questions.\"Whatever is making up the hazes or clouds is not what we expected. It's bright, it's reflective and that's confusing and surprising,\" Kempton said. \"This is going to point us toward a lot of further studies to try to understand what those hazes could be.\" More information:Eliza Kempton et al, A reflective, metal-rich atmosphere for GJ 1214b from its JWST phase curve, Nature (2023).

The report highlights the importance of including these considerations right at the first moments of decision making.\"Panels including over 100 scientists from across Europe fed into the report and a series of public consultations were also held to ensure that it reflected the breadth of views within astronomy.These established key priorities, such as understanding the origin of the Universe and the evolution of planets in our solar system, as well as making recommendations on the facilities and resources needed to meet these priorities.In making its recommendations, the report considers recently published visions provided by the European Space Agency, NASA, and advisory bodies such as the particle astrophysics consortium.The aim of the report is to create an openly accessible resource for policymakers and science leaders to support informed decisions that more effectively and efficiently direct scientific discovery.The previous ASTRONET Science Vision and Infrastructure Roadmap (published in 2007 and revised in 2015) included recommendations which fed into proposals for projects such as:The European Southern Observatory (ESO) Extremely Large Telescope in ChileThe Square Kilometre Array Observatory, which is headquartered at Jodrell Bank near ManchesterThese and other recommended initiatives have gone on to receive significant UK support and involvement.Through recommendations such as these, the ASTRONET Roadmap has become a valuable source of information for the benefit of the entire research community.The recommendations of the latest report include:Timely construction of the Cherenkov Telescope Array to detect very high energy gamma rays from black holes and other extreme phenomenaAdoption of the European Space Agency Athena and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna missions to study black holes, detect and accurately measure gravitational waves from astronomical sources and moreDevelopment of second-generation instruments to enhance the capability of the ESO Extremely Large TelescopeIntroduction of more robust environmental footprint assessments for astronomical research and greater consideration of how to reduce the environmental impact of space scienceInvesting in people to guarantee our ability to foster scientific and technological advances in astronomyResearchers at UCL Physics & Astronomy as well as the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at UCL have key roles in many of the initiatives and facilities discussed in the roadmap.Dr. Colin Vincent, STFC Associate Director of Astronomy and Chair of the ASTRONET board, said, \"Astronomy is a necessarily international field and so, while it is important that individual nations set their own priorities, a common view is essential to enable world class programs and capabilities, with European leadership.\"\"We are living through an incredibly exciting time for science with game-changing space missions like the James Webb Space Telescope redefining our understanding of our place in the Universe.\"It is imperative that we build on this momentum by taking a strategic view of how we can combine efforts across Europe and globally to continue to push the limits of our knowledge.\" More information:ASTRONET roadmap, 2022-2035: www.astronet-eu.org/?page_id=521Provided byUniversity College LondonCitation:New report sets course for future of European astronomy (2023, May 10)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-future-european-astronomy.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "An international team of astronomers has used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to observe a luminous dusty star-forming galaxy known as GN20. Results of the observational campaign, published April 26 on the arXiv preprint server, deliver important insights into the stellar structure of this galaxy.          At a redshift of 4.05, GN20 is one of the most luminous dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) known to date. GN20 is located in a protocluster or galaxy overdensity, has an infrared luminosity of some 18.6 solar luminosities, and a star formation rate (SFR) of about 1,860 solar masses per year. The molecular gas distribution in this galaxy shows a clumpy stellar structure with a diameter of approximately 45,600 light years and kinematics consistent with that of a massive rotating disk.Recently, a group of astronomers led by Luis Colina of the Spanish Astrobiology Center in Madrid, Spain, decided to perform mid-infrared observations of GN20, aiming to shed more light on its properties. For this purpose they used JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI).\"GN20 JWST imaging was obtained on November 23\u201324, 2022, using the MIRI imager (MIRIM, Bouchet et al, 2015) in the F560W filter as part of the European Consortium MIRI Guaranteed Time (program ID 1264),\" the researchers explained.The observations found that GN20 has a stellar structure characterized by a luminous (with an absolute magnitude of -22.35) unresolved nucleus and a diffuse extended envelope. This stellar structure is forming new stars at a constant, high rate of about 500 solar masses per year, for a period of 100 million years.The nucleus is less than 2,600 light years in size, carries 9% of the total flux and coincides with the compact, cold dust nuclear emission. The stellar envelope has an effective radius of about 11,740 light years, and its position agrees with that of the carbon monoxide molecular gas, but its centroid is offset by approximately 3,300 light years from the stellar nucleus. This offset may be a result of a recent gravitational encounter or merger.By analyzing the JWST images, the team also identified additional faint stellar clumps that appear to be associated with some of the ultraviolet and carbon monoxide-clumps. Moreover, the astronomers found that the stellar nucleus appears to have the highest concentration of cold dust but not the largest concentration of molecular gas.Summing up the results, the authors of the paper noted that GN20 has all the properties needed to evolve into a massive quiescent galaxy at intermediate redshift.\"It is a large, luminous galaxy at z = 4.05 involved in a short and massive starburst centered in the stellar nucleus and extended over the entire galaxy, out to radii of 4 kpc, and likely induced by the interaction or merger with a member of the proto-cluster,\" the researchers explained.

  "text": "A mysterious trail of stars formed eight thousand million years ago and recently discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope has been a challenge to a number of research groups. Its size is similar to that of the Milky Way, and this very long narrow structure has given rise to several explanations of its origin.          According to a controversial initial hypothesis, this trail of stars could be the result of the passage of a supermassive black hole through a huge cloud of gas. This idea quickly fired the imagination of the astronomical community, because it needs a large set of complex exceptional circumstances. For this reason several scientific teams have continued to explore different and less exotic scenarios that could explain the observations.In a recent study published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, researchers at the Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica de Canarias (IAC) have reached the conclusion that this unusual structure of stars could be interpreted as a galaxy without a bulge seen edge-on. Galaxies of this type, also called thin or flat galaxies, are relatively common.\"The motions, the size, and the quantity of stars fits what has been seen in galaxies within the local universe,\" explains Jorge Sanchez Almeida, an IAC researcher who is the first author of the article. \"It's a relief to have found the solution to this mystery; the new proposed scenario is much simpler. In one sense it is also a pity, because the existence of fleeing black holes is expected, and this could have been the first one to be observed.\"To support the hypothesis of the interpretation in terms of a galaxy, the team compared the mysterious structure with a well-known local galaxy without a bulge, IC5249, which has a similar mass of stars, and found surprising agreement. In the words of Mireia Montes, an IAC researcher who is a co-author of the article, \"When we analyzed the velocities of this distant structure of stars, we realized that they were very similar to those obtained from the rotation of galaxies, so we decided to compare a much closer galaxy, and found that they are extraordinarily similar.\"\"We also looked at the relation between the mass of the assumed galaxy and its maximum velocity of rotation, and discovered that indeed it is a galaxy which behaves like a galaxy,\" states Ignacio Trujillo, an IAC researcher who took part in the study. \"It is an interesting object, because it is quite a large galaxy at a very large distance from Earth, where the majority of the galaxies are smaller,\" he adds.Upcoming observations will allow the study of this object in greater detail.

  "answer_squad": " LISAmax",
  "text": "The first-time detection of Gravitational Waves (GW) by researchers at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) in 2015 triggered a revolution in astronomy. This phenomenon consists of ripples in spacetime caused by the merger of massive objects and was predicted a century prior by Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. In the coming years, this burgeoning field will advance considerably thanks to the introduction of next-generation observatories, like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).          With greater sensitivity, astronomers will be able to trace GW events back to their source and use them to probe the interiors of exotic objects and the laws of physics. As part of their Voyage 2050 planning cycle, the European Space Agency (ESA) is considering mission themes that could be ready by 2050\u2014including GW astronomy. In a recent paper, researchers from the ESA's Mission Analysis Section and the University of Glasgow presented a new concept that would build on LISA\u2014known as LISAmax. As they report, this observatory could potentially improve GW sensitivity by two orders of magnitude.The research was led by theoretical physics Dr. Waldemar Martens, a Mission Analyst at the ESA's European Space Operations Center (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany. He was joined by aerospace engineer and astrophysicist Michael Khan, also a Missions Analyst at the ESOC, and astrophysicist Dr. Jean-Baptiste Bayle, an astronomy and astrophysics Research Fellow with the University of Glasgow. The paper that describes their findings appeared online on the arXiv preprint server recently and is currently being reviewed for publication by the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity.Since they were first detected by LIGO scientists in 2015, researchers with LIGO and other observatories worldwide have refined the types of GW events they can detect. This includes the Virgo Observatory in Italy (near Pisa) and the Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector (KAGRA) in Hida, Japan. These observatories have since partnered with LIGO, forming the Ligo-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration. The efforts of these and other observatories, plus upgrades that have provided increased sensitivity, have multiplied the number of events detected and even traced some back to their sources.As Dr. Martens told Universe Today via email, this pioneering work has been invaluable. But like all forms of astronomy, future progress is dependent in part on having observatories in space:\"Now that there is no doubt that gravitational waves can be measured, astronomers want to use them as an additional source of information where previously only electromagnetic waves were available. Earth-based detectors, like LIGO/Virgo/Kagra are sensitive in the frequency range of tens of Hertz to several kilo-Hertz. This makes them sensitive to sources like black hole mergers of a few tens of solar masses.      \"However, it is known that much larger objects, like super-massive black holes (>10^6 solar masses), exist in the center of galaxies. Mergers of these objects produce gravitational waves far below the sensitive band of Earth-based detectors. To see them, we have to go to space and construct an observatory, like LISA, that has an arm length of 2.5 million km.\"So far, astronomers have detected GW events caused by binary black holes (BBHs) or binary neutron stars (kilonova events), where the co-orbiting bodies eventually merged. It is also theorized that there are many other potential sources, and studying these events could advance our understanding of the Universe. \"Among those are primordial gravitational waves that were produced during processes a fraction of a second after the Big Bang,\" said Dr. Martens. \"We hope that LISA can detect those, but it is not clear yet. That's one of the reasons why detectors with higher sensitivity and/or different frequency bands are considered for Voyage 2050.\"                LISA will observe a passing gravitational wave directly by measuring the tiny changes in distance between freely falling proof masses inside spacecraft with its high precision measurement system. Credit: AEI/MM/exozet             The Voyager 2050 is the latest planning cycle to become part of the agency's Scientific Program, the foundation and the main \"mandatory program\" of the European Space Agency. All member states must contribute, and science goals, proposals, and funding are selected by unanimous decision. These cycles aim to set a long-term funding horizon that allows member states to plan their priorities well in advance and provide the European scientific community with a clear vision of what research areas deserve investment and development.Since the 1980s, the program has been planned with cycles of approximately 20 years, consistent with the amount of time necessary to prepare ambitious space missions. The first planning cycle (Horizon 2000) was established in 1984 and consisted of decisions that led to the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Cluster, Rosetta, XMM-Newton, and Herschel missions from the mid-1990 to the early 21st century. In 2005, a further planning cycle (Cosmic Vision) was launched, including mission proposals that would be realized between 2015 and 2025.This prepared the way for missions like the recently launched JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) and the Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics (ATHENA) X-ray observatory and LISA missions scheduled to launch by the 2030s. The most recent cycle, Voyage 2050, was initiated by the ESA Director of Science Carole Mundell to select scientific properties to follow up on the ATHENA and LISA missions. While these missions will be game-changing, especially in collaboration, Dr. Martens and his colleagues propose ways in which the LISA mission could be enhanced further. As he explained:\"The basic idea of LISAmax is to detect GWs at even lower frequencies than what LISA can do. To be sensitive to these frequencies, one must increase the laser arms of the detector. Larger arms mean larger wavelengths and, thus, lower frequencies. The three LISAmax spacecraft are placed close to the triangular Lagrange points in the sun-Earth system, which gives the detector an arm length of 259 million km. For comparison, LISA's arms have a length of 2.5 million km. This makes LISAmax sensitive to GWs in the micro-Hertz band and opens a new window for GW astronomy.\"                Graphic showing the masses for black holes detected by gravitational-wave observations from LIGO and Virgo (blue) compared to other methods. Credit: LIGO-Virgo/Frank Elavsky/Northwestern             \"Generally speaking, whatever source can be measured by LISA below 1 mHz, can be measured with LISAmax at a signal-to-noise ratio that is about two orders of magnitude better. An example that is discussed in the paper is the inspiral phase of supermassive black hole binaries. While LISA will only be able to see such sources shortly before the final merger event, LISAmax can observe these objects thousands of years before, thus allowing for a much better measurement of certain parameters.\"The scientific community is investigating this concept, which could have drastic implications for the future of GW astronomy. In addition to expanding the range of GW events that could be detected, next-generation GW observatories can trace more events back to their sources. On top of that, astronomers anticipate that GWs will allow them to explore the laws of physics, probe the interiors of extreme objects, and even aid in studying planets and satellites.The proposal put forth by Dr. Martens and his colleagues is one of several GW concepts submitted to the ESA for the Voyage 2050 program. These concepts include a space-based interferometer that would survey the sky for GWs in the millihertz to microhertz (mHz to \u00b5-Hz) frequency range. Another proposes how interferometers sensitive to GWs in the mHz range could be used to learn more about the nature of black holes. Others show how observations in the decihertz (dHz) range could provide the \"missing link\" for GW astronomy, while high-angular astronomy could help trace GWs back to their source.Research into the physics of the early universe, which includes the study of primordial gravitational waves, is also a major theme of the ESA's Voyage 2050 program. By examining the GWs created during the inflationary epoch, scientists would finally be able to probe the physics and microphysics of this early cosmic period.

  "text": "For a new study, a team of physicists recruited roughly 1,000 undergraduate students at the University of Colorado Boulder to help answer one of the most enduring questions about the sun: How does the star's outermost atmosphere, or \"corona,\" get so hot?          The research represents a nearly-unprecedented feat of data analysis: From 2020 to 2022, the small army of mostly first- and second-year students examined the physics of more than 600 real solar flares\u2014gigantic eruptions of energy from the sun's roiling corona.The researchers, including 995 undergraduate and graduate students, published their finding in The Astrophysical Journal. The results suggest that solar flares may not be responsible for superheating the sun's corona, as a popular theory in astrophysics suggests.\"We really wanted to emphasize to these students that they were doing actual scientific research,\" said James Mason, lead author of the study and an astrophysicist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.Study co-author Heather Lewandowski agreed, noting that the study wouldn't be possible without the undergrads who contributed an estimated 56,000 hours of work to the project.\"It was a massive effort from everyone involved,\" said Lewandowski, professor of physics and fellow of JILA, a joint research institute between CU Boulder and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).Campfire physicsThe study zeroes in on a mystery that has left even senior astrophysicists scratching their heads.Telescope observations suggest that the sun's corona sizzles at temperatures of millions of degrees Fahrenheit. The surface of the sun, in contrast, is much cooler, registering only in the thousands of degrees.\"That's like standing right in front of a campfire, and as you back away, it gets a lot hotter,\" Mason said. \"It makes no sense.\"Some scientists suspect that especially tiny flares, or \"nanoflares,\" which are too small for even the most advanced telescopes to spot, may be responsible. If such events exist, they may pop up across the sun on a nearly constant basis. And, the theory goes, they could add up to make the corona toasty. Think of boiling a pot of water using thousands of individual matches.The students' results cast doubt on this theory, Mason said, although he thinks it's too early to say for sure.\"I was hoping our result was going to be different. I still feel like nanoflares are an important driver of coronal heating,\" Mason said. \"But the evidence from our paper suggests the opposite. I'm a scientist. I have to go where the evidence is pointing.\"      Peak pandemic timesThe effort began at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.In spring 2020, CU Boulder, like most universities around the country, had moved its courses entirely online. Lewandowski, however, faced a predicament: She was teaching a class on hands-on research called \"Experimental Physics I\" that fall, and she had nothing for her students to do.\"This was peak pandemic times,\" Lewandowski said. \"It's sometimes hard to remember back to what life was like then. These students were very isolated. They were really stressed.\"Mason, who was then a researcher at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at CU Boulder, offered an idea.The scientist had long wanted to dig into the mathematics of solar flares. In particular, he had tried examining a dataset of thousands of flares that occurred between 2011 and 2018 and had been spotted by instruments in space. They included the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series and NASA's Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS), a CubeSat mission designed and built at LASP.The problem: There were just too many flares to examine on his own.That's when Mason and Lewandowski turned to the students for help.Mason explained that you can infer details about the behavior of nanoflares by studying the physics of larger flares, which scientists have observed directly for decades.To do just that, students split into groups of three or four and picked a normal flare they wanted to analyze over the course of the semester. Then, through a series of lengthy calculations, they added up how much heat could each of these events pour into the sun's corona.Their calculations painted a clear picture: The sum of the sun's nanoflares likely wouldn't be powerful enough to heat up its corona to millions of degrees Fahrenheit.Educational experiencesWhat is making the corona so hot isn't clear. A competing theory suggests that waves in the sun's magnetic field carry energy from inside the sun to its atmosphere.But the study's actual findings aren't its only important results. Lewandowski said her students were able to have opportunities that are rare for scientists and engineers so early in their careers\u2014to learn first-hand about the collaborative and often-messy way that scientific research works in the real world.\"We still hear students talking about this course in the halls,\" she said. \"Our students were able to build a community and support each other at a time that was really tough.\" More information:James Paul Mason et al, Coronal Heating as Determined by the Solar Flare Frequency Distribution Obtained by Aggregating Case Studies, The Astrophysical Journal (2023).

  "text": "Indian astronomers have carried out deep optical photometric observations of the Galactic open cluster Bochum 2 using the 1.3m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope (DFOT). Results of the observational campaign, published May 2 on arXiv, deliver important insights into the properties of this cluster.          Open clusters (OCs), formed from the same giant molecular cloud, are groups of stars loosely gravitationally bound to each other. So far, more than 1,000 of them have been discovered in the Milky Way, and scientists are still looking for more, hoping to find a variety of these stellar groupings. Expanding the list of known galactic open clusters and studying them in detail could be crucial for improving our understanding of the formation and evolution of our galaxy.Bochum 2 (or Boc2 for short) is a young OC in the far northern outskirts of a giant star-forming H II region (containing clouds of ionized atomic hydrogen) known as Sh 2\u2212284. Although Bochum 2 has been known for decades, it is a poorly studied cluster, and there are many uncertainties regarding its fundamental parameters, like distance and age estimates, as previous studies were based mainly on shallow optical data.Therefore, in order to better determine the properties of Bochum 2, a team of astronomers led by Harmeen Kaur of the Kumaun University in Nainital, India, has employed DFOT to conduct deeper photometry of this cluster. Their study was complemented by data from the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3).\"We have performed deep (V\u223c21.3 mag) and widefield (FOV \u223c 18.5 \u00d7 18.5 arcmin2) multiband (UBV Ic) photometric observations around the Boc2 cluster,\" the researchers wrote in the paper.The observations found that Bochum 2 has a radius of 3.6 light years, while its tidal radius is about 6.4\u20138.2 times greater. This suggests that most of the stars in this cluster are the remnants of an older population of stars formed via an earlier epoch of star formation.According to the study, Bochum 2 has a reddening at a level of some 0.8 mag and is located approximately 12,400 light years away from the Earth. Moreover, the collected data allowed the astronomers to identify 24 stars as most probable cluster members and to calculate the age of the most massive stars in Bochum 2, which turned out to be about 5 million years.When it comes to the mass function slope in the cluster region, it was found to be -2.42 in the mass range between 0.72 and 2.8 solar masses. This result indicates the presence of an excess number of low-mass stars in Bochum 2.The study also found that Bochum 2 shows the effect of mass segregation as the cluster's dynamical age, estimated to be 8\u201314 million years, is greater than the age of massive stars. This finding seems to confirm that the massive stars have formed in the inner region of the cluster, in a recent epoch of star formation.

  "text": "Space tourism company Virgin Galactic announced Monday that it is resuming flights with a mission this month, its first in nearly two years, and the launch of commercial trips in June.          The Unity 25 mission will take place in late May with four company employees on board, said Virgin Galactic, which was founded by British billionaire Richard Branson, who took part in the firm's last spaceflight in July 2021.\"Unity 25 is the final assessment of the full spaceflight system and astronaut experience before commercial service opens in late June,\" Virgin Galactic said in a statement.Unity 25 will be the company's fifth trip into space, defined as 50 miles (80 kilometers) above sea level.Unlike other companies that use vertical-launch rockets, Virgin Galactic uses a carrier aircraft that takes off from a runway, gains high altitude, and drops a rocket-powered plane that soars into space before gliding back to Earth.The total journey time is 90 minutes, with passengers experiencing a few minutes of weightlessness in the space plane's cabin.Virgin's flights launch from Spaceport America in New Mexico.The crew for the Unity 25 mission will be made up of two men and two women: Beth Moses, who has taken part in two previous Virgin Galactic flights, Jamila Gilbert, Chris Huie and Luke Mays, who spent several years training NASA astronauts.Two pilots are also assigned to the mothership and two to the spaceship.The first commercial flight, Galactic 01, will include passengers from the Italian Air Force.The Virgin Galactic space program has suffered years of delays and a 2014 accident in which a pilot died.Virgin Galactic has sold 800 tickets for future commercial flights\u2014600 between 2005 and 2014 for $200,000 to $250,000 and 200 since then for $450,000 each.Virgin Galactic is in competition in the space tourism business with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, which also offers short suborbital flights and has sent 32 people into space.Blue Origin's New Shepard rockets have been grounded, however, since a September 2022 accident that occurred shortly after liftoff from Texas on an uncrewed flight.Blue Origin said in March that it hoped to resume flights soon.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Virgin to launch commercial spaceflights in June (2023, May 8)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-virgin-commercial-spaceflights-june.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_race": " To introduce a new way to extract water from the moon.",
  "question_squad": " What is the most concentrated area of water on the moon?",
  "answer_squad": " polar regions",
  "text": "No matter where we go in the universe, we're going to need water. Thus far, human missions to Earth orbit and the moon have taken water with them. But while that works for short missions, it isn't practical in the long term. Water is heavy, and it would take far too much fuel to bring sufficient water to sustain long-term bases on the moon or Mars. So we'll have to use the water we can extract locally.          Fortunately, water is a common molecule in the universe. Even the moon has plenty of water to sustain a lunar colony. The only real challenge is how to extract it. As a recent study published in Acta Astronautica shows, that might be as easy as popping things into a microwave oven.Although water is present in tiny quantities all over the moon, it is most concentrated in the polar regions. Pockets of ice are concentrated in the shadowed regions of the poles. The consistency of these ice pockets is similar to snow mixed in with what is mostly dusty sand particles. Imagine trying to extract drinkable water from such material. If you tried to heat it on your stove, it would be so dry that it wouldn't heat evenly. And even if you were successful in melting the ice, you'd end up with a damp sludge.Previous studies using simulated lunar material have shown that while traditional conductive heating can extract water, it isn't particularly effective. So it takes a lot of power to do, making it difficult to scale up enough to sustain a colony. So in this study, the team looked at using microwaves to extract water.                The fraction of water extracted by microwaves. Credit: Cole, et al             If you've ever reheated something in a microwave oven, you know that a common problem is that it can sometimes be hit or miss. Not only can you get hot regions and icy regions side-by-side, like a poorly cooked hot pocket, they can also heat things in such a way that they are slightly damp. That's because water molecules are strongly excited by microwaves and your oven can cause them to shift in a material, usually toward the surface. So we have long-known microwave cooking can extract water from material. The team wanted to know if it could do it with lunar material effectively.The team focused on two simulated lunar materials. One simulated the lunar highlands (LHS-1) and one simulated the lunar mare region (LMS-1). They then looked at how efficiently water could be extracted under different percentages of ice content. What they found was that using a special microwave oven of just 250 Watts, they could extract about 55% to 67% of the water within about half an hour. That is practical enough to extract plenty of water from the polar regions, and the microwave technology they used would be easy to build and maintain on the moon. Interestingly, the method is less effective when you get to materials with higher water content, where traditional conductive heating is more effective. More information:James D.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the satellite that helped scientists study the gas that surrounds galaxies?",
  "answer_squad": " Suzaku",
  "text": "Astronomers have revealed new evidence about the properties of the giant bubbles of high-energy gas that extend far above and below the Milky Way galaxy's center.          In a study recently published in Nature Astronomy, a team led by scientists at The Ohio State University was able to show that the shells of these structures\u2014dubbed \"eRosita bubbles\" after being found by the eRosita X-ray telescope\u2014are more complex than previously thought.Although they bear a striking similarity in shape to Fermi bubbles, eRosita bubbles are larger and more energetic than their counterparts. Known together as the \"galactic bubbles\" due to their size and location, they provide an exciting opportunity to study star formation history as well as reveal new clues about how the Milky Way came to be, said Anjali Gupta, lead author of the study and a former postdoctoral researcher at Ohio State who is now a professor of astronomy at Columbus State Community College.These bubbles exist in the gas that surrounds galaxies, an area which is called the circumgalactic medium.\"Our goal was really to learn more about the circumgalactic medium, a place very important in understanding how our galaxy formed and evolved,\" Gupta said. \"A lot of the regions that we were studying happened to be in the region of the bubbles, so we wanted to see how different the bubbles are when compared to the regions which are away from the bubble.\"Previous studies had assumed that these bubbles were heated by the shock of gas as it blows outward from the galaxy, but this paper's main findings suggest the temperature of the gas within the bubbles isn't significantly different from the area outside of it.\"We were surprised to find that the temperature of the bubble region and out of the bubble region were the same,\" said Gupta. Additionally, the study demonstrates that these bubbles are so bright because they're filled with extremely dense gas, not because they are at hotter temperatures than the surrounding environment.Gupta and Smita Mathur, co-author of the study and a professor of astronomy at Ohio State, did their analysis using observations made by the Suzaku satellite, a collaborative mission between NASA and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency.By analyzing 230 archival observations made between 2005 and 2014, researchers were able to characterize the diffuse emission\u2014the electromagnetic radiation from very low density gas\u2014of the galactic bubbles, as well as the other hot gases that surround them.Although the origin of these bubbles has been debated in scientific literature, this study is the first that begins to settle it, said Mathur. As the team found an abundance of non-solar neon-oxygen and magnesium-oxygen ratios in the shells, their results strongly suggest that galactic bubbles were originally formed by nuclear star-forming activity, or the injection of energy by massive stars and other kinds of astrophysical phenomena, rather than through the activities of a supermassive black hole.\"Our data supports the theory that these bubbles are most likely formed due to intense star formation activity at the galactic center, as opposed to black hole activity occurring at the galactic center,\" Mathur said. To further investigate the implications their discovery may have for other aspects of astronomy, the team hopes to use new data from other upcoming space missions to continue characterizing the properties of these bubbles, as well as work on novel ways to analyze the data they already have.\"Scientists really do need to understand the formation of the bubble structure, so by using different techniques to better our models, we'll be able to better constrain the temperature and the emission measures that we are looking for,\" said Gupta.Other co-authors were Joshua Kingsbury and Sanskriti Das of Ohio State and Yair Krongold of the National Autonomous University of Mexico.

  "answer_squad": " NISP",
  "text": "The European Space Agency's (ESA) Euclid satellite completed the first part of its long journey into space on May 1, 2023, when it arrived in Florida on a boat from Italy. It is scheduled to lift off on a Falcon 9 rocket, built by SpaceX, from Cape Canaveral in early July.          Euclid is designed to provide us with a better understanding of the \"mysterious\" components of our universe, known as dark matter and dark energy.Unlike the normal matter we experience here on Earth, dark matter neither reflects nor emits light. It binds galaxies together and is thought to make up about 80% of all the mass in the universe. We've known about it for a century, but its true nature remains an enigma.Dark energy is similarly puzzling. Astronomers have shown that the expansion of the universe over the last five billion years has been accelerating faster than expected. Many believe this acceleration is driven by an unseen force, which has been dubbed dark energy. This makes up about 70% of the energy in the universe.Euclid will map this \"dark universe,\" using a suite of scientific instruments to shed light on different aspects of dark energy and dark matter.A light in the darkAfter launch, Euclid will undertake a month-long journey to a region in space called the second Earth-Sun Lagrangian point, which is five times further from us than the Moon. It's where the gravitational pull of the Sun and the Earth balance out and provides a stable vantage point for Euclid to observe the universe. Euclid will join the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at this point and will be the perfect companion to that amazing space observatory.My involvement in Euclid began in 2007 when I was invited by ESA to participate in an independent concept advisory team to assess two competing mission proposals called SPACE and DUNE.Both used different techniques, and therefore different instruments, to study the dark universe, and ESA was struggling to decide between them. Both were compelling concepts and our team decided that both had merit, especially to provide a vital cross-check between them. Euclid was thus born from the best of both concepts.Euclid is designed to study the whole universe so needs instruments with wide fields of view. The wider the field of view of the imaging instrument, the more of the universe it can observe. To do this, Euclid uses a relatively small telescope compared to JWST. In size, Euclid is roughly the size of a truck compared to the aircraft-sized JWST. But Euclid also carries some of the biggest digital cameras deployed in space with fields of view hundreds of times greater than JWST's.      Shapes and colorsThe Euclid VIS (or visible) instrument, built mostly in the UK, is designed to measure the positions and shapes of as many galaxies as possible to look for subtle correlations in this data caused by the gravitational lensing of the light, as it travels to us through the intervening dark matter. This gravitational lensing effect is weak, only one part in a hundred thousand for most galaxies, thus requiring lots of galaxies to see the effect in high definition. Thus VIS will produce Hubble telescope-like image quality over a third of the night sky.VIS, however, can't measure the colors of objects. This is needed to measure their distance through the redshift effect, where light from those objects is shifted to longer, or redder, wavelengths in a way that relates to their distance from us. Some of this data will need to come from existing and planned ground-based observatories, but Euclid also carries the NISP (Near-Infra Spectrometer and Photometer) instrument which is specifically designed to measure the infrared colors and spectra, and therefore redshifts, for the most distant galaxies that Euclid will see.To measure dark energy, NISP will exploit a relative new technique called Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) that provides an accurate measurement of the expansion history of the universe over its last 10 billion years. That history is vital for testing possible models of dark energy including suggested modifications to Einstien's Theory of General Relativity.Treasure troveSuch an experiment takes an army of scientists and not everyone is solely working on dark matter and dark energy. Like JWST, Euclid will be a treasure-trove of new discoveries in many areas of astronomy. The Euclid consortium needs hundreds of people to help develop the sophisticated software needed to merge the space data with the ground-based data, and extract, to high accuracy, the shapes and colors of billions of galaxies.This software has also been checked and verified using some of the largest simulations of the universe that have ever been constructed. After arriving at L2, Euclid will undergo several months of testing, validation and calibration to ensure the instruments and telescope are working as expected. We are all familiar with such nervous waiting after the recent JWST launch.Once ready, Euclid will embark on a five-year survey of 15,000 square degrees of the sky with about 2,000 scientists from across the world collecting results along the way. However, the true power of Euclid will only be realized once we have all this data together and analyzed carefully. That could take another five years, taking us well into next decade before we have our final dark answers. The SpaceX launch therefore only feels like the half-way point in the Euclid story.I will travel to Florida this summer to see the launch of Euclid. I will be joined by hundreds of my colleagues who have dedicated their careers to building this amazing telescope and experiment. Seeing the project come together in this way makes me proud to call myself a \"Euclidian.\" Provided byThe Conversation  This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

  "answer_squad": " Fomalhaut",
  "text": "Astronomers used NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to image the warm dust around a nearby young star, Fomalhaut, in order to study the first asteroid belt ever seen outside of our solar system in infrared light. But to their surprise, the dusty structures are much more complex than the asteroid and Kuiper dust belts of our solar system. Overall, there are three nested belts extending out to 14 billion miles (23 billion kilometers) from the star; that's 150 times the distance of Earth from the Sun. The scale of the outermost belt is roughly twice the scale of our solar system's Kuiper Belt of small bodies and cold dust beyond Neptune. The inner belts\u2014which had never been seen before\u2014were revealed by Webb for the first time.          The belts encircle the young hot star, which can be seen with the naked eye as the brightest star in the southern constellation Piscis Austrinus. The dusty belts are the debris from collisions of larger bodies, analogous to asteroids and comets, and are frequently described as 'debris disks.' \"I would describe Fomalhaut as the archetype of debris disks found elsewhere in our galaxy, because it has components similar to those we have in our own planetary system,\" said Andr\u00e1s G\u00e1sp\u00e1r of the University of Arizona in Tucson and lead author of a new paper describing these results. \"By looking at the patterns in these rings, we can actually start to make a little sketch of what a planetary system ought to look like\u2014If we could actually take a deep enough picture to see the suspected planets.\"The Hubble Space Telescope and Herschel Space Observatory, as well as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), have previously taken sharp images of the outermost belt. However, none of them found any structure interior to it. The inner belts have been resolved for the first time by Webb in infrared light. \"Where Webb really excels is that we're able to physically resolve the thermal glow from dust in those inner regions. So you can see inner belts that we could never see before,\" said Schuyler Wolff, another member of the team at the University of Arizona.Hubble, ALMA, and Webb are tag-teaming to assemble a holistic view of the debris disks around a number of stars. \"With Hubble and ALMA, we were able to image a bunch of Kuiper Belt analogs, and we've learned loads about how outer disks form and evolve,\" said Wolff. \"But we need Webb to allow us to image a dozen or so asteroid belts elsewhere. We can learn just as much about the inner warm regions of these disks as Hubble and ALMA taught us about the colder outer regions.\"These belts most likely are carved by the gravitational forces produced by unseen planets. Similarly, inside our solar system Jupiter corrals the asteroid belt, the inner edge of the Kuiper Belt is sculpted by Neptune, and the outer edge could be shepherded by as-yet-unseen bodies beyond it. As Webb images more systems, we will learn about the configurations of their planets.                This image of the dusty debris disk surrounding the young star Fomalhaut is from Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). It reveals three nested belts extending out to 14 billion miles (23 billion kilometers) from the star. The inner belts \u2013 which had never been seen before \u2013 were revealed by Webb for the first time. Labels at left indicate the individual features. At right, a great dust cloud is highlighted and pullouts show it in two infrared wavelengths: 23 and 25.5 microns. Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, A. G\u00e1sp\u00e1r (University of Arizona). Image processing: A. Pagan (STScI)             Fomalhaut's dust ring was discovered in 1983 in observations made by NASA's Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). The existence of the ring has also been inferred from previous and longer-wavelength observations using submillimeter telescopes on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, and Caltech's Submillimeter Observatory.\"The belts around Fomalhaut are kind of a mystery novel: Where are the planets?\" said George Rieke, another team member and U.S. science lead for Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), which made these observations. \"I think it's not a very big leap to say there's probably a really interesting planetary system around the star.\"\"We definitely didn't expect the more complex structure with the second intermediate belt and then the broader asteroid belt,\" added Wolff. \"That structure is very exciting because any time an astronomer sees a gap and rings in a disk, they say, 'There could be an embedded planet shaping the rings!'\"Webb also imaged what G\u00e1sp\u00e1r dubs \"the great dust cloud,\" which may be evidence for a collision occurring in the outer ring between two protoplanetary bodies. This is a different feature from a suspected planet first seen inside the outer ring by Hubble in 2008. Subsequent Hubble observations showed that by 2014 the object had vanished. A plausible interpretation is that this newly discovered feature, like the earlier one, is an expanding cloud of very fine dust particles from two icy bodies that smashed into each other.The idea of a protoplanetary disk around a star goes back to the late 1700s when astronomers Immanuel Kant and Pierre-Simon Laplace independently developed the theory that the Sun and planets formed from a rotating gas cloud that collapsed and flattened due to gravity. Debris disks develop later, following the formation of planets and dispersal of the primordial gas in the systems. They show that small bodies like asteroids are colliding catastrophically and pulverizing their surfaces into huge clouds of dust and other debris. Observations of their dust provide unique clues to the structure of an exoplanetary system, reaching down to earth-sized planets and even asteroids, which are much too small to see individually.The team's results are being published in the journal Nature Astronomy.

An AGN is an extremely bright region at the heart of a galaxy where a supermassive black hole exists.

  "text": "The jellyfish galaxy JO175 appears to hang suspended in this image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. This galaxy lies over 650 million light-years from Earth in the appropriately named constellation Telescopium and was captured in crystal-clear detail by Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3. A handful of more distant galaxies are lurking throughout the scene, and a bright four-pointed star lies to the lower right side.       Jellyfish galaxies get their unusual name from the tendrils of star-forming gas and dust that trail behind them, just like the tentacles of a jellyfish. These bright tendrils contain clumps of star formation and give jellyfish galaxies a particularly striking appearance. Unlike their ocean-dwelling namesakes, jellyfish galaxies make their homes in galaxy clusters, and the pressure of the tenuous superheated plasma that permeates these galaxy clusters is what draws out the jellyfish galaxies' distinctive tendrils.Hubble recently completed a deep dive into jellyfish clusters, specifically the star-forming clumps of gas and dust that stud their tendrils. By studying the origins and fate of the stars in these clumps, astronomers hoped to better understand the processes underpinning star formation elsewhere in the universe. Interestingly, their research suggests that star formation in the disks of galaxies is similar to star formation in the extreme conditions found in the tendrils of jellyfish galaxies.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the ESA wind mission?",
  "answer_squad": " Aeolus",
  "text": "ESA's wind mission, Aeolus, will soon be lowered in orbit leading to its fiery reentry and burn-up through Earth's atmosphere. ESA's efforts to ensure a safe return go well beyond international standards and place the agency in the lead for space safety.          Having exceeded its planned life in orbit, the 1360-kg satellite is running out of fuel. Ensuring that enough fuel remains for a few final maneuvers, ESA's spacecraft operators will bring Aeolus back toward our planet's atmosphere for its inevitable demise.They will aim the mission toward the ocean, further reducing the very small chance that fragments could cause harm should any reach Earth's surface.This is the first assisted reentry of its kind and sets a precedent for a responsible approach to reduce the ever-increasing problem of space debris and uncontrolled reentries.Why is Aeolus coming home?Launched in 2018, Aeolus has outlived its planned three-year life in space by more than 18 months. During its mission, its trailblazing wind-mapping laser, which at one stage was thought a nigh-impossible feat of engineering, has significantly improved weather forecasts worldwide.Aeolus has been hailed as one of the most successful missions ever built and flown by ESA. As an Earth Explorer research mission, it was designed to demonstrate new space technology, but it became one of the highest impact-per-observation weather satellites, and its laser is still performing as well as ever.However, Aeolus' fuel is now almost depleted and orbiting low, at an altitude of just 320 km, means it is already being caught up by Earth's wispy atmosphere.Speeding up Aeolus' return is the sun.Solar flares and coronal mass ejections release matter and radiation, and when this washes past Earth, it increases the density of Earth's atmosphere. Intense solar activity in recent months means that the satellite has been using even more fuel to remain in orbit. For Aeolus, it's been like running against the wind.                What goes up, nearly always comes back down. When it comes to the objects we send to space, atmospheric reentries are actually a fundamental tool in minimising the creation of space debris and ensuring a sustainable future in space. Credit: ESA / UNOOSA             This is why, after five years of spectacular science, ESA's wind mission ended operations on 30 April 2023.Making use of this phase, scientists have put its instrument into a special mode to perform end-of-life activities that will help to prepare the Aeolus-2 follow-on mission, which like a phoenix will emerge from the ashes of its pathfinding predecessor.      Aeolus' final breathsOver the next few months, Aeolus will descend naturally from its current altitude of 320 km to 280 km. At this point, spacecraft operators at ESA's mission control center, ESOC, in Darmstadt, Germany, will gradually lower it to 150 km above Earth's surface. The satellite will burn up as it descends to around 80 km.As populated regions make up a relatively small percentage of Earth's surface, the chance of a re-entry causing any harm is exceptionally low.The final date depends on how solar activity speeds up the process, but Aeolus is expected to be no more before the end of August.Aeolus engineers and industry partners have carefully worked out how to best position Aeolus in Earth's atmosphere to target open ocean waters upon reentry, hugely reducing the amount of land over which pieces fragments could fall.ESA's Aeolus Mission Manager, Tommaso Parrinello, said, \"The exact details on the reentry approach and series of maneuvers and operations, as well as a more detailed timeline will be made public in mid-June.\"For now, we can anticipate that we are targeting the best ocean corridor to reenter.\"With the assisted reentry of Aeolus, ESA is clearing the way for future missions to continue taking the pulse of our planet. They can only do this if Earth's orbits aren't filled with dangerous space debris, and safety is at the forefront of end-of-life activities.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the galaxy that is located 23 million light years away?",
  "answer_squad": " Arp 269",
  "text": "Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), Chinese astronomers have observed a pair of galaxies known as Arp 269. They detected extended tidal tails emerging from this system. The finding was reported in a paper published April 28 on the arXiv pre-print repository. The article has been accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.          Tidal tails are thin, elongated regions of stars and interstellar gas extending into space. They are formed as a result of gravitational interactions between galaxies and star clusters. The observations show that some interacting objects have two distinct tails, while other systems have only one tail.Located some 23 million light years away, Arp 269 (also known as NGC 4490/85) is a low-mass merging galaxy pair consisting of a smaller irregular galaxy NGC 4485 and a larger barred spiral galaxy NGC 4490. Previous observation of this system found that it is embedded in a very extended, low-density envelope of neutral hydrogen (HI). This envelope is elongated and extended for a total length of about 290,000 light years, and it is approximately perpendicular to the NGC 4490 disk.Recently, a team of astronomers led by Yao Liu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have investigated Arp 269 with FAST, finding more tidal features in this galaxy pair.\"With FAST's superior sensitivity, we discover much more diffuse HI structures in the interacting galaxy pair NGC 4490/85,\" the researchers wrote in the paper.FAST observations found that the tidal tails in Arp 269 are much longer than that seen during previous observations. They extend in both the south and north directions, reaching together a size of about 325,000 light years. The astronomers noted that it is not surprising to see such two long tails in Arp 269 as such structures are one of the most common features seen in closely interacting pairs.Trying to explain the origin of the detected tidal tails, the researchers underlined that the velocity structure of the northern tails matches that of NGC 4485. Therefore, it is very likely that the tails are the debris torn out from the NGC 4485 disk due to interaction with the NGC 4490 galaxy.Furthermore, the study detected a collimated gas component pointing at a nearby dwarf galaxy known as KK 149, located about 160,000\u2013200,000 light years away from NGC 4490. This suggests that KK 149 might also be interacting with Arp 269.According to the authors of the paper, FAST observations also allowed them to identify several tidal features in the gas envelope of Arp 269, which is connected with a starburst low-metallicity dwarf galaxy designated MAPS 1231+42. The results indicate that MAPS 1231+42 is clearly associated with the tidal debris of the interacting pair NGC 4490/85.

  "text": "In our solar system, the planetary orbits all have a similar orientation. Their orbital planes vary by a few degrees, but roughly the planets all orbit in the same direction. This invariable plane as it's known also has an orientation within a few degrees of the sun's rotational plane. Most planetary systems have a similar arrangement, where planetary orbits and stellar rotation are roughly aligned, but a few exoplanets defy this trend, and we aren't entirely sure why.          Common orientation within a planetary system makes sense given how planetary systems form. The protostellar cloud out of which a star and its planets form usually has some inherent rotational momentum. As a star begins to coalesce, a protoplanetary disk forms around the star. Since the planets form within this disk, they all end up with similar orbits. Things can be more complicated with binary or multiple-star systems, but you'd expect single-star planetary systems to have an invariable plane similar to ours. However, this isn't true for a planetary system known as WASP-131, as a recent study shows.WASP-131 is known to have at least one planet, 131b. It's a hot gas planet with a mass a bit less than Saturn that orbits 131 every five days. Earlier studies of 131b found the planet unusual because of how thick its atmosphere is. Although its mass is only a quarter that of Jupiter, its diameter is 20% larger than Jupiter's. 131b has such a low density for a gas planet that it's known as a super-puff planet.The planet was discovered via the transit method, which means it passes in front of its star from our point of view. It's an effective way to find exoplanets, but it can also be used to verify the rotational motion of the star. Because of stellar rotation, light coming from the region of the star rotating toward us is slightly blueshifted, and light from the region rotating away from us is slightly redshifted.This means that spectral lines from the star are blurred a bit. The effect is known as Doppler broadening. As the planet passes in front of the star, it blocks a part of the blueshifted and redshifted regions in turn. This causes the spectral lines of the star to shift a bit. This Rossiter\u2013McLaughlin effect as it's known allows astronomers to measure the orientation of stellar rotation.                An illustration of the Rossiter\u2013McLaughlin effect. Credit: Wikipedia user Autiwa             When the team analyzed the rotation of WASP-131, they found it wasn't similar to that of its planet. The orbit of 131b is tilted about 160 degrees from the rotational plane of the star, meaning that it is in a high, almost polar retrograde orbit. Of course, this raises the question of just how the planet could have gotten such an odd orbit.One idea is a process known as the Kozai effect. Dynamical interactions between the planet, its star, and other planets in the system can cause the orbit to shift away from the invariant planet. We see this in our own solar system with Pluto and Neptune, which has tilted Pluto's orbit over time. The Kozai effect is more pronounced with smaller planets, however, and interaction between planet and star alone isn't enough to explain such an inclined orbit. Another possibility is a magnetic interaction between the planet and the protoplanetary disk early in its formation period.Although the mechanism behind the odd orbit isn't clear, it does follow a pattern seen with many hot gas exoplanets. About a quarter of them have significantly tilted orbits. It seems that these planets sometimes get way out of line.The study is published on the arXiv preprint server. More information:L.

The new storm trackers, sent into orbit on a rocket built by US company Rocket Lab, can fly over hurricanes (or typhoons in the Pacific) every hour, compared to every six hours with current satellites.Researchers will be able to see storms evolve on an hourly basis, said NASA scientist Will McCarty at a press conference for the first launch of the TROPICS mission.\"We still need the large satellites,\" he added. \"What we get from this is the ability to add more information to the flagship satellites that we already have.\"A second Rocket Lab-built vessel is due to launch in about two weeks carrying two more satellites to complete a small constellation of four storm-tracking satellites.The information gathered on rainfall, temperature and humidity could help scientists determine where a hurricane will make landfall and how intense it will be, helping people living in coastal areas be better prepared for possible evacuations.\"Many operational organizations like the National Hurricane Center and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and many others are ready to receive tropical imagery to help inform their forecasters,\" said Ben Kim, a program executive at NASA.In the long term, a better understanding of the formation and evolution of these storms could help improve climate models.The constellation was originally intended to have six satellites, not four, but the first two were lost when a US Astra rocket malfunctioned shortly after lift-off last year.Hurricanes, or typhoons, are becoming more powerful as the ocean surface warms, scientists say.Hurricane Ian, which devastated Florida in 2022, killed dozens of people and caused more than $100 billion in damage, making it by far the world's most expensive weather disaster of the year.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:NASA launches two small satellites to track hurricanes (2023, May 8)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-nasa-small-satellites-track-hurricanes.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_squad": " swallowed",
  "text": "For the first time, scientists have caught a star in the act of swallowing a planet\u2014not just a nibble or bite, but one big gulp.          Astronomers on Wednesday reported their observations of what appeared to be a gas giant around the size of Jupiter or bigger being eaten by its star. The sun-like star had been puffing up with old age for eons and finally got so big that it engulfed the close-orbiting planet.It's a gloomy preview of what will happen to Earth when our sun morphs into a red giant and gobbles the four inner planets.\"If it's any consolation, this will happen in about 5 billion years,\" said co-author Morgan MacLeod of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.This galactic feast happened between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago near the Aquila constellation when the star was around 10 billion years old. As the planet went down the stellar hatch, there was a swift hot outburst of light, followed by a long-lasting stream of dust shining brightly in cold infrared energy, the researchers said.While there had been previous signs of other stars nibbling at planets and their digestive aftermath, this was the first time the swallow itself was observed, according to the study appearing in the journal Nature.Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Kishalay De spotted the luminous outburst in 2020 while reviewing sky scans taken by the California Institute of Technology's Palomar Observatory. It took additional observations and data-crunching to unravel the mystery: Instead of a star gobbling up its companion star, this one had devoured its planet.Given a star's lifetime of billions of years, the swallow itself was quite brief\u2014occurring in essentially one fell swoop, said Caltech's Mansi Kasliwal, who was part of the study.The findings are \"very plausible,\" said Carole Haswell, an astrophysicist at Britain's Open University, who had no role in the research. Haswell led a team in 2010 that used the Hubble Space Telescope to identify the star WASP-12 in the process of eating its planet.\"This is a different sort of eating. This star gobbled a whole planet in one gulp,\" Haswell said in an email. \"In contrast, WASP-12 b and the other hot Jupiters we have previously studied are being delicately licked and nibbled.\"Astronomers don't know if more planets are circling this star at a safer distance. If so, De said they may have thousands of years before becoming the star's second or third course.Now that they know what to look for, the researchers will be on the lookout for more cosmic gulps. They suspect thousands of planets around other stars will suffer the same fate as this one did and, eventually, so will our solar system.\"All that we see around us, all the stuff that we've built around us, this will all be gone in a flash,\" De said.

The four-hour eclipse got underway late Friday or early Saturday, depending on the location, as the moon slipped into the fringes of Earth's shadow.In what's known as a penumbral lunar eclipse, the full moon passed within the outer part of Earth's shadow, causing the moon to dim only slightly. Such an eclipse isn't as dramatic as a partial lunar eclipse or a total lunar eclipse when the moon, Earth and sun are perfectly aligned.The eclipse was visible from beginning to end, weather permitting, as far west as Saudi Arabia and Africa's western coast, as far east as Japan and New Zealand's South Island, and from the South Pole to Siberia. Almost all of Europe also got in on some of the action.The Virtual Telescope Project showed a livestream of the moon rising over the countryside in Tuscany, Italy.\"Even subtle astronomical events like this one make me excited and happy to share them,\" astrophysicist Gianluca Masi, the project's founder, said in an email.The next lunar eclipse in October will put on a better display.

  "answer_squad": " $93,400 per kg",
  "text": "As humans contemplate life on other planets, we are immediately confronted with two choices. One is a journey to another solar system that would take tens of thousands of years (with current technology), requiring around 2,000 generations to live out their existence in the cramped confines of a spacecraft while adhering to a strict population control scheme. The other choice is Mars.          Mars has several advantages, not the least of which is proximity, eliminating the need to push people out of airlocks when the spacecraft is at capacity. It would also allow an advance team to set up basic infrastructure and to be the most efficient\u2014the team should all be female.Researchers from the Space Medicine Team, European Space Agency in Germany have conducted a study published in Scientific Reports that found female astronauts have lower water requirements for hydration, total energy expenditure, oxygen (O2) consumption, carbon dioxide (CO2) and metabolic heat production during space exploration missions compared to their male counterparts.In the study, \"Effects of body size and countermeasure exercise on estimates of life support resources during all-female crewed exploration missions,\" the team utilized an approach developed to estimate the effects of body \"size\" on life support requirements in male astronauts. For all parameters at all statures, estimates for females were lower than for comparable male astronauts.When considering the limited space, energy, weight, and life support systems packed into a spacecraft on a long mission, the study finds that the female form is the most efficient body type for space exploration.According to NASA, the cost of getting payloads to the International Space Station (ISS) is $93,400 per kg. The study found that on a 1080-day mission, a four-member all-female crew would require 1695 kg less food weight. With some simple arithmetic, the mission could save over $158 million and free up 2.3 m3 of space (food packaging), the equivalent of approximately 4% of the habitable volume (60 m3) of a \"Gateway\" HALO module in NASA's proposed lunar orbit space station. Both factors would be highly significant operationally, but there is more.Compared to a previous study of theoretical male astronauts, the effect of body size on total energy expenditure was markedly less in females, with relative differences ranging from 5% to 29% lower. Compared at the 50th percentile stature for US females (1.6m), the reductions were even more significant at 11% to 41%. This translates into reduced use of oxygen, production of CO2, metabolic heat, and water use.      When exposed to the prolonged microgravity of space, bad things happen to astronaut bodies. Physiological changes induce muscle atrophy, bone loss, and reduced aerobic and sensorimotor capacity, potentially affecting crewmember health and ability to perform mission tasks.Exercise in space is called \"countermeasure exercise\" as it is designed to counter the physiological effects of being weightless. During these exercises (two 30-min aerobic exercises, six days a week), astronauts have higher rates of O2 consumption, production of CO2, metabolic heat production, and require more water to rehydrate.While body size alone correlates to energy metrics (smaller stature, less energy used), missions requiring countermeasure exercise increase this disparity as larger bodies use more energy, need more oxygen, produce more CO2 and create more heat. Additionally, the study found that females had 29% less water loss through sweating during a single bout of aerobic countermeasure exercise and so required less water to rehydrate.The theoretical differences between female and male astronauts result from lower resting and exercising O2 requirements of female astronauts, who are lighter than male astronauts at equivalent statures and have lower relative VO2max (the rate at which the heart, lungs, and muscles can effectively use oxygen during exercise) values.Aside from resource usage, there are also advantages in functional workspaces, especially when multiple astronauts are working in the same confined area, as often happens on the ISS. Aboard the ISS, the astronauts have just enough room to stand and work shoulder-to-shoulder or back-to-back when necessary. The spaces in the proposed NASA Gateway craft are tighter, creating a less ergonomic environment for multiple crew members to work together. Tighter spaces could operate just as efficiently with a smaller crew.The study data, combined with the move towards smaller diameter habitat space for currently proposed mission modules, suggest that there may be several operational advantages to all-female crews during future human space exploration missions, with the most significant improvement coming from shorter females.

  "text": "An international team of space scientists has found that observation of a gas cloud stream heading into a massive galaxy may offer evidence of gas material recycling. In their paper published in the journal Science, the group describes their observance and analysis of a gas cloud surrounding a dense galaxy cluster 11 billion light years away, and what they learned from their work.          Space scientists have, for many years, predicted that enriched gases surrounding galaxies could be pulled into such galaxies and wind up as material for making new stars. They have also suggested that such gases could have come to exist due to explosion of supernova that escape their galaxy. Thus, those gases, when they are pulled back into a galaxy are being recycled. In this new effort, the research team believes it may have found evidence of such recycling.The researchers analyzed data from the Subaru and Keck II telescopes which were focused on a huge galaxy at redshift 2.3 which is surrounded by a nebula (cloud of gas and dust) called MAMMOTH-1. When the nebula was first discovered in 2017, it was considered to be mysterious. But a new examination suggests that the galaxy is pulling material from the nebula closer, via three distinct gas streams. They found that two of the streams pointed to a single quasar, which they suspect lives in the galaxy.Further study of the streams showed that in addition to hydrogen and helium, they also have a lot of carbon in them, which prior research has shown is created inside of stars. Thus, the carbon in the gas stream must have once existed in a star, but now no longer does\u2014hinting at expulsion due to a supernova. The fact that the gas in which the carbon exists appears to be part of stream heading into the galaxy suggests that it will soon be used to take part in forming new stars.The team conducted kinematic modeling of the galaxy and nebula and it showed the gas streams spiraling into the galaxy, suggesting that they are likely part of a massive recycling process whereby stars blow up and leftover material from the explosions winds up as material used for construction of new stars.

In their study, reported in the journal Nature, the group analyzed data from a wide variety of sources and used it to create models depicting the inner parts of the moon          In 2011, planetary scientists at NASA used seismic data recorded by Apollo astronauts to predict what might lie at the center of the moon. They suggested it was likely that there was a solid inner core with a radius of approximately 240 kilometers. In this new effort, the researchers used a variety of sources to make similar estimates and found evidence that matches closely with the NASA results.To learn more about the moon's core, the research team collected data from several space missions and from several lunar-based ranging experiments. They used that data to create a likely profile for the interior of the moon, including characteristics such as deformations created due to gravitational interactions with the Earth, the moon's distance from Earth and also the moon's density. They then input all of their data into a modeling application. Next, they ran multiple modeling scenarios to see which corresponded most closely with real-world data.The model that fit most closely to observations revealed evidence of active overturn, where denser material is pulled closer to the core over time, forcing lighter material upward. This finding helps explain how many of the elements found in volcanic regions of the moon got there.The other main finding was that the density of the inner core matched closely with that of Earth's, suggesting it is likely made of iron. The models also showed that the inner core has a radius of approximately 258 kilometers and a density of approximately 7,822 kilograms per cubic meter. It also showed the outer core to be a fluid layer covering the inner core with a radius of 362 kilometers.

Shown as a dark elongated area in the center of the image, the town of El Oued lies around an oasis in the northern Sahara, in a region that is otherwise an endless sea of sand.This false-color image has been processed using the mission's near-infrared channel to display vegetation in red, with irrigated vegetation shown in bright red and non-irrigated areas appearing in darker red tones. These vegetated areas stand out clearly in the surrounding gold sand dunes shaped by the wind.Most of the agricultural fields in the image are circular, indicating that central-pivot irrigation systems are being used. A well, drilled in the center of each circle, supplies water to rotating sprinklers that spray water in a circular pattern. Each of the circles is around 100 m in diameter. The main crops here include potatoes, onions and tomatoes.Date palms are also very important for the local economy. They are typically grown using traditional methods inside irregular funnel-shaped fields in the sand. They do not need to be irrigated frequently and can be spotted in dark colors throughout the image, such as around El Oued and to the south of the town of Hassani Abdelkrim, northeast of El Oued.While providing detailed information about Earth's vegetation, Copernicus Sentinel-2 plays a key role in mapping differences in land cover to understand how it is used and to track changes over time, so useful for monitoring desertification.

The group's latest research, published on May 4, 2023, by the journal Nature Communications, shows that seasonal and daily variations in the Earth's magnetic tilt, toward or away from the sun, can trigger changes in large-wavelength space waves.These breaking waves, known as Kelvin-Helmholtz waves, occur at the boundary between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic shield. The waves happen much more frequently around the spring and fall seasons, researchers reported, while wave activity is poor around summer and winter.As plasma or solar wind streams from the sun at speeds up to 1 million miles per hour, it pushes energy, mass and momentum toward the planet's magnetic shield. It also whips up space waves.Fast-moving solar wind can't pass directly through the Earth's magnetic shield, so it thunders along the magnetosphere, propelling Kelvin-Helmholtz waves with massive peaks up to 15,000 kilometers (km) high and 40,000 km long.Astronaut safety and satellite communication\"Through these waves, solar wind plasma particles can propagate into the magnetosphere, leading to variations in radiation belt fluxes of energetic particles\u2014regions of dangerous radiation\u2014that may affect astronaut safety and satellite communications,\" said Dr. Shiva Kavosi, a research associate at Embry-Riddle and first author of the Nature Communications paper. \"On the ground, these events can impact power grids and Global Positioning Systems.\"Describing the properties of space waves and the mechanisms that cause them to intensify is key to understanding and forecasting space weather, Kavosi noted, \"Space weather events represent an increasing threat, yet in many cases, we don't understand exactly what controls it. Any progress we can make in understanding the mechanisms behind space weather disturbances will improve our ability to provide forecasts and warnings.\"In trying to understand the causes of seasonal and diurnal variations of geomagnetic activity, researchers in the field have set forth several different hypotheses. For example, the Russell-McPherron (R-M) effect, first described in 1973, explains why auroras are more frequent and brighter in the spring and fall, based on the interplay of the Earth's dipole tilt and a small magnetic field near the sun's equator.\"We don't have all the answers yet,\" said Dr. Katariina Nykyri, professor of physics and associate director for the Center of Space and Atmospheric Research at Embry-Riddle, \"but our paper shows that the R-M effect is not the only explanation for the seasonal variation of geomagnetic activities. Equinox-driven events, based on the Earth's dipole tilt, and R-M effects could operate simultaneously.\"In the future, Nykyri added, constellations of spacecraft in the solar wind and magnetosphere could more fully explain the complicated, multi-scale physics of space weather phenomena. \"Such a system would allow advanced warnings of space weather to inform the operators of rocket launches and electrical power grids,\" she said.The paper concludes that \"KH waves activity exhibit seasonal and diurnal variations, indicating the critical role of dipole tilt in modulating KHI across the magnetopause as a function of time.\"The research article, \"Seasonal and Diurnal Variations of Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability at Terrestrial Magnetopause,\" was authored by Embry-Riddle researchers Nykyri and Kavosi; C.J. Farrugia and Jimmy Raedar of the University of New Hampshire, Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans and Space; and J.R. Johnson of Andrews University. More information:S.

  "text": "With a single letter seemingly etched in the X-ray glow around it, a giant black hole at the center of a massive elliptical galaxy is making a mark on its surroundings.          This \"H\"-shaped structure is found in a detailed new X-ray map of the multimillion-degree gas around the galaxy Messier 84 (M84).As gas is captured by the gravitational force of the black hole, some of it will fall into the abyss, never to be seen again. Some of the gas, however, avoids this fate and instead gets blasted away from the black hole in the form of jets of particles. These jets can push out cavities, in the hot gas surrounding the black hole.Given the orientation of the jets to Earth and the profile of the hot gas, the cavities in M84 form what appears to resemble the letter \"H.\" The H-shaped structure in the gas is an example of pareidolia, which is when people see familiar shapes or patterns in random data. Pareidolia can occur in all kinds of data from clouds to rocks and astronomical images.Astronomers used NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory to make a map of the hot gas (pink) in and around M84, reaching to within only about 100 light-years away from the black hole in the center of the galaxy. This gas radiates at temperatures in the tens of millions of degrees, making it primarily observable in X-rays.Credit: ChandraThe huge letter \"H\" is about 40,000 light-years tall\u2014about half the width of the Milky Way. The radio image from the National Science Foundation's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) (blue) reveals the jets streaking away from the black hole. Optical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (white) shows M84 and neighboring galaxies. The letter H and the position of the black hole are labeled. An additional graphic shows a close-up of the region marked with a square, and separate labels for the galaxy and the jets in the optical and radio images respectively.Researchers studying M84 with Chandra and the VLA found that the jets may influence the flow of the hot gas towards the black hole even more than the gravitational pull from the black hole. For example, the team estimates matter is falling towards the black hole from the north\u2014along the direction of the jet seen in radio waves\u2014at about 500 times the mass of the Earth every year, a rate that is only a quarter of that from directions where the jet is not pointing, to the east and west. One possibility is that gas is lifted along the direction of the jet by the cavities, slowing the rate at which gas falls onto the black hole.      The authors tested a model called Bondi accretion, where all of the matter within a certain distance from a black hole\u2014effectively inside a sphere\u2014is close enough to be affected by a black hole's gravity and start falling inwards at the same rate from all directions. (The dashed circle in the close-up image is centered on the black hole and shows the approximate distance from the black hole where gas should start falling inwards.) This effect is named after the scientist Hermann Bondi, and \"accretion\" refers to matter falling toward the black hole. The new results show that Bondi accretion is not occurring in M84 because matter is not falling towards the black hole evenly from all directions.

Bambic et al.; Optical: SDSS; Radio: NSF/NRAO/VLA/ESO; Image processing: NASA/CXC/SAO/N.Wolk             M84 is a cousin of Messier 87 (M87), the galaxy containing the first black hole imaged with the global Event Horizon Telescope network, and, like M87, is also a member of the Virgo Cluster. The supermassive black hole in M84, along with those in our galaxy, M87, NGC 3115, and NGC 1600, are the only ones close enough to Earth, or massive enough, for astronomers to see details in Chandra images which are so near the black hole that gas should be falling inwards.Like the black hole in M87, the one in M84 is producing a jet of particles; however, the point source of X-rays from material even closer to the black hole is over ten times fainter for M84. This allows more detailed study of gas falling towards the black hole in M84 that is farther out, preventing the faint X-rays produced by this gas from being overwhelmed by the X-ray glare from the point source.A paper describing these results is set to appear in The Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and a preprint is published on arXiv.

  "answer_squad": " Voyager",
  "text": "Re-analysis of data from NASA's Voyager spacecraft, along with new computer modeling, has led NASA scientists to conclude that four of Uranus' largest moons likely contain an ocean layer between their cores and icy crusts. Their study is the first to detail the evolution of the interior makeup and structure of all five large moons: Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon, and Miranda. The work suggests four of the moons hold oceans that could be dozens of miles deep.          In all, at least 27 moons circle Uranus, with the four largest ranging from Ariel, at 720 miles (1,160 kilometers) across, to Titania, which is 980 miles (1,580 kilometers) across. Scientists have long thought that Titania, given its size, would be most likely to retain internal heat, caused by radioactive decay. The other moons had previously been widely considered too small to retain the heat necessary to keep an internal ocean from freezing, especially because heating created by the gravitational pull of Uranus is only a minor source of heat.The National Academies' 2023 Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey prioritized exploring Uranus. In preparation for such a mission, planetary scientists are focusing on the ice giant to bolster their knowledge about the mysterious Uranus system. Published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, the new work could inform how a future mission might investigate the moons, but the paper also has implications that go beyond Uranus, said lead author Julie Castillo-Rogez of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.\"When it comes to small bodies\u2014dwarf planets and moons\u2014planetary scientists previously have found evidence of oceans in several unlikely places, including the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto, and Saturn's moon Mimas,\" she said. \"So there are mechanisms at play that we don't fully understand. This paper investigates what those could be and how they are relevant to the many bodies in the solar system that could be rich in water but have limited internal heat.\"                A recent NASA Hubble Space Telescope view reveals Uranus surrounded by its four major rings and by 10 of its 17 known satellites. Credit: NASA/JPL/STScI             The study revisited findings from NASA's Voyager 2 flybys of Uranus in the 1980s and from ground-based observations. The authors built computer models infused with additional findings from NASA's Galileo, Cassini, Dawn, and New Horizons (each of which discovered ocean worlds), including insights into the chemistry and the geology of Saturn's moon Enceladus, Pluto and its moon Charon, and Ceres\u2014all icy bodies around the same size as the Uranian moons.What lies above and beneathThe researchers used that modeling to gauge how porous the Uranian moons' surfaces are, finding that they're likely insulated enough to retain the internal heat that would be needed to host an ocean. In addition, they found what could be a potential heat source in the moons' rocky mantles, which release hot liquid, and would help an ocean maintain a warm environment\u2014a scenario that is especially likely for Titania and Oberon, where the oceans may even be warm enough to potentially support habitability.      By investigating the composition of the oceans, scientists can learn about materials that might be found on the moons' icy surfaces as well, depending on whether substances underneath were pushed up from below by geological activity. There is evidence from telescopes that at least one of the moons, Ariel, has material that flowed onto its surface, perhaps from icy volcanoes, relatively recently.In fact, Miranda, the innermost and fifth largest moon, also hosts surface features that appear to be of recent origin, suggesting it may have held enough heat to maintain an ocean at some point. The recent thermal modeling found that Miranda is unlikely to have hosted water for long: It loses heat too quickly and is probably frozen now.But internal heat wouldn't be the only factor contributing to a moon's subsurface ocean. A key finding in the study suggests that chlorides, as well as ammonia, are likely abundant in the oceans of the icy giant's largest moons. Ammonia has been long known to act as antifreeze. In addition, the modeling suggests that salts likely present in the water would be another source of antifreeze, maintaining the bodies' internal oceans.Of course, there still are a lot of questions about the large moons of Uranus, Castillo-Rogez said, adding that there is plenty more work to be done: \"We need to develop new models for different assumptions on the origin of the moons in order to guide planning for future observations.\"Digging into what lies beneath and on the surfaces of these moons will help scientists and engineers choose the best science instruments to survey them. For instance, determining that ammonia and chlorides may be present means that spectrometers, which detect compounds by their reflected light, would need to use a wavelength range that covers both kinds of compounds.Likewise, they can use that knowledge to design instruments that can probe the deep interior for liquid. Searching for electrical currents that contribute to a moon's magnetic field is generally the best way to find a deep ocean, as Galileo mission scientists did at Jupiter's moon Europa. However, the cold water in the interior oceans of moons such as Ariel and Umbriel could make the oceans less able to carry these electrical currents and would present a new kind of challenge for scientists working to figure out what lies beneath.

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the most likely scenario for life on other worlds?",

  "text": "If we ever find life on other worlds, it is unlikely to be a powerful message from space. It's certainly possible that an alien civilization specifically sends us a radio message like a scene out of Contact, but the more likely scenario is that we observe some kind of biological signature in an exoplanet's atmosphere, such as oxygen or chlorophyll. But as a recent study released on the arXiv preprint server shows, that could be more difficult than we thought.       There is reason to be hopeful. We are already able to image some exoplanets directly and have detected molecules such as water in their atmospheres. The planets we've directly observed are all gas giants, though. We can't image Earth-sized planets in a star's habitable zone yet, but there is a trick we can use to study their atmospheres.Most of the planets we've discovered are found by the transit method, where the planet passes in front of a star causing the star's observed brightness to dip slightly. But while the planet is in front of the star, some of the starlight will pass through the planet's atmosphere before reaching us. By observing the star's spectrum during a planetary transit we can measure what light the atmosphere absorbs. From the absorption lines, we can determine the composition of the planet's atmosphere.                The flicker of Trappist-1 reveals exoplanets. Credit: NASA/Kepler/K2             It's a small effect, but is it big enough to be useful to astronomers? That's the question this new study wanted to answer. For current observatories, the answer is clearly no. So the team focused on simulations of telescopes that will go live in the relatively near future. These extremely large telescopes will have mirrors of 10 meters or more, perhaps as large as 50\u2013100 meters. And while these telescopes should be able to detect all kinds of molecules in a planet's atmosphere, the team focused on oxygen. Oxygen is unstable in an atmosphere because it reacts so strongly with other materials. On Earth atmospheric oxygen is replenished by living things. If we detect oxygen in an exoplanet's atmosphere, that's a good indicator that life could be there.                The timeline for observing oxygen in nearby exoplanets. Credit: Hardegree-Ullman, et al             The good news is that these future large telescopes would be able to observe oxygen in an exoplanetary atmosphere. The atmosphere would need to be reasonably transparent and thick, but it's possible. The bad news is that astronomers will have a dickens of a time filtering out the signal from the noise. Even these large telescopes will capture only a few pixels of light from a star, and atmospheric observations can only happen while the planet is transiting. This means that to find the signal within the noise, astronomers will have to observe multiple transits. Possibly hundreds of them.As an example, the team looked at a planetary system known as TRAPPIST-1. It's about 40 light-years away and has 7 planets that are roughly Earth-sized. Four of them orbit within the star's habitable zone. Since TRAPPIST-1 is a red dwarf star, the habitable zone is quite close to the star, and the potentially habitable worlds have orbital periods of between 4 and 12 days. If we assume these planets have atmospheres similar to Earth's, with plenty of free oxygen, it would take thousands of transits to get a positive result. The team looked at a 3-sigma threshold of certainty and found it would take between 16 to 55 years of observations to confirm atmospheric oxygen, and that's using telescopes that still haven't been built.

  "text": "A trio of astrophysicists at Sorbonne Universit\u00e9 has developed a new theory to help describe the stability of the solar system. In their paper published in the journal Physical Review X, Federico Mogavero, Nam Hoang and Jacques Laskar, describe their theory and what it suggests about the nature of the solar system.          For many years, space enthusiasts have wondered about the nature of the stability of the solar system. Hundreds of years ago, after scientists discovered other planets and proved that Earth, along with them, orbited the sun, questions arose about the possibility of the planets undergoing changes to their orbits leading to collisions or disappearing into the sun or outer space.Even Newton was uneasy about his observations\u2014after applying his theories of motion and gravity, he found it likely that the gravitational forces that the planets exert on each other would lead to inevitable changes in their orbits and the deterioration of the solar system. But unwilling to accept his own science, he suggested that the system was reset periodically by God, preventing its demise.Over the ensuing years, space scientists have gone back and forth on the issue, with some suggesting that the solar system will self-destruct over time and others insisting that there must be some force that keeps the planets in their proper path\u2014otherwise, how could it have persisted for so long?Things began to change as computers were applied to the problem, allowing for the creation of models that used past and current parameters to predict the likely future of the solar system. Such models showed that the element of chaos was unavoidable. Now, most planetary scientists agree that the solar system is unstable and that it is slowly tearing itself apart.The newer models also give astronomers a clearer look at the future\u2014they show Mercury going rogue first, for example, either by colliding with Venus or falling into the sun. But there is still one major problem\u2014most of the models show the solar system destabilizing over millions of years but remaining intact for billions of years.In this new effort, the research trio has developed a theory to explain this apparent discrepancy. In short, they suggest that there are hidden structures within the motion of the planets that help to stabilize them. They believe that such structures keep the destabilization in check, slowing planets down and preventing them from straying in any given direction. They further suggest that a sort of fast-chaos manifests itself on the orbit of a given planet, which in turn holds destabilization in check, preventing the planets from wandering. And finally, they suggest this mechanism acts along the position of the orbit of a planet, not on its shape.

I am astounded by everything we have done in the last month,\" she told AFP.Graduates from the course could be headed for the moon, in the scope of the Artemis mission, which hopes to return astronauts to the rock within a decade and to establish a permanent base on Earth's natural satellite.Woman on the moonThe current cohort of astronauts includes the highest number of women to date after a push by the ESA to make space travel less masculine.The agency encouraged more women to apply for the opportunity to go to space. In all, almost a quarter of candidates in 2021 were women, up from 15 percent in the last round in 2008.\"More than just having women in the team, what is important is diverse backgrounds and professions,\" said Adenot.

And that's where you need to stay calm.\"After 13 months of training, only the candidate chosen to go to the ISS will begin a separate two-year program tailored to the mission.Despite the limited space onboard the rocket, the team at the ESA work well together.\"We are like a team of highly trained athletes. The demands of space missions are so high that you can only match them by working together,\" said Adenot.\"When one of us is selected for a mission, whether it is on the International Space Station or the moon, we will all be behind them.\"    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Prep in the pool for Europe's next astronauts (2023, May 4)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-prep-pool-europe-astronauts.html  This document is subject to copyright.

Ivory Coast, which recently hosted a \"NewSpace Africa\" conference organized by the African Union, has announced the creation of a space agency and plans to build the country's first nanosatellite by 2024.In April, Kenya's first working satellite was put into orbit by a SpaceX rocket launched from the United States.The two countries follow African pioneers South Africa, Nigeria, Algeria and Egypt\u2014a trailblazer which owned the first African satellite sent into space in 1998.According to AU space program coordinator Tidiane Ouattara, about 15 African countries have a space agency.The AU in 2018 fostered the African Space Agency, whose headquarters will be in Cairo alongside the Egyptian Space Agency, to promote coordination among AU members.According to a Vienna-based NGO, the Space Generation Advisory Council, African countries have launched 41 satellites since 2016, led by Egypt, South Africa, Algeria and Nigeria.But only nine were designed and made in African states, while the rest were provided by foreign states, which also provided launch capability.Lower cost barrierThe good news is that cost, the great barrier to entering space, is plummeting thanks to cheaper components and miniaturization, which reduces satellite weight.\"Space is no longer expensive, not at all,\" said Ouattara. A nanosatellite with a mass of between one and 10 kilos (2.2 and 22 pounds) can be built by African universities for between $50,000 and $100,000, he said.A top priority for African countries is Earth observation\u2014satellites that monitor cloud cover, rainfall, flooding, drought and so on, said Mamadou Sarr, head of a pan-African group, the Regional African Satellite Communication Organization (RASCOM).Nearly half of Africa's population lives from farming, according to UN figures.The continent also accounts for nearly two-thirds of the world's uncultivated arable land, according to the African Development Bank\u2014a crucial factor in how the planet can feed a human population expected to reach nine billion by 2050.Satellites can also play a security role, monitoring foreign plundering of coastal fisheries and movements of jihadist rebels destabilizing the Sahel and northern Mozambique.$20 billion marketAnother big market is communications.Africa was an early convert to satellite technology, which along with mobile phone networks helped it leapfrog over copper wire networks to move around data.Its billion population are voracious digital consumers, not just for classic entertainment such as TV and radio but also in innovative areas such as mobile phone banking and telemedecine.According to an AU study published in 2019, the African space market will be worth $20 billion next year.But right now, it is the foreign providers who harvest the data bounty\u2014a scenario that some have likened to a rerun of colonial history.\"Africa should not become a place for conquest once more,\" Ivory Coast's minister for higher education and scientific research, Adama Diawara, said at the space conference.Africa's problems in developing commercial use of space are not just about funding, he said.The continent's vibrant entrepreneurial culture is being hampered by \"hazy or absent regulations\", and this creates uncertainty for investors, he said.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Africa eyes potential bounty from space (2023, May 4)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-africa-eyes-potential-bounty-space.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Europe's latest weather satellite, the Meteosat Third Generation Imager, has just delivered its first view of Earth\u2014revealing conditions over Europe, Africa and the Atlantic in remarkable detail.          Launched on an Ariane 5 rocket on 13 December 2022, the Meteosat Third Generation Imager-1 (MTG-I1) is the first of a new generation of satellites set to revolutionize weather forecasting in Europe. ESA and Eumetsat are proud to jointly release the new image from the next generation.The image, which was captured by the satellite's Flexible Combined Imager on 18 March 2023, shows much of Northern and Western Europe and Scandinavia blanketed in clouds, with relatively clear skies over Italy and the Western Balkans.ESA's Director of Earth Observation Programs, Simonetta Cheli, said, \"This image is a great example of what European cooperation in space can achieve. The level of detail MTG-I1's image reveals, unachievable over Europe and Africa from a geostationary orbit until now, will give us a greater understanding of our planet and the weather systems that shape it.\"This image represents not just what can be achieved through European expertise but our determination to ensure the benefits of new technology are felt by communities in Europe and beyond.\"Instruments onboard the third generation of Meteosat meteorological satellites produce imagery with a much higher resolution, and more frequently, than those on the Meteosat Second Generation satellites.Details such as cloud vortices over the Canary Islands, snow cover on the Alps and sediment in the water along the coast of Italy are visible in the image. These details are not as clearly visible, or not visible at all, in images from the instruments on the current second-generation spacecraft.Credit: European Space AgencyThe new image also reveals a greater level of detail of cloud structures at high latitudes. This will enable weather forecasts to monitor the evolution of rapidly developing severe weather more accurately in that region.Phil Evans, Director General at Eumetsat, added, \"This remarkable image gives us great confidence in our expectation that the MTG system will herald a new era in the forecasting of severe weather events.\"It might sound odd to be so excited about a cloudy day in most of Europe. But the level of detail seen for the clouds in this image is extraordinarily important to weather forecasters. That additional detail from the higher resolution imagery, coupled with the fact that images will be produced more frequently, means forecasters will be able to more accurately and rapidly detect and predict severe weather events.\"\"The high-resolution and frequent repeat cycle of the Flexible Combined Imager will greatly help the World Meteorological Organization community to improve forecasts of severe weather, long-term climate monitoring, marine applications, agricultural meteorology, and will make an important contribution to the Early Warnings For All Initiative, in particular on the African continent,\" added Natalia Donoho, Head of the World Meteorological Organization Space Systems and Utilization Division, WMO.MTG-I1 is currently undergoing a 12-month commissioning phase, in which its instruments, the Flexible Combined Imager and the Lightning Imager, are switched on and the data they produce are calibrated. Data from the satellite will then be disseminated to meteorological services in Europe and beyond at the end of 2023, for operational use in weather forecasts.The ground segment infrastructure required to routinely process images was used to produce this first image, as a preview of things to come this year. Images of the full Earth disk will be produced every 10 minutes when the system is fully operational.The MTG satellites are built by a large consortium of European industries, led by Thales Alenia Space in cooperation with OHB. The innovative Lightning Imager was developed by Leonardo in Italy, while Telespazio provides Eumetsat with launch and in-orbit services.                To meet more than the 20-year operational life of the mission, the full Meteosat Third Generation system comprises six satellites: four Imaging (MTG-I) satellites and two Sounding (MTG-S) satellites. When fully deployed, the system will include two MTG-I satellites operating in tandem\u2014one scanning Europe and Africa every 10 minutes and the other only Europe but every 2.5 minutes\u2014and one MTG-S satellite to provide fast local-area coverage over selected parts of Earth. The image shows the three satellites with the two MTG-I satellites (foreground and left) and one MTG-S satellite (on the right). The combination of MTG\u2019s innovative instruments along with their increased resolution and sensitivity is set to take weather forecasting to the next level, particularly in the challenging task of early detection and prediction of rapidly evolving and potentially dangerous weather events such as severe thunderstorms. The MTG-I satellites carry a Flexible Combined Imager and a Lightning Imager. The MTG-S satellites carry an Infrared Sounder and the Copernicus Sentinel-4 instrument. MTG is a cooperation between ESA and Eumetsat. ESA is responsible for the definition and implementation of the MTG satellites and procurement of recurrent hardware, while Eumetsat is in charge of operating the spacecraft throughout its lifetime. The MTG satellites will replace the current Meteosat Second Generation operational system. Credit: ESA/Mlabspace, CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO             A new era of satellite meteorologyMTG-I1 is the first of six satellites that form the full MTG system, which will provide critical data for short-term and early detection of potential extreme weather events over the next 20 years. In full operations, the mission will comprise two MTG-I satellites and one MTG Sounding (MTG-S) satellite working in tandem.The MTG-S sounding satellites\u2014a first for Meteosat\u2014will carry an Infrared Sounder and an Ultraviolet Visible Near-Infrared spectrometer. By monitoring atmospheric instability in three dimensions throughout the clouds, the sounder will offer a major step forward for early warnings of severe thunderstorms and is expected to provide unique information from geostationary orbit on ozone, carbon monoxide and volcanic ash composition within the atmosphere.Currently the revolutionary Infrared Sounding instrument is in its final performance characterization before being delivered to Bremen, Germany, for MTG-S satellite integration. It is expected that the satellite will be completed by mid-2024, with a target launch before the end of the year.Paul Blythe, ESA's Meteosat Program Manager, commented, \"Following the launch of the MTG-I1 satellite, the momentum in the MTG program is relentless. On the one side we are supporting the operations and data analysis of the first satellite in orbit, whilst on the other, we push forward to ensure the availability and performance of the all-new MTG Sounding satellite.\"The initial results from MTG-I1 are hugely motivating for those who have worked on the program and creates a major impetus to complete the full MTG constellation by 2026.\" Provided byEuropean Space AgencyCitation:New weather satellite reveals spectacular images of Earth (2023, May 4)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-weather-satellite-reveals-spectacular-images.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_race": " Shadows around TW Hydrae",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the telescope that is observing TW Hydrae?",
  "answer_squad": " Hubble Space Telescope",
  "text": "The young star TW Hydrae is playing \"shadow puppets\" with scientists observing it with NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.          In 2017, astronomers reported discovering a shadow sweeping across the face of a vast pancake-shaped gas-and-dust disk surrounding the red dwarf star. The shadow isn't from a planet, but from an inner disk slightly inclined relative to the much larger outer disk\u2014causing it to cast a shadow. One explanation is that an unseen planet's gravity is pulling dust and gas into the planet's inclined orbit.Now, a second shadow\u2014playing a game of peek-a-boo\u2014has emerged in just a few years between observations stored in Hubble's MAST archive. This could be from yet another disk nestled inside the system. The two disks are likely evidence of a pair of planets under construction.TW Hydrae is less than 10 million years old and resides about 200 light-years away. In its infancy, our solar system may have resembled the TW Hydrae system, some 4.6 billion years ago. Because the TW Hydrae system is tilted nearly face-on to our view from Earth, it is an optimum target for getting a bull's-eye-view of a planetary construction yard.The second shadow was discovered in observations obtained on June 6, 2021, as part of a multi-year program designed to track the shadows in circumstellar disks. John Debes of AURA/STScI for the European Space Agency at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, compared the TW Hydrae disk to Hubble observations made several years ago.\"We found out that the shadow had done something completely different,\" said Debes, who is principal investigator and lead author of the study published in The Astrophysical Journal. \"When I first looked at the data, I thought something had gone wrong with the observation because it wasn't what I was expecting. I was flummoxed at first, and all my collaborators were like: what is going on? We really had to scratch our heads and it took us a while to actually figure out an explanation.\"The best solution the team came up with is that there are two misaligned disks casting shadows. They were so close to each other in the earlier observation they were missed. Over time they've now separated and split into two shadows. \"We've never really seen this before on a protoplanetary disk. It makes the system much more complex than we originally thought,\" he said.                Comparison images from the Hubble Space Telescope, taken several years apart, have uncovered two eerie shadows moving counterclockwise across a gas-and-dust disk encircling the young star TW Hydrae. The disks are tilted face-on to Earth and so give astronomers a bird's-eye view of what's happening around the star. The left image, taken in 2016, shows just one shadow [A] at the 11:00 o'clock position. This shadow is cast by an inner disk that is slightly inclined to the outer disk and so blocks starlight. The picture on the left shows a second shadow that emerged from yet another nested disk [C] at the 7:00 o'clock position, as photographed in 2021. The original inner disk is marked [B] in this later view. The shadows rotate around the star at different rates like the hands on a clock. They are evidence for two unseen planets that have pulled dust into their orbits. This makes them slightly inclined to each other. This is a visible-light photo taken with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. Artificial color, to enhance details, has been added. Credit: NASA, ESA, STScI, John Debes (AURA/STScI for ESA)IMAGE PROCESSING: Joseph DePasquale (STScI)             The simplest explanation is that the misaligned disks are likely caused by the gravitational pull of two planets in slightly different orbital planes. Hubble is piecing together a holistic view of the architecture of the system.The disks may be proxies for planets that are lapping each other as they whirl around the star. It's sort of like spinning two vinyl phonograph records at slightly different speeds. Sometimes labels will match up but then one gets ahead of the other.\"It does suggest that the two planets have to be fairly close to each other. If one was moving much faster than the other, this would have been noticed in earlier observations. It's like two race cars that are close to each other, but one slowly overtakes and laps the other,\" said Debes.The suspected planets are located in a region roughly the distance of Jupiter from our Sun. And, the shadows complete one rotation around the star about every 15 years\u2014the orbital period that would be expected at that distance from the star.Also, these two inner disks are inclined about five to seven degrees relative to the plane of the outer disk. This is comparable to the range of orbital inclinations inside our solar system. \"This is right in line with typical solar system style architecture,\" said Debes.The outer disk that the shadows are falling on may extend as far as several times the radius of our solar system's Kuiper belt. This larger disk has a curious gap at twice Pluto's average distance from the Sun. This might be evidence for a third planet in the system.Any inner planets would be difficult to detect because their light would be lost in the glare of the star. Also, dust in the system would dim their reflected light. ESA's Gaia space observatory may be able to measure a wobble in the star if Jupiter-mass planets are tugging on it, but this would take years given the long orbital periods.The TW Hydrae data are from Hubble's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. The James Webb Space Telescope's infrared vision may also be able to show the shadows in more detail.

  "text": "There is a reason that NASA's Opportunity rover explored Mars's Meridiani Planum region for 14 years: The locale could hold crucial hints about the Red Planet's early geology and environment.          The region's Burns formation, a layer of sandstone embedded with spherules of hematite referred to as \"blueberries,\" is of particular interest to scientists because it shows hallmarks of liquid water and has a sulfur-rich composition that echoes features common across Mars. The Burns formation lies atop a thin rock layer called the Grasberg formation, and in a new study published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, Thomas McCollom and Brian Hynek propose a novel, common origin story for the two.The idea is based on the recent finding that the Burns and Grasberg rocks are chemically similar, except that the former are enriched in magnesium and sulfate.Previously, there were two main hypotheses to explain the Burns formation's chemical composition. One family of models suggested that the original sands were a combination of ancient silicates and sulfate salts of iron, magnesium, and calcium that precipitated from evaporating groundwater on the margins of ancient lakes. A second group of models proposed that the sandstones began as basaltic ash and were transformed through the addition of volcanic or atmospheric sulfuric acid.The authors of the new study put forth a third possibility, that the two formations may come from the same source material, or at least a very similar one. They proposed that the Burns/Grasberg precursor was deposited onto Meridiani Planum as particles of dust or falling ash from nearby volcanic eruptions.These materials solidified, were weathered to the size of sand grains, and were blown by the wind to their current location. Once settled, the sand dunes experienced periodic flows of groundwater, which enriched the upper layers in magnesium and sulfate. Water flow also cemented the sediments to form the sandstones observed by Opportunity.The study's authors constructed a mass balance model simulating this scenario, and using data collected by Opportunity's Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer, they determined that the new hypothesis better matches Opportunity's observations than other previously proposed mechanisms do.The findings could shift how scientists think about the environmental conditions on early Mars and transform interpretations of the origin of sulfate-rich deposits found elsewhere on the planet.

  "text": "A \"beautiful effect\" predicted by quantum electrodynamics (QED) can explain the puzzling first observations of polarized X-rays emitted by a magnetar\u2014a neutron star featuring a powerful magnetic field, according to a Cornell astrophysicist.          The extremely dense and hot remnant of a massive star, boasting a magnetic field 100 trillion times stronger than Earth's, was expected to generate highly polarized X-rays, meaning that the radiation's electromagnetic field did not vibrate randomly but had a preferred direction.But scientists were surprised when NASA's Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) satellite last year detected that lower- and higher-energy X-rays were polarized differently, with electromagnetic fields oriented at right angles to each other.The phenomenon can be naturally explained as a result of \"photon metamorphosis\"\u2014a transformation of X-ray photons that has been theorized but never directly observed, said Dong Lai, Ph.D. '94, the Benson Jay Simon '59, MBA '62, and Mary Ellen Simon, M.A. '63, Professor of Astrophysics in the College of Arts and Sciences.\"In this observation of radiation from a faraway celestial object, we see a beautiful effect that is a manifestation of intricate, fundamental physics,\" Lai said. \"QED is one of the most successful physics theories, but it had not been tested in such strong magnetic field conditions.\"Lai is the author of \"IXPE Detection of Polarized X-rays from Magnetars and Photon Mode Conversion at QED Vacuum Resonance,\" published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The research builds on calculations Lai and Wynn Ho, Ph.D. '03, published 20 years ago, incorporating observations NASA reported last November of the magnetar 4U 0142+61, located 13,000 light-years away in the Cassiopeia constellation.Quantum electrodynamics, which describes microscopic interactions between electrons and photons, predicts that as X-ray photons exit the neutron star's thin atmosphere of hot, magnetized gas, or plasma, they pass through a phase called vacuum resonance.There, Lai said, photons, which have no charge, can temporarily convert into pairs of \"virtual\" electrons and positrons that are influenced by the magnetar's super-strong magnetic field even in vacuum, a process called \"vacuum birefringence.\" Combined with a related process, plasma birefringence, conditions are created for the polarity of high-energy X-rays to swing 90 degrees relative to low-energy X-rays, according to Lai's analysis.\"You can think about the polarization as two flavors of photons,\" he said. \"A photon suddenly converting from one flavor to another\u2014you don't usually see this kind of thing. But it's a natural consequence of the physics if you apply the theory under these extreme conditions.\"The IXPE mission did not see the polarization swing in observations of another magnetar, called 1RXS J170849.0-400910, with an even stronger magnetic field. Lai said that's consistent with his calculations, which suggest vacuum resonance and photon metamorphosis would occur very deep inside such a neutron star.Lai said his interpretation of IXPE's observations of the magnetar 4U 0142+61 helped constrain its magnetic field and rotation, and suggested that its atmosphere was likely composed of partially ionized heavy elements.Ongoing study of X-rays from some of the universe's most extreme objects, including neutron stars and black holes, he said, enables scientists to probe the behavior of matter in conditions that can't be replicated in labs, and adds to understanding of the universe's beauty and diversity.\"The observations by IXPE have opened a new window for studying the surface environment of neutron stars,\" Lai said. \"This will lead to new insights into these enigmatic objects.\" More information:Dong Lai, IXPE detection of polarized X-rays from magnetars and photon mode conversion at QED vacuum resonance, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

  "answer_squad": " 6,116 K",
  "text": "Using the Nanshan One-meter Wide-field Telescope (NOWT), astronomers from China have performed a photometric survey of the old open cluster NGC 188. In result, they identified many variable stars, one of which was detected for the first time. The finding was reported April 25 on the arXiv pre-print repository.          Detecting and studying variable stars could offer important hints into aspects of stellar structure and evolution. Investigation of variables could be also helpful for a better understanding of the distance scale of the universe.Located some 5,400 light years away in the constellation Cepheus, NGC 188 (also known as Caldwell 1) is a well-studied Galactic open cluster (OC) estimated to be about 6.8 billion years old. It is one of the most ancient, rich OCs in the Milky Way galaxy and is known to host dozens of variable stars.A group of researchers led by Fang-Fang Song of the Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory in China, has conducted another study of NGC 188, identifying 25 variable stars, out of which one turned out to be new detection. They employed NOWT to carry out the charge-coupled device (CCD) photometric survey of this cluster.\"In this paper, we have presented the time-series V-band photometric survey of the open cluster NGC 188, with particular emphasis on variable stars,\" the researchers wrote.All in all, the study detected 25 variable stars in a 55 \u00d7 45 arcmin2 (corresponding to 2,900 \u00d7 2,400 pixels) field of view around NGC 188. The variables received designations V1 to V25, and the results suggest that 16 variables are cluster members while the remaining stars belong to the field star population.The newly discovered star, designated V18, is a periodic variable with a period of approximately 0.317 days. The results indicate that it is a field star about 6,000 light years away, with an effective temperature of 6,116 K.According to the authors of the paper, the collected data suggest that V18 is most likely a W Ursae Majoris, W UMa (EW) for short, system. In general, EWs are eclipsing binary variable stars\u2014close binaries of spectral types F, G, or K that share a common envelope of material and are in contact with one another. Besides V18, there are 11 other EWs in the sample of 25 identified variables\u2014from V1 to V11.The data obtained by Song's team also allowed them to reclassify one previously known variable\u2014V21 (other designation V0769 Cep). NOWT observations show that V21 is likely an EA-type eclipsing binary, given that a 0.5 magnitude eclipse was detected in its light curve, rather than BY Draconis type variable\u2014as was suggested by previous studies.

  "text": "GOES-U, the fourth and final satellite in NOAA's GOES-R Series, recently completed a successful test deployment of its solar array to ensure it will function properly in space.          This critical test verified that the satellite's large, five-panel solar array\u2014which is folded up when the satellite is launched\u2014will properly deploy when GOES-U reaches geostationary orbit. During this test, engineers unfurled the five panels on rails that simulated the zero-gravity environment of space. Each solar panel is approximately 13 feet tall by 4.5 feet wide and weighs approximately 45 pounds.Once GOES-U reaches orbit, the deployed solar panels will form a single solar array wing that will rotate once per day to continuously point its photovoltaic (solar) cells toward the sun. The photovoltaic cells will convert energy from the sun into electricity to power the entire satellite, including the instruments, computers, data processors, sensors, and telecommunications equipment. The solar array will generate more than 5,000 watts of power for the satellite. This is equivalent to the power needed to run a central air conditioning system in your home.The solar array was developed and built by Lockheed Martin at its Sunnyvale, California, facility and tested at Lockheed Martin's facility in Littleton, Colorado, where GOES-U was assembled. GOES-U is scheduled to launch in April 2024.The GOES-R Program is a collaborative effort between NOAA and NASA. NASA builds and launches the satellites for NOAA, which operates them and distributes their data to users worldwide.

Under the Artemis program, the US space agency plans to maintain a human presence, for the very first time, on a celestial body other than Earth.          But building a lunar base is no small feat. It will need power generators, vehicles and habitats, and the space industry is racing to meet the technological challenges.\"It's the Super Bowl of engineering,\" Neal Davis, lead systems engineer for the Lunar Terrain Vehicle at space company Dynetics, told AFP.Dynetics revealed its prototype design for a Moon rover last month at the Space Symposium in Colorado Springs.But it probably won't be until later Artemis missions\u20147 onwards\u2014\"where we're starting to look at adding permanent habitations on the surface,\" said NASA associate administrator Jim Free.Artemis 3, the first planned landing, won't happen until later this decade, so habitat building wouldn't start before the 2030s.The base would likely comprise multiple sites, he added, to diversify the targets of scientific exploration and to offer more flexibility for the landings.Power and communicationsDespite this distant timeline, companies are already chomping at the bit.\"Step zero is communications,\" Joe Landon, CEO of Crescent Space, a new subsidiary of Lockheed Martin dedicated to lunar services, told AFP.\"Think about when you move into a new apartment, you've got to hook up your phone and your internet first.\"Starting out with a pair of satellites, the company wants to become the Moon's internet and GPS provider.This would relieve the strain on NASA's Deep Space Network, which threatens to overheat in the face of all the upcoming missions, including private ones.                This image courtesy of Astrobotic shows an artistic illustration of LunaGrid, a power generation and distribution service developed for the Moon.             Landon estimates the value of the lunar market will be \"$100 billion over the next 10 years.\"Next up: switching on the lights.Astrobotic, with 220 employees, is one of three companies selected by NASA to develop solar panels.They need to be placed vertically because at the Moon's south pole\u2014the intended destination because it has water in the form of ice\u2014the Sun barely peeps above the horizon.About 60 feet (18 meters) high, the Astrobotic panels will be connected by cables running several miles (kilometers), said Mike Provenzano, the company's director of lunar surface systems.The solar arrays will be fixed to vehicles that can run them out to different locations.      VehiclesFor its scientific expeditions, NASA has tasked industry with developing an unpressurized\u2014that is to say, open top\u2014rover for two people, ready by 2028.Unlike the Apollo missions' rovers, it will also have to operate autonomously for outings without an astronaut.This means surviving frigid lunar nights, which can last two weeks, with temperatures dropping to around -280 degrees Fahrenheit (-170 Celsius).Many companies have made a start.Lockheed Martin has partnered with General Motors, leaning on the auto giant's expertise in electric and off-road vehicles.Dynetics, a subsidiary of engineering behemoth Leidos, has joined forces with Nascar.                Dynetics' prototype, which will achieve a top speed of nine miles per hour (15 kph), includes a robotic arm and metal wheels that are braided like textiles, to maximize traction on the sandy surface and deal with any rocks they encounter.             Its prototype, which will achieve a top speed of nine miles per hour (15 kilometers per hour), includes a robotic arm and metal wheels that are braided like textiles to maximize traction on the sandy surface and deal with any rocks they encounter.\"But at the same time, they actually have a lot of openings to the outside so that they don't collect that sand and carry it with us,\" Davis said.Moon dust, or regolith, poses a major challenge because, lacking erosion by water or wind, it is almost as abrasive as glass.NASA has yet to announce the selected company or companies.In the longer term, NASA is working with the Japanese space agency JAXA on a pressurized vehicle, in which astronauts won't need to keep their suits on.HabitatsFinally, the crew will need a place to hang up their helmets and call home.NASA has awarded a $57.2 million contract to the Texas-based company Icon, which specializes in 3D printing, to develop the technology needed to build roads, landing strips on the Moon, and ultimately, dwellings.The idea is to use lunar soil as a material. Other companies, such as Lockheed Martin, are developing inflatable habitat concepts.\"The beautiful thing is you can land it on the moon and inflate it and now there's a much larger volume for the crew to live in and work in,\" Kirk Shireman, vice president for the Lockheed Martin Lunar Exploration Campaign, told AFP.Inside would be bedrooms, a kitchen, a space for scientific instruments, etc.\u2014all mounted on a frame, so the habitat can be mobile.The basic concept behind returning to the Moon under Artemis is to help NASA prepare for much more distant missions to Mars.\"Whatever money we have to spend to go develop these systems on the moon, we want those same systems to be applicable to go to Mars,\" said Shireman.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:What will the Artemis Moon base look like?

  "text": "In August 1865, a 10-pound rock fell from space to Earth, landing with a bang in the remote village of Sherghati, India. After being recovered by witnesses to the event, the stone passed into the possession of a local British magistrate who endeavored to identify the source of the strange object. After more than a century of studying the meteorite fragments\u2014so-called shergottites\u2014researchers in the 1980s finally determined its alien origins: our neighboring planet, Mars.          Until humans are able to bring back samples from Mars, the only pieces of the Red Planet found on Earth are Martian meteorites such as the shergottites. The journey for these little Martian travelers has been violent: for Mars rocks to get to Earth, they must have been ejected from the Red Planet's surface with enough force to escape Martian gravity. This ejection was likely due to a large impact on Mars. The rocks withstood the massive temperatures and pressures of this impact and flew through the vacuum of space, eventually crash-landing on our own planet.For decades, scientists have worked on modeling the kind of Martian impact events that send bits of the Red Planet to Earth. Now, researchers at Caltech and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which Caltech manages for NASA, have conducted experiments to simulate the so-called \"shock pressure\" experienced by Martian rocks. They have found that the pressure required to launch a rock from Mars into space is much lower than originally thought.The research was conducted in the laboratory of Paul Asimow, the Eleanor and John R. McMillan Professor of Geology and Geochemistry. The study is described in a paper appearing in the journal Science Advances on May 3 and is a collaboration with JPL.                Two impact-cratered target assemblies. The overall chamber is made of stainless steel. Rock samples are placed in the center of the chamber. The black stains are from decomposed plastic sabot and O-rings of the projectile. Credit: Jinping Hu             Meteorites from varied sources have been discovered on Earth for millennia, but their origins were not known until much more recently. As NASA's Viking orbiters made measurements of Mars's atmospheric composition in the late 1970s, Caltech's Ed Stolper (now the Judge Shirley Hufstedler Professor of Geology) was one of the first to suggest that shergottites are from Mars\u2014confirmed later when gases in the thin Martian atmosphere matched up with the gases encapsulated in the meteorites.But that is not all a meteorite's composition can tell us about its journey. One major component of Martian rocks is the crystalline mineral plagioclase. Under high pressures, such as an intense impact, plagioclase transforms into the glassy material known as maskelynite. Finding maskelynite in a rock, therefore, indicates the types of pressure the sample came into contact with. In the last five years, Martian meteorites have been discovered with a blend of both plagioclase and maskelynite, indicating an upper bound for the pressures they were subjected to.      In the new study, led by Caltech staff scientist Jinping Hu, the team conducted experiments to smash plagioclase-containing rocks from Earth and observe how the mineral transforms under pressure. The team developed a more accurate method to simulate Martian impacts in shock-recovery experiments, utilizing a powerful \"gun\" to blast rocks with projectiles traveling over five times the speed of sound. Previous shock-pressure experiments required reverberating shock waves through a steel chamber, which gives an inaccurate picture of what happens during an impact event on Mars.\"We're not on Mars, so we can't watch a meteorite strike in person,\" says Yang Liu, a planetary scientist at JPL and a co-author on the study. \"But we can recreate a similar kind of impact in a lab setting. By doing so, we found it takes much less pressure to launch a Mars meteorite than we thought.\"                Setup of the 20 mm gun in the Shockwave Laboratory in GPS for recovery experiments. The length of the barrel is ~7 feet. The laser is used to measure the projectile velocity. Credit: Jinping Hu             Previous experiments had shown that plagioclase turns into maskelynite at a shock pressure of 30 gigapascals (GPa), which is 300,000 times the atmospheric pressure one experiences at sea level, or 1,000 times the pressure a submersible comes into contact with while diving beneath 3 kilometers of ocean water.This new study shows that the transition actually happens at around 20 GPa\u2014a significant difference from previous experiments. In particular, the new pressure threshold is consistent with evidence from other high-pressure minerals in these meteorites indicating that their shock pressures must have been less than 30 GPa. Nine out of the 10 high-pressure minerals found in Martian meteorites were discovered at Caltech in studies led by mineralogist Chi Ma, Caltech's director of analytical facilities, and a co-author of the study.\"It has been a significant challenge to model an impact that can launch intact rocks from Mars while shocking them to 30 GPa,\" Asimow says. \"In this context, the difference between 30 GPa and 20 GPa is significant. The more accurately we can characterize the shock pressures experienced by a meteorite, the more likely it becomes that we can identify the impact crater on Mars from which it originated.\" More information:Jinping Hu et al, Shock-recovered maskelynite indicates low-pressure ejection of shergottites from Mars, Science Advances (2023).

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the European company that has been contracted to design a space station?",
  "answer_squad": " Airbus",
  "text": "The International Space Station (ISS) is nearing the end of its service. While NASA and its partners have committed to keeping it in operation until 2030, plans are already in place for successor space stations that will carry on the ISS' legacy.          China plans to assume a leading role with Tiangong, while the India Space Research Organization (ISRO) plans to deploy its own space station by mid-decade. NASA has also contracted with three aerospace companies to design commercial space stations, including Blue Origin's Orbital Reef, the Axiom Space Station (AxS), and Starlab.Well, buckle up. The European multinational aerospace giant Airbus has thrown its hat into the ring. In a recently-released video, the company detailed its proposal for a Multi-Purpose Orbital Module (MPOP) called the Airbus LOOP.This modular space segment contains three decks, a centrifuge, and enough volume for a crew of four, making it suitable for future space stations and long-duration missions to Mars. The LOOP builds on the company's long history of human spaceflight programs, like the ISS Columbus Module, the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), and the Orion European Service Module (ESM).As you can see from the video below, the interior design consists of three levels (or decks). These include (from top to bottom) a habitation deck, a science deck, and a centrifuge that simulates gravity for two crewmembers at a time. The module measures eight meters (about 26 feet) in diameter and roughly the same length, providing close to 100 cubic meters (~3500 ft3) of volume.According to Airbus, separating the interior into different decks allows for an \"internal safe harbor concept,\" meaning that the crew can move to the deck that affords the most protection in the event of a solar flare or other hazards.Each deck is accessible via a central tunnel surrounded by a greenhouse structure that can accommodate plant experiments and provide a steady supply of supplemental greens, legumes, and other plants (similar to greenhouses aboard the ISS). The module is designed for a crew of four but can reportedly accommodate up to eight astronauts at a time (temporarily). The deck selection can be adapted to individual mission requirements and objectives, or the mechanical structure can be used alone (a \"dry module\").Individual decks can be equipped with mission-specific machinery and infrastructure depending on the mission requirements. In the standard design, the Habitation Deck is essentially a \"common area\" with large windows and exercise equipment (stationary bikes).      The Science Deck is equipped with multiple computer terminals, an airlock that allows the crew to conduct extra-vehicular activities (EVAs), and smaller portholes to provide views of space. But what is perhaps the most interesting element of the LOOP is the centrifuge, which consists of two weights and two crew pods.These pods contain exercise bikes and can accommodate a single crewperson, allowing the crew to work out (two at a time) in a simulated gravity environment. This three-deck design meets all of the basic needs of long-duration stays in space and (according to Airbus) makes the LOOP compatible with all crew and cargo vehicles, including those currently in service and those in development. This includes the ISS, where the LOOP would be integrated to provide additional volume and even \"gravity therapy.\"                View of the Orbital Module\u2019s Three Decks. Credit: Airbus 2023             It could also be integrated into the Lunar Gateway or could act as the habitation module of the proposed Deep Space Transport (DST). Airbus also emphasizes that multiple LOOP modules can be combined to create a full-on space station, each outfitted with various decks to accommodate a range of operations and experiments. In this respect, the LOOP could occupy a role similar to what NASA had in mind with his proposed Non-Atmospheric Universal Transport Intended for Lengthy United States Exploration (Nautilus-X) concept.There's no indication yet of how much gravity the Centrifuge will be able to simulate, but some brought calculations using SpinCalc and SpaceCalc provided some estimates. According to both apps, the Centrifuge would need to have an angular velocity of 3.86 m/s (12.66 ft/s) and achieve 9.2 rotations per minute to simulate Martian gravity\u20143.72 m/s2, or about 38% of Earth's. It is possible it could be spun down to 2.55 m/s (8.35 ft/s), making six rotations per minute, to simulate Lunar gravity (about 16.5%) as well.This would be especially useful during missions to Mars since it would help mitigate the physiological effects of microgravity while acclimating the crew to what they will experience on the surface. Hopefully, more information will be available soon, including radiation shielding, materials, and weight estimates. Needless to say, NASA and other space agencies are facing some significant challenges when it comes to future missions and operations in space. These include renewed lunar exploration and development, the first crewed missions to Mars, and what to do once the ISS is decommissioned.As always, NASA has called upon the commercial space sector to provide innovative solutions to these challenges, and they are answering.

  "text": "Searching for life's building blocks light-years away is an important task of the James Webb Space Telescope. But how does it know what to look for? Ph.D. student Marina Gomes Rachid is offering a helping hand by mapping out molecules that could exist in deep space.          Imagine the headlights of a car on a misty day. A beam of light becomes visible in the fog, revealing particles of moisture floating in the air, absorbing and reflecting the light. Similarly, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observes how stars send infrared light through space, making the molecules it meets along the way visible. In seemingly empty areas of space, clouds filled with the smallest of particles appear.But it is very challenging to identify the molecules that the infrared light reveals remains very challenging. Even for a sophisticated device like the JWST, that is the largest of its kind.That's where the research of Gomes Rachid comes in. Over the past four years, during her Ph.D. at the Leiden University Laboratory for Astrophysics, the Brazilian identified some of the molecules the space telescope might come across. Thanks to this research, she could provide the JWST with an invaluable dataset.Marina calls it the \"chemistry of the skies\": looking at the stars from a chemist point of view. This offers a whole new perspective. Space might be unmeasurably vast, but every planet or comet is made up of tiny molecules, too small to even see with the naked eye. And they tell you more than you might think about our universe and ultimately ourselves.Gomes Rachid is interested in the molecules that are created during the early phase of the formation of a new star, when a huge cloud of gas and dust floats around in space. It's where the cosmic chemistry happens.Earlier research had already shown that many organic molecules are present in this kind of interstellar gas. Organic molecules are compounds that contain carbon (C), such as methane (CH4), and they are key to life. But the Ph.D. candidate wanted to go one step further and find out where these molecules are formed.To do this, she had to simulate the conditions of the deepest core of these gas clouds. There the temperature can reach as low as minus 250 degrees Celsius, causing almost all materials to freeze. \"In this cold interior, the cosmic air is a bit denser,\" Gomes Rachid says. \"That means atoms and molecules move closer to each other in the frozen material and new molecules are formed.\"In the Leiden laboratory, she observed how these frozen organic molecules absorbed the infrared light shined upon them. Looking at how each molecule absorbed the light, she measured its 'fingerprint' and added it to a database. Thanks to this information, the James Webb Space Telescope now knows precisely what all these tiny molecules look like in infrared light.Molecules light-years away from us might sound a little abstract, but they do tell us something about where life comes from. \"If these molecules are present in the frozen cores, as we expect them to be, it would mean prebiotic molecules can be formed in space,\" Gomes Rachid says. \"You could consider them as the starter kit for life. So eventually, this is also about our own origin.\" Provided byLeiden UniversityCitation:Hunting for life's building blocks at minus 250 degrees Celsius (2023, May 3)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-life-blocks-degrees-celsius.html  This document is subject to copyright.

On April 8, 2024, the eclipse will be total in a band stretching from Texas to Maine.          Both occurrences promise to be remarkable events and teachable moments. But preparation is essential.In The Physics Teacher, astronomer Douglas Duncan of the University of Colorado provides a practical playbook to help teachers, students, and the general public prepare for the eclipse events. He also shares ways to fundraise for schools and organizations and guidance for safe eclipse-viewing. The Fiske Planetarium, which Duncan used to direct, is also producing short videos about the upcoming eclipses.\"According to NASA surveys, over 100 million Americans watched the 2017 eclipse in person or via media,\" said Duncan. \"That was when a total eclipse crossed the U.S., with totality viewable in Wyoming, where Motel 6 rooms in the state were going for $800 a night if you didn't book far in advance. A total eclipse is worth traveling to. It is incredible, and people remember it their whole life.\"A self-described eclipse-chaser who has himself witnessed 12 eclipses beginning in 1970, Duncan emphasizes the importance of eye protection.

  "text": "The famous first image of a black hole just got two times sharper. A research team used artificial intelligence to dramatically improve upon its first image from 2019, which now shows the black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy as darker and bigger than the first image depicted.          I'm an astronomer who studies and has written about cosmology, black holes and exoplanets. Astronomers have been using AI for decades. In fact, in 1990, astronomers from the University of Arizona, where I am a professor, were among the first to use a type of AI called a neural network to study the shapes of galaxies.Since then, AI has spread into every field of astronomy. As the technology has become more powerful, AI algorithms have begun helping astronomers tame massive data sets and discover new knowledge about the universe.Better telescopes, more dataAs long as astronomy has been a science, it has involved trying to make sense of the multitude of objects in the night sky. That was relatively simple when the only tools were the naked eye or a simple telescope, and all that could be seen were a few thousand stars and a handful of planets.A hundred years ago, Edwin Hubble used newly built telescopes to show that the universe is filled with not just stars and clouds of gas, but countless galaxies. As telescopes have continued to improve, the sheer number of celestial objects humans can see and the amount of data astronomers need to sort through have both grown exponentially, too.For example, the soon-to-be-completed Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile will make images so large that it would take 1,500 high-definition TV screens to view each one in its entirety. Over 10 years it is expected to generate 0.5 exabytes of data\u2014about 50,000 times the amount of information held in all of the books contained within the Library of Congress.There are 20 telescopes with mirrors larger than 20 feet (6 meters) in diameter. AI algorithms are the only way astronomers could ever hope to work through all of the data available to them today. There are a number of ways AI is proving useful in processing this data.      Picking out patternsAstronomy often involves looking for needles in a haystack. About 99% of the pixels in an astronomical image contain background radiation, light from other sources or the blackness of space\u2014only 1% have the subtle shapes of faint galaxies.AI algorithms\u2014in particular, neural networks that use many interconnected nodes and are able to learn to recognize patterns\u2014are perfectly suited for picking out the patterns of galaxies. Astronomers began using neural networks to classify galaxies in the early 2010s. Now the algorithms are so effective that they can classify galaxies with an accuracy of 98%.This story has been repeated in other areas of astronomy. Astronomers working on SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, use radio telescopes to look for signals from distant civilizations. Early on, radio astronomers scanned charts by eye to look for anomalies that couldn't be explained. More recently, researchers harnessed 150,000 personal computers and 1.8 million citizen scientists to look for artificial radio signals. Now, researchers are using AI to sift through reams of data much more quickly and thoroughly than people can. This has allowed SETI efforts to cover more ground while also greatly reducing the number of false positive signals.Another example is the search for exoplanets. Astronomers discovered most of the 5,300 known exoplanets by measuring a dip in the amount of light coming from a star when a planet passes in front of it. AI tools can now pick out the signs of an exoplanet with 96% accuracy.Making new discoveriesAI has proved itself to be excellent at identifying known objects\u2014like galaxies or exoplanets\u2014that astronomers tell it to look for. But it is also quite powerful at finding objects or phenomena that are theorized but have not yet been discovered in the real world.Teams have used this approach to detect new exoplanets, learn about the ancestral stars that led to the formation and growth of the Milky Way, and predict the signatures of new types of gravitational waves.To do this, astronomers first use AI to convert theoretical models into observational signatures\u2014including realistic levels of noise. They then use machine learning to sharpen the ability of AI to detect the predicted phenomena.Finally, radio astronomers have also been using AI algorithms to sift through signals that don't correspond to known phenomena. Recently a team from South Africa found a unique object that may be a remnant of the explosive merging of two supermassive black holes. If this proves to be true, the data will allow a new test of general relativity\u2014Albert Einstein's description of space-time.Making predictions and plugging holesAs in many areas of life recently, generative AI and large language models like ChatGPT are also making waves in the astronomy world.The team that created the first image of a black hole in 2019 used a generative AI to produce its new image. To do so, it first taught an AI how to recognize black holes by feeding it simulations of many kinds of black holes. Then, the team used the AI model it had built to fill in gaps in the massive amount of data collected by the radio telescopes on the black hole M87.Using this simulated data, the team was able to create a new image that is two times sharper than the original and is fully consistent with the predictions of general relativity.Astronomers are also turning to AI to help tame the complexity of modern research. A team from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics created a language model called astroBERT to read and organize 15 million scientific papers on astronomy. Another team, based at NASA, has even proposed using AI to prioritize astronomy projects, a process that astronomers engage in every 10 years.As AI has progressed, it has become an essential tool for astronomers. As telescopes get better, as data sets get larger and as AIs continue to improve, it is likely that this technology will play a central role in future discoveries about the universe.

  "text": "They are called UFOs, but aliens have nothing to do with them. They are the ultra-fast outflows: space winds that emerge from the surroundings of supermassive black holes and blow at speeds close to that of light. An international research team has explored this still little-understood phenomenon, hunting for these gas emissions, which are crucial to understanding the mechanisms regulating the behavior of supermassive black holes in their active phase.          The research project is called SUBWAYS (SUper massive Black hole Winds in the x-rAYS) and the first results have been published in two papers in Astronomy & Astrophysics. The first of these, led by scholars from the University of Bologna and INAF, is mainly based on data obtained from ESA's XMM-Newton space telescope.The scholars analyzed 22 active galactic nuclei (AGN), i.e., the regions surrounding supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies and emitting enormous amounts of radiations across the entire electromagnetic spectrum when black holes are in the active phase. The investigation showed that in about 30% of the active galactic nuclei analyzed, there are space winds traveling at speeds between 10% and 30% of the speed of light.\"These results allow us to establish with greater certainty that a significant proportion of active galactic nuclei hosts ultra-fast winds called UFOs, ultra-fast outflows,\" explains Marcella Brusa, professor at the University of Bologna and INAF associate, as well as coordinator of the entire SUBWAYS project. \"And we were able to confirm that the intensity of these gas flows is sufficient to significantly change the ecosystem of their galaxies.\"Between a supermassive black hole and the galaxy that surrounds it, there is in fact a close relationship that reciprocally influences their formation and evolution. The mechanisms driving this reciprocal relationship are still poorly understood, but among the key ingredients may be the ultra-fast winds emitted by active galactic nuclei.

The wind propagates from the central engine (< 1 pc; a), through the surrounding ISM (1 pc\u20131 kpc; b), out to the boundaries of the host galaxy (> 10 kpc; c). SUBWAYS will investigate the outflow in its launching phase, when the gas is highly ionized, and the presence of fast moving material can be revealed in X-rays. (figure adapted from Cicone et al. 2018, Nat. As. 2, 176). Credit: University of Bologna             These powerful emissions arise when part of the gas in the accretion disk is ejected outwards, thus transferring some of the matter and energy produced to interstellar space, a mechanism that has important implications for regulating the process of star formation.In order to detect UFOs, spectra emitted in the X-ray band are analyzed, looking for absorptions produced by the presence of highly ionized materials such as iron. This phenomenon is due to the extreme temperatures\u2014up to tens of millions of degrees\u2014generated in the vicinity of supermassive black holes.      With this in mind, SUBWAYS scientists managed to obtain 1.6 million seconds of observation time (more than eighteen days) with the ESA XMM-Newton X-ray Space Telescope. They thus explored 17 active galactic nuclei in the relatively nearby universe (between about 1.5 and 5 billion light years away), to which they added data from another 5 AGN already collected in previous observations.\"These observations have allowed us to obtain new independent evidence of the existence of highly ionized matter that is ejected from the innermost regions of active galactic nuclei at speeds close to that of light,\" says Gabriele Matzeu, researcher at the University of Bologna, INAF associate and first author of the paper presenting the results on UFOs statistics. \"These outcomes have allowed us to learn more about these ultrafast winds and to better understand their role in shaping the evolution process of galaxies.\"The result of the research work was published in Astronomy & Astrophysics in the article 'Supermassive Black Hole Winds in X-rays: SUBWAYS.

The camera is mounted on the U.S. National Science Foundation's V\u00edctor M. Blanco 4-meter Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, a program of NSF's NOIRLab.       A ring of debris, named RCW 86, is all that remains of a white-dwarf star that exploded more than 1,800 years ago and was recorded by Chinese astronomers in the year 185 as a \"guest star.\"The DECam image confirms RCW 86 as the resulting structure of this historical supernova, SN 185 (supernova, year 185). Astronomers previously believed that it would take about 10,000 years for such a supernova to form the structure seen today. This would have made RCW 86 far older than the supernova observed in the year 185.The image of RCW 86 helps shed light on how the remains of the supernova evolved over the past 1,800 years. DECam's wide-field vision enabled astronomers to create this rare view of the entire supernova remnant.The estimate is in line with a comparatively youthful age of about 2,000 years, which strengthens the link between RCW 86 and the guest star observed centuries ago.While an accurate age estimate brought astronomers one step closer to understanding this unique stellar feature, one mystery still remained: How did RCW 86 expand so fast? The answer was uncovered when X-ray data of the region revealed large amounts of iron, a telltale sign of a type of blast in a binary star system when a dense white dwarf siphons material from its companion star to the point of detonation. SN 185 would have awed observers while it shone brightly in the night sky.

  "text": "By studying countless stars at various stages of their evolution, astronomers have been able to piece together an understanding of the life cycle of stars and how they interact with their surrounding planetary systems as they age. This research confirms that when a sun-like star nears the end of its life, it expands anywhere from 100 to 1,000 times its original size, eventually engulfing the system's inner planets. Such events are estimated to occur only a few times each year across the entire Milky Way. Though past observations have confirmed the aftermath of planetary engulfments, astronomers have never caught one in the act, until now.       With the power of the Gemini South Adaptive Optics Imager (GSAOI) on Gemini South, one half of the International Gemini Observatory, operated by NSF's NOIRLab, astronomers have observed the first direct evidence of a dying star expanding to engulf one of its planets. Evidence for this event was found in a telltale \"long and low-energy\" outburst from a star in the Milky Way about 13,000 light-years from Earth. This event, the devouring of a planet by an engorged star, likely presages the ultimate fate of Mercury, Venus, and Earth when our sun begins its death throes in about five billion years.\"These observations provide a new perspective on finding and studying the billions of stars in our Milky Way that have already consumed their planets,\" says Ryan Lau, NOIRLab astronomer and co-author on this study, which is published in the journal Nature.Astronomers using the Gemini South telescope in Chile, operated by NSF\u2019s NOIRLab, have observed the first compelling evidence of a dying sun-like star engulfing an exoplanet. The \"smoking gun\" of this event was seen in a long and low-energy outburst from the star\u2014the telltale signature of a planet skimming along a star\u2019s surface. This never-before-seen process may herald the ultimate fate of Earth when our own sun nears the end of its life in about five billion years. Credit: International Gemini Observatory/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/M. Garlick/M. Zamani/N. BartmannFor most of its life, a sun-like star fuses hydrogen into helium in its hot, dense core, which allows the star to push back against the crushing weight of its outer layers. When hydrogen in the core runs out, the star begins fusing helium into carbon, and hydrogen fusion migrates to the star's outer layers, causing them to expand, and changing the sun-like star into a red giant.Such a transformation, however, is bad news for any inner-system planets. When the star's surface eventually expands to engulf one of its planets, their interaction would trigger a spectacular outburst of energy and material. This process would also put the brakes on the planet's orbital velocity, causing it to plunge into the star.The first hints of this event were uncovered by optical images from the Zwicky Transient Facility. Archival infrared coverage from NASA's Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE), which is able to peer into dusty environments in search of outbursts and other transient events, then confirmed the engulfment event, named ZTF SLRN-2020. \"Our team's custom reanalysis of all-sky infrared maps from NEOWISE exemplifies the vast discovery potential of archival survey data sets,\" said NOIRLab astronomer Aaron Meisner, another co-author on the paper.                Credit: International Gemini Observatory/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/P. Marenfeld             Distinguishing a planetary-engulfment outburst from other types of outbursts, such as solar-flare-type events and coronal-mass ejections, is difficult and requires high-resolution observations to pinpoint the location of an outburst and long-term measurements of its brightness without contamination from nearby stars.Gemini South provided these essential data thanks to its adaptive-optics capabilities.\"Gemini South continues to expand our understanding of the Universe and these new observations support predictions for the future of our own planet,\" said NSF Gemini Observatory program director Martin Still. \"This discovery is a wonderful example of the feats we can accomplish when we combine world-class telescope operations and cutting-edge scientific collaboration.\"\"With these revolutionary new optical and infrared surveys, we are now witnessing such events happen in real time in our own Milky Way\u2014a testament to our almost certain future as a planet,\" said Kishalay De, an astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and lead author on the paper.The outburst from the engulfment lasted approximately 100 days and the characteristics of its lightcurve, as well as the ejected material, gave astronomers insight into the mass of the star and that of its engulfed planet. The ejected material consisted of about 33 Earth masses of hydrogen and about 0.33 Earth masses of dust. \"That's more star- and planet-forming material being recycled, or burped out, into the interstellar medium thanks to the star eating the planet,\" said Lau. From this analysis, the team estimated that the progenitor star is about 0.8\u22121.5 times the mass of our sun and the engulfed planet was 1\u221210 times the mass of Jupiter.Now that the signatures of a planetary engulfment have been identified for the first time, astronomers have improved metrics they can use to search for similar events happening elsewhere in the cosmos. This will be especially important when Vera C. Rubin Observatory comes on line in 2025. For instance, the observed effects of chemical pollution on the remnant star when seen elsewhere can hint that an engulfment has taken place. The interpretation of this event also provides evidence for a missing link in our understanding of the evolution and final fates of planetary systems, including our own.\"I think there's something pretty remarkable about these results that speaks to the transience of our existence,\" says Lau. \"After the billions of years that span the lifetime of our solar system, our own end stages will likely conclude in a final flash that lasts only a few months.\" More information:Kishalay De, An infrared transient from a star engulfing a planet, Nature (2023).

  "text": "Astronomers have conducted photometric observations of a white dwarf known as J004917.14\u2212252556.81. Results of the observational campaign detected photometric variability of this object, making J004917.14\u2212252556.81 the most massive pulsating white dwarf known to date. The finding is reported in a paper published April 18 in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.          White dwarfs (WDs) are stellar cores left behind after a star has exhausted its nuclear fuel. Although their atmospheres are mainly composed of hydrogen or helium, between 25% and 50% of all known white dwarfs show traces of metals in their spectra. In general, the majority of WDs have primary spectral classification DA\u2014they showcase hydrogen-dominated atmospheres.Located some 325 light years away, J004917.14\u2212252556.81 (or J0049\u22122525 for short) is a DA white dwarf with an effective temperature of 13,020 K and an estimated mass of approximately 1.3 solar masses. Previous studies have suggested that J0049\u22122525 may be a pulsating WD of the ZZ Ceti type, however, due to the lack of time-series photometric data, it was difficult to confirm this hypothesis.That is why a team of astronomers led by Mukremin Kilic of the University of Oklahoma in Norman, Oklahoma, decided to conduct time-series photometric observations of J0049\u22122525. For this purpose, they employed the Apache Point Observatory (APO) in New Mexico and the Gemini South telescope in Chile.The observations detected about 30 millimag variations in J0049\u22122525 at two different frequencies over four different nights. The finding makes J0049\u22122525 the most massive pulsating white dwarf known to date\u2014significantly more massive than the previous record holders BPM 37093 and GD 518.The study also found that J0049\u22122525 does not display any of the signatures of binary mergers and showcases no evidence of magnetism, rapid rotation, or large tangential velocity. Its spectrum was found to be of a typical DA white dwarf. These findings indicate that J0049\u22122525 likely formed through single star evolution and is likely to have an oxygen-neon (ONe) core.According to the authors of the paper, evolutionary models predict that the interior of J0049\u22122525 is crystallized. However, it is difficult to confirm this prediction with currently available data, so the astronomers propose further photometric investigations of this white dwarf.\"Because periods and their spacings vary with mass, effective temperature, hydrogen envelope mass, and the crystallized mass fraction, and because J0049\u22122525 displays only two significant modes in our APO and Gemini data, it is impossible to find a unique seismic solution.... A significant number of additional pulsation modes would need to be detected to overcome the degeneracies in the asteroseismic fits. We encourage extensive follow-up time-series photometry campaigns on this unique target,\" the researchers concluded.

  "text": "Using ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT), researchers have found, for the first time, the fingerprints left by the explosion of the first stars in the universe. They detected three distant gas clouds whose chemical composition matches what we expect from the first stellar explosions. These findings bring us one step closer to understanding the nature of the first stars that formed after the Big Bang.          \"For the first time ever, we were able to identify the chemical traces of the explosions of the first stars in very distant gas clouds,\" says Andrea Saccardi, a Ph.D. student at the Observatoire de Paris\u2013PSL, who led this study during his master's thesis at the University of Florence.Researchers think that the first stars that formed in the universe were very different from the ones we see today. When they appeared 13.5 billion years ago, they contained just hydrogen and helium, the simplest chemical elements in nature. These stars, thought to be tens or hundreds of times more massive than our sun, quickly died in powerful explosions known as supernovae, enriching the surrounding gas with heavier elements for the first time. Later generations of stars were born out of that enriched gas, and in turn ejected heavier elements as they too died.But the very first stars are now long gone, so how can researchers learn more about them? \"Primordial stars can be studied indirectly by detecting the chemical elements they dispersed in their environment after their death,\" says Stefania Salvadori, Associate Professor at the University of Florence and co-author of the study published today in The Astrophysical Journal.Using data taken with ESO's VLT in Chile, the team found three very distant gas clouds, seen when the universe was just 10%\u201315% of its current age, and with a chemical fingerprint matching what we expect from the explosions of the first stars. Depending on the mass of these early stars and the energy of their explosions, these first supernovae released different chemical elements such as carbon, oxygen and magnesium, which are present in the outer layers of stars.But some of these explosions were not energetic enough to expel heavier elements like iron, which is found only in the cores of stars. To search for the telltale sign of these very first stars that exploded as low energy supernovae, the team therefore looked for distant gas clouds poor in iron but rich in the other elements. And they found just that: three faraway clouds in the early universe with very little iron but plenty of carbon and other elements\u2014the fingerprint of the explosions of the very first stars.This peculiar chemical composition has also been observed in many old stars in our own galaxy, which researchers consider to be second-generation stars that formed directly from the \"ashes\" of the first ones. This new study has found such ashes in the early universe, thus adding a missing piece to this puzzle. \"Our discovery opens new avenues to indirectly study the nature of the first stars, fully complementing studies of stars in our galaxy,\" explains Salvadori.To detect and study these distant gas clouds, the team used light beacons known as quasars\u2014very bright sources powered by supermassive black holes at the centers of faraway galaxies. As the light from a quasar travels through the universe, it passes through gas clouds where different chemical elements leave an imprint on the light.To find these chemical imprints, the team analyzed data on several quasars observed with the X-shooter instrument on ESO's VLT. X-shooter splits light into an extremely wide range of wavelengths, or colors, which makes it a unique instrument with which to identify many different chemical elements in these distant clouds.This study opens new windows for next generation telescopes and instruments, like ESO's upcoming Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) and its high-resolution ArmazoNes high Dispersion Echelle Spectrograph (ANDES). \"With ANDES at the ELT we will be able to study many of these rare gas clouds in greater detail, and we will be able to finally uncover the mysterious nature of the first stars,\" concludes Valentina D'Odorico, a researcher at the National Institute of Astrophysics in Italy and co-author of the study.

  "text": "When Edwin Hubble observed distant galaxies in the 1920s, he made the groundbreaking discovery that the universe is expanding. It was not until 1998, however, that scientists observing Type Ia supernovae further discovered that the universe is not just expanding but has begun a phase of accelerating expansion. \"To explain this acceleration, we need a source,\" says Joseph Mohr, astrophysicist at LMU. \"And we refer to this source as 'dark energy,' which provides a sort of 'anti-gravity' to speed up cosmic expansion.\"          Scientifically, the existence of dark energy and cosmic acceleration are a surprise, and this indicates that our current understanding of physics is either incomplete or incorrect. The significance of the accelerating expansion was underscored in 2011 when its discoverers received the Nobel Prize in Physics. \"Meanwhile, the nature of dark energy has become the next Nobel Prize winning problem,\" says Mohr.Now I-Non Chiu from National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan, working in collaboration with LMU astrophysicists Matthias Klein, Sebastian Bocquet, and Joe Mohr, has published a first study of dark energy using the eROSITA X-ray telescope, which focuses on galaxy clusters. The work is published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.The anti-gravity possibly caused by dark energy pushes objects away from each other and suppresses the formation of large cosmic objects that would otherwise form due to the attractive force of gravity. As such, dark energy affects where and how the largest objects in the universe form\u2014namely, galaxy clusters with total masses ranging from 1013 to 1015 solar masses. \"We can learn a great deal about the nature of dark energy by counting the number of galaxy clusters formed in the universe as a function of time\u2014or in the observational world as a function of redshift,\" explains Klein.However, galaxy clusters are extremely rare and hard to find, requiring surveys of a large portion of the sky using the most sensitive telescopes in the world. To this end, the eROSITA X-ray space telescope\u2014a project led by the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) in Munich\u2014was launched in 2019 to carry out an all-sky survey to search for galaxy clusters. In the eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS), a mini-survey designed for performance verification of the subsequent all-sky survey, about 500 galaxy clusters were found. This represents one of the largest samples of low-mass galaxy clusters to date and spans the past 10 billion years of cosmic evolution.Energy density of dark energy appears to be uniform in space and constant in timeFor their study, Chiu and his colleagues used an additional dataset on top of the eFEDS data\u2014optical data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program, which is led by the astronomical communities of Japan and Taiwan, and Princeton University. The former LMU doctoral researcher I-Non Chiu and his LMU colleagues used this data to characterize the galaxy clusters in eFEDS and measure their masses using the process of weak gravitational lensing. The combination of the two datasets enabled the first cosmological study using galaxy clusters detected by eROSITA.Their results show that, through comparison between the data and theoretical predictions, dark energy makes up around 76% of total energy density in the universe. Moreover, the calculations indicated that the energy density of dark energy appears to be uniform in space and constant in time.\"Our results also agree well with other independent approaches, such as previous galaxy cluster studies as well as those using weak gravitational lensing and the cosmic microwave background,\" says Bocquet. \"So far, all pieces of observational evidence, including the latest results from eFEDS, suggest that dark energy can be described by a simple constant, usually referred to as the 'cosmological constant.'\"\"Although the current errors on the dark energy constraints are still larger than we would wish, this research employs a sample from eFEDS that after all occupies an area less than 1% of the full sky,\" says Mohr. This first analysis has thus laid a solid foundation for future studies of the full-sky eROSITA sample as well as other cluster samples.

  "text": "The first building blocks of life on Earth may have formed thanks to eruptions from our sun, a new study finds.          A series of chemical experiments show how solar particles, colliding with gases in Earth's early atmosphere, can form amino acids and carboxylic acids, the basic building blocks of proteins and organic life. The findings were published in the journal Life.To understand the origins of life, many scientists try to explain how amino acids, the raw materials from which proteins and all cellular life, were formed. The best-known proposal originated in the late 1800s as scientists speculated that life might have begun in a \"warm little pond\": A soup of chemicals, energized by lightning, heat, and other energy sources, that could mix together in concentrated amounts to form organic molecules.In 1953, Stanley Miller of the University of Chicago tried to recreate these primordial conditions in the lab. Miller filled a closed chamber with methane, ammonia, water, and molecular hydrogen\u2014gases thought to be prevalent in Earth's early atmosphere\u2014and repeatedly ignited an electrical spark to simulate lightning. A week later, Miller and his graduate advisor Harold Urey analyzed the chamber's contents and found that 20 different amino acids had formed.\"That was a big revelation,\" said Vladimir Airapetian, a stellar astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and co-author of the new paper. \"From the basic components of early Earth's atmosphere, you can synthesize these complex organic molecules.\"But the last 70 years have complicated this interpretation. Scientists now believe ammonia (NH3) and methane (CH4) were far less abundant; instead, Earth's air was filled with carbon dioxide (CO2) and molecular nitrogen (N2), which require more energy to break down. These gases can still yield amino acids, but in greatly reduced quantities.      Seeking alternative energy sources, some scientists pointed to shockwaves from incoming meteors. Others cited solar ultraviolet radiation. Airapatian, using data from NASA's Kepler mission, pointed to a new idea: energetic particles from our sun.Energy from our young sun\u20144 billion years ago\u2014aided in creating molecules in Earth's atmosphere that allowed it to warm up enough to incubate life. Credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center/Genna DubersteinKepler observed far-off stars at different stages in their lifecycle, but its data provides hints about our sun's past.

But solar \"superflares\"\u2014powerful eruptions we only see once every 100 years or so today\u2014would have erupted once every 3-10 days. These superflares launch near-light speed particles that would regularly collide with our atmosphere, kickstarting chemical reactions.\"As soon as I published that paper, the team from the Yokohama National University from Japan contacted me,\" Airapetian said.Dr. Kobayashi, a professor of chemistry there, had spent the last 30 years studying prebiotic chemistry. He was trying to understand how galactic cosmic rays\u2014incoming particles from outside our solar system\u2014could have affected early Earth's atmosphere. \"Most investigators ignore galactic cosmic rays because they require specialized equipment, like particle accelerators,\" Kobayashi said. \"I was fortunate enough to have access to several of them near our facilities.\" Minor tweaks to Kobayashi's experimental setup could put Airapatian's ideas to the test.Airapetian, Kobayashi, and their collaborators created a mixture of gases matching early Earth's atmosphere as we understand it today. They combined carbon dioxide, molecular nitrogen, water, and a variable amount of methane. (The methane proportion in Earth's early atmosphere is uncertain but thought to be low.) They shot the gas mixtures with protons (simulating solar particles) or ignited them with spark discharges (simulating lightning), replicating the Miller-Urey experiment for comparison.A close up of a solar eruption, including a solar flare, a coronal mass ejection, and a solar energetic particle event. Credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight CenterAs long as the methane proportion was over 0.5%, the mixtures shot by protons (solar particles) produced detectable amounts of amino acids and carboxylic acids. But the spark discharges (lightning) required about a 15% methane concentration before any amino acids formed at all.\"And even at 15% methane, the production rate of the amino acids by lightning is a million times less than by protons,\" Airapetian added. Protons also tended to produce more carboxylic acids (a precursor of amino acids) than those ignited by spark discharges.All else being equal, solar particles appear to be a more efficient energy source than lightning. But all else likely wasn't equal, Airapetian suggested. Miller and Urey assumed that lightning was just as common at the time of the \"warm little pond\" as it is today. But lightning, which comes from thunderclouds formed by rising warm air, would have been rarer under a 30% dimmer sun.\"During cold conditions you never have lightning, and early Earth was under a pretty faint sun,\" Airapetian said. \"That's not saying that it couldn't have come from lightning, but lightning seems less likely now, and solar particles seems more likely.\"These experiments suggest our active young sun could have catalyzed the precursors of life more easily, and perhaps earlier, than previously assumed.

  "text": "An instrument called ShadowCam is giving NASA's planned Artemis missions to the moon some advanced views of a landing site. It's mounted to the Danuri Korea Pathfinder Lunar orbiter sent to the moon last year. Lately, this amazing camera has been sending back some highly detailed images of the lunar north and south pole regions.          One view peers into the deeply shadowed Shackleton crater. It shows the track of a boulder that slid down from the rim. This impact crater lies smack on top of the south rotational pole of the moon. It dates back to an ancient impact some 3.6 billion years ago. Shackleton's 12-kilometer-deep interior is in perpetual shadow. That is, the sun never shines inside it. However, the mountains on its rim are always in sunlight.The ShadowCam is 200 times more light-sensitive than most other cameras used to study and map the moon from orbit. Its high-resolution images will provide a great deal of information for Artemis mission planners.ShadowCam is able to see inside Shackleton and other craters fairly well thanks to Earthshine. It also uses light reflected from nearby mountains and crater walls that do receive direct sunlight. Some of ShadowCam's images were captured during New moon when sunlight shining off of Earth's surface reaches the moon. These \"reflected light\" sources aren't bright, but ShadowCam was able to detect them.                Aristarchus Crater as seen in Earthshine during new moon. It\u2019s very possible that astronauts on the surface would be able to make their way around just by the light of earthshine. Credit: NASA/KARI/ASU             Shackleton: One of the intriguing lunar cratersNASA and other agencies landing astronauts on the moon want to explore the Shackleton crater polar region because there's a good chance that it contains water ice deposits. Over the years, lunar orbiters have studied and mapped this region. They've investigated the radiation regime and physical properties of the rocks and craters there. There appears to be an abundance of hydrogen, oxygen, silicon, iron, magnesium, calcium, aluminum, manganese, and titanium in the area.Future explorers could locate resource processing facilities in the region to mine materials needed for construction and other activities. In addition, thanks to its perpetual shadowed condition, this region offers a great place for astronomical observations in the future. All of that activity lies farther down the line, after Artemis III lands its astronauts on the surface. Their first mission will be only a few days, long enough to start an in-depth study of this fascinating area of the moon.The Artemis mission plans cover a variety of bases, from the chances for scientific discovery, and economic benefits, but also because new generations of explorers will be returning to the moon, more than half a century after the last ones left. The Artemis missions are part of an international cooperative effort that includes NASA, Canada, ESA, and others. Not to be outdone, the China National Space Administration also has set its sights on the moon. They recently announced missions that could take their first explorers to the lunar surface later on in this decade.

  "text": "Aliens on nearby stars could detect Earth through radio signals leaked from the planet, new research suggests.          Scientists from The University of Manchester and the University of Mauritius used crowd sourced data to simulate radio leakage from mobile towers to determine what alien civilizations might detect from various nearby stars, including Barnard's star, six light years away from Earth.The research, published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society journal, found that only more technologically advanced civilizations would be able to detect the current levels of mobile tower radio leakage from Earth. However, as most alien civilizations are likely to have more sensitive receiving systems and as we move towards more powerful broadband systems on Earth, the detectability of humans from other intelligent beings will become more and more likely.Professor Mike Garrett, Team Leader of the project and Director of Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at The University of Manchester, said, \"I've heard many colleagues suggest that the Earth has become increasingly radio quiet in recent years\u2014a claim that I always contested.\"\"Although it's true we have fewer powerful TV and radio transmitters today, the proliferation of mobile communication systems around the world is profound. While each system represents relatively low radio powers individually, the integrated spectrum of billions of these devices is substantial.\"\"Current estimates suggest we will have more than one hundred thousand satellites in low Earth orbit and beyond before the end of the decade. The Earth is already anomalously bright in the radio part of the spectrum; if the trend continues, we could become readily detectable by any advanced civilization with the right technology.\"The models, which demonstrate the signals that aliens may receive from Earth, were generated by Ramiro Saide, an intern at the Search for Extra-terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Instution's Hat Creek Radio Observatory and M.Phil student at The University of Mauritius.

Note the contribution made by the continent of Africa and other developing regions. Credit: Oxford University Press             The simulations also show that the Earth's mobile radio signature includes a substantial contribution from developing countries, including Africa, which the scientists say is an exciting development and highlights its success in bypassing the landline stage of development and moving directly into the digital age.Dr. Nalini Heeralall-Issur, Saide's supervisor and Associate Professor at the University of Mauritius, said, \"Every day we learn more about the characteristics of exoplanets via space missions like Kepler and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, with further insights from the James Webb Space Telescope. I believe that there's every chance advanced civilizations are out there, and some may be capable of observing the human-made radio leakage coming from planet Earth.\"Next, the research team is keen to extend their research to include other contributors to the Earth's radio leakage signature, such as powerful civilian and military radars, new digital broadcast systems, Wi-Fi networks, individual mobile handsets and the swarm of satellite constellations now being launched into low Earth orbit, such as Elon Musk's Starlink system.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the NASA rover that is collecting rocks on Mars?",
  "answer_squad": " Perseverance",
  "text": "Perseverance, a NASA rover, is collecting rocks on the surface of Mars, more than 200 million kilometers away. Though they could eventually become the most valuable rocks on Earth, the rover has limited space for these samples. That's where \"return sample scientists\" such as Chris Herd come in, lending their expertise to determine which samples could answer the greatest number of questions about Mars and further our understanding of the planet, including whether it has ever harbored life.          The highest quality samples are sealed and stored airtight on Perseverance, to await study on Earth in the future. A backup of each sample remains in a depot on Mars.\"The rovers have to be cleaned to a certain standard, and the sample tubes we send are probably the cleanest things that humanity has ever sent anywhere,\" says Herd, a professor in the Department of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences and curator of the University of Alberta's Meteorite Collection. This is to ensure that no contaminants or signatures of life from Earth make their way into the Martian samples.Each tube contains a sample of about 10 grams, and the rover has capacity to fill, seal and store 38 sample tubes; the follow on mission can bring only 30 back. So, return sample scientists need to be selective about what samples they capture. Once the tubes return to Earth, only a certain percentage of each may be used for analysis\u2014the remainder must be curated and archived.Modern technology and innovative tools mean the limited sample materials available shouldn't be an issue. \"We make the most of the least amount of material. We have an incredible array of instrumentation that allows us to do that,\" Herd says. \"There are ways we can analyze a sample that give us unprecedented detail about when the rock formed, how it was modified, whether there's any organic matter that could be evidence of life. There's a host of things we can tell from tiny amounts.\"Selecting information-rich samplesReturn sample scientists take various priorities into account when determining which samples to preserve in the tubes. They also consider the practicalities of what's available to sample once the rover reaches a particular site. The larger mission is broken down into smaller campaigns, each campaign targeting three to five samples.Within three weeks of each sampling event, return sample scientists must complete a report that details \"everything from the map view to the outcrop to the details of what we've learned about the rock as we sample it,\" Herd explains.While researchers on Earth already have samples of at least 175 Martian meteorites, they tend to provide a snapshot of a younger Mars, having been ejected from the planet after violent impacts early in its existence. Consequently they don't offer a full picture of what has been happening on the planet since.But Perseverance has already gathered igneous and sedimentary samples from sites in Jezero Crater. Researchers will compare the igneous samples obtained by the rover to some of those existing meteorite samples we already have on Earth, deepening our understanding of Mars. The sedimentary samples will fill a gap in our knowledge about Martian geology, as we currently have no sedimentary rocks from there.\"Those are even more interesting from an ancient biology perspective,\" Herd says. \"That's the reason we went to this landing site, because the rocks were laid down by liquid water some three and a half billion years ago and could preserve evidence of ancient life.\"Tools aboard Perseverance record the location of samples, provide insights into what the rocks are made of, and gather information about the environment each one is from, giving researchers invaluable context. Once sampling from Jezero Crater is complete, Herd estimates the team will have about half the available sample capacity remaining, to be used as the rover drives up and out of the crater.\"Each of those 15 or 16 samples could be unique and could represent a bigger range of ages and rock types than we've seen inside the crater.\"      The return to EarthIt won't be easy to bring the samples back to Earth. The task needs a lander (a spacecraft that can land on and leave a planetary surface), a rocket, and the ability to rendezvous with an orbiting interplanetary spacecraft. And on Earth, researchers need to be ready to handle the samples.\"There's a lot that we have to do to make sure we don't contaminate the samples with signatures of life from Earth and misinterpret that signature as life on Mars,\" Herd says. He says it's hard to imagine retrofitting an existing facility to house and study the samples appropriately and safely. Instead, he says a tailor-made facility could protect the samples from Earthly contaminants, while ensuring that our environment is safe from potentially harmful Martian contaminants. \"We need to get this right,\" he says, \"because this is answering a huge question.\"\"There's still a non-zero probability that there's extant life that has somehow managed to survive on Mars,\" Herd adds. This slim chance is due to the history of Mars, and it \"being warmer and wetter in the past and having that potential for microbial life.\"While there are still several years to wait until researchers can get their hands on the samples for analysis, the process is just as satisfying as the eventual payoff may be, according to Herd.\"It's absolutely phenomenal for me to be involved in such a huge mission, where we get to explore and get information about the rocks and the geology while at the same time sampling and looking forward to bringing those samples back,\" Herd says. \"That's what sets this mission apart.\" Provided byUniversity of AlbertaCitation:Choosing the Mars samples for future return to Earth (2023, May 2)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-mars-samples-future-earth.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "During observations of the merging galaxy cluster PSZ2 G277.93+12.34 with the MeerKAT radio telescope, an international team of astronomers have serendipitously detected a double radio relic and an odd radio circle. The discovery was detailed in a paper published April 24 on the arXiv pre-print repository.          Radio relics are diffuse, elongated radio sources of synchrotron origin. They occur in the form of spectacular single or double symmetric arcs at the peripheries of galaxy clusters. Astronomers are especially interested in the search for double relics as such features could provide crucial information about cluster mergers and the resultant emission.At a distance of about 2.5 billion light years away from the Earth, PSZ2 G277.93+12.34 is a galaxy cluster with a mass of some 360 trillion solar masses. The cluster is poorly studied, hence its members are currently not well defined. However, previous observations have found that a galaxy known as WISEA J103230.00\u2013433815.4 is most likely the brightest cluster galaxy of PSZ2 G277.93+12.34.A team of astronomers led by B\u00e4rbel S. Koribalski of the Western Sydney University in Australia, has recently investigated PSZ2 G277.93+12.34 with MeerKAT in order to shed more light on the nature of this cluster. Their study was complemented by radio continuum images from the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) and X-ray data from the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) space telescope.By analyzing MeerKAT 1.3 GHz radio continuum images of the PSZ2 G277.93+12.34, the researchers detected two large radio relics, located northeast and southwest of the cluster center, forming a double radio relic with an angular separation of approximately 16 arcminutes (about 8.5 million light years). The southern relic is relatively thin, has a linear extent of about 5.35 million light years, and a surface brightness of some 16 \ud835\udf07Jy/beam. When it comes to the northern relic, it is twice as wide as the southern one, has a linear extent of at least 2.15 million light years, and its surface brightness was found to be 55 \ud835\udf07Jy/beam.It was noted that the two relics together form a partial circle, occupying at least 35% of its circumference. According to the authors of the paper, the double relic morphology suggests a face-on orientation of the merger; however, low-frequency imaging of the PSZ2 G277.93+12.34 at both high resolution and high sensitivity is required in order to verify this.In addition to the discovery of the double radio relic, the astronomers also detected a new odd radio circle (ORC) at a redshift of about 0.3, in a different part of the MeerKAT images. The so-called ORCs are mysterious gigantic rings of radio waves and their origin is still unexplained.The newfound ORC, which received designation ORC J1017\u20134422, remains undetected in X-ray emission and has a diameter of about 1.3 million light years. It is the fourth single ORC so far identified. More information:B\u00e4rbel S. Koribalski et al, MeerKAT discovery of a double radio relic and odd radio circle, arXiv (2023).

They revealed a bright ring of hot orbiting gas surrounding a circular zone of darkness.Any light crossing the event horizon\u2014the black hole's point of no return\u2014becomes trapped forever, and any light passing close to it is redirected by the black hole's intense gravity. Together, these effects produce a \"shadow\" about twice the size of the black hole's actual event horizon.All monster black holes are not equal.

Located about 1,600 light-years apart, one weighs 6 million solar masses and the other more than 150 million suns. Astronomers say the pair will merge within the next 250 million years.\"Since 2015, gravitational wave observatories on Earth have detected the mergers of black holes with a few dozen solar masses thanks to the tiny ripples in space-time these events produce,\" said Goddard astrophysicist Ira Thorpe. \"Mergers of supermassive black holes will produce waves of much lower frequencies which can be detected using a space-based observatory millions of times larger than its Earth-based counterparts.\"                    The two bright knots at the center of galaxy NGC 7727 each represent a dense group of stars surrounding a supermassive black hole.

Credit: SDSS                 That's why NASA is collaborating with ESA (European Space Agency) to develop their LISA mission, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, expected to launch sometime in the next decade. LISA will consist of a constellation of three spacecraft in a triangle that shoot laser beams back and forth over millions of miles to precisely measure their separations. This will enable the detection of passing gravitational waves from merging black holes with masses up to a few hundred million suns. Astronomers are exploring other detection techniques to tackle even bigger mergers.At the animation's larger scale lies M87's black hole, now with a updated mass of 5.4 billion suns.

NASA has taken to the seas and skies to study the unique environment at the ocean's surface, where marine ecosystems intersect with our planet's complex atmosphere. On April 7, scientists participating in the Sub-Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics Experiment (S-MODE) embarked on the RV Sally Ride from San Diego on the last of three field expeditions to understand the ocean's role in the Earth's changing climate. They will be at sea for about a month until returning to San Diego on May 4, and they will operate for most of that period in tandem with an accompanying airborne campaign.\"There are small swirls on the ocean surface\u2014eddies\u2014that are challenging to see by satellites and models,\" said S-MODE scientist Kelly Luis, who is working aboard the RV Sally Ride. \"During campaigns like S-MODE, we get to be up close to them to understand their broader impact on the climate and oceans.\"The S-MODE mission, managed out of NASA's Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley, is gathering observations with airborne instruments, a research ship, and autonomous instruments like gliders that skim the upper layers of the Pacific Ocean. Data gathered from these different perspectives are being blended to form an unprecedented view of the whirlpools and eddies that affect the way the ocean absorbs and emits heat, greenhouse gases, and nutrients.Better understanding of ocean dynamics that are driven by those eddies at kilometer scales can tell researchers a lot about the ocean's role in global climate change. Models suggest that those eddies could have a net effect on air-sea exchange that is larger than the heating from the greenhouse effect. S-MODE is among the first NASA missions to test this conclusion with observations. Building on the previous S-MODE campaigns in October 2021 and 2022, scientists hope these three years of observations can help better characterize this significant energy transfer.Luis and colleagues are using ship-based instruments that measure ocean color to understand the creatures living near the surface. When sunlight hits the ocean, different wavelengths are scattered or absorbed. Part of that light transformation is due to the presence of phytoplankton\u2014microscopic organisms floating in the ocean's surface layer. Phytoplankton not only serve as a foundation of the marine food web, they also take up carbon dioxide and produce oxygen\u2014much like plants on land. These small creatures show how even the tiniest parts of the ocean ecosystem interact with the world above the ocean's surface.The researchers measure differences in ocean color to determine how much phytoplankton are contained within surface layers and which species. The findings are then compared against observations made from S-MODE instruments and sensors mounted on aircraft.The project is a team effort, with contributions from various NASA centers\u2014including NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California\u2014and from researchers with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of Washington, Oregon State University, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. With so many different teams coming together, collaboration and support are essential.\"My responsibility to the S-MODE team gets me up in the morning,\" Luis said. \"The ocean is a great teacher about the state of our planet, and we all have to be at the ready to carry out our jobs and support each other to learn as much as we can during research campaigns.\" Provided byNASACitation:NASA's last S-MODE mission studies the ocean's surface (2023, May 2)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-nasa-s-mode-mission-ocean-surface.html  This document is subject to copyright.

They lie somewhere in between, exhibiting traits of both. Lenticular galaxies have a central bulge of tightly packed stars and a thin, circular disk of stars, gas, and dust, like spiral galaxies, but they lack arms. And like elliptical galaxies, lenticular galaxies have older stellar populations and little ongoing star formation.       NGC 3489 has an active galactic nucleus, or AGN. The AGN sits at the center of the galaxy, is extremely bright, and emits radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum as the black hole devours material that gets too close to it.This lenticular galaxy is a Seyfert galaxy, which is a class of AGN that is dimmer than other types of AGNs. They generally don't outshine the rest of the galaxy, so the galaxy surrounding the black hole is clearly visible.

  "text": "Wildlife and environmental groups sued the Federal Aviation Administration on Monday over SpaceX's launch last month of its giant rocket from Texas.          SpaceX's Starship soared 24 miles (39 kilometers) high before exploding over the Gulf of Mexico on April 20. The rocket's self-destruct system caused the nearly 400-foot (120-meter) rocket to blow up, as it spun out of control just minutes into the test flight.An attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the plaintiffs, said the groups are suing over what they consider to be the FAA's failure to fully consider the environmental impacts of the Starship program near Boca Chica Beach in South Texas. They asked the court to throw out the five-year license the FAA granted to SpaceX.The FAA declined comment, noting it doesn't comment on ongoing litigation. The agency is overseeing the accident investigation and has ordered all SpaceX Starships grounded until it's certain that public safety will not be compromised.Over the weekend, SpaceX founder and chief executive, Elon Musk, said his company could be ready to launch the next Starship in six to eight weeks with the FAA's OK.No injuries or significant damage to public property were reported from any of the rocket wreckage or flying pad debris. A large crater was carved into the concrete pad, as most of the rocket's 33 main engines ignited at liftoff.The launch pad is on a remote site on the southernmost tip of Texas, just below South Padre Island, and about 20 miles from Brownsville.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reported last week that large concrete chunks, stainless steel sheets, metal and other objects were hurled thousands of feet (hundreds of meters) from the pad. In addition, a plume of pulverized concrete sent material up to 6.4 miles (4 kilometers) northwest of the pad, the service noted.It was the first launch of a full-size Starship, with the sci-fi-looking spacecraft on top the huge booster rocket. The company plans to use it to send people and cargo to the moon and, ultimately, Mars. NASA wants to use Starship to ferry astronauts to the lunar surface as soon as 2025.Joining the Center for Biological Diversity in the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, are the American Bird Conservancy, Surfrider Foundation, Save RGV (Rio Grande Valley) and the Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation of Texas.\"It's vital that we protect life on Earth even as we look to the stars in this modern era of spaceflight,\" the Center for Biological Diversity's Jared Margolis said in a statement. \"Federal officials should defend vulnerable wildlife and frontline communities, not give a pass to corporate interests that want to use treasured coastal landscapes as a dumping ground for space waste.\"Over the weekend, Musk said changes are being made at the launch pad to avoid what he called a dust storm and \"rock tornado\" at the next launch.\"To the best of our knowledge there has not been any meaningful damage to the environment that we're aware of,\" Musk said.Musk has promised to make improvements to the next Starship before it flies. The self-destruct system will need to be modified, he said, so that the rocket explodes immediately\u2014not 40 seconds or so afterward, as was the case with this inaugural run, he said.His remarks were made to a subscriber-only Twitter chat Saturday night that was later posted by others online.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

  "text": "One of the world's most powerful radio telescope arrays is joining the hunt for signals from other galactic civilizations. The National Science Foundation's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), situated about 50 miles west of Socorro, New Mexico, is collecting data that scientists will analyze for the type of emissions that only artificial transmitters make, signals that would betray the existence of a technically accomplished society.          \"The VLA is the go-to instrument for radio astronomers, but this is the first time we are using it in a wide-ranging and continuous search for technosignatures,\" said Andrew Siemion, Bernard M. Oliver Chair for SETI at the SETI Institute.The VLA is one of the most productive radio telescopes in the world and consists of 27 antennas spread over 23 miles of desert real estate. Since 2017, it has been engaged in a project known as VLASS (Very Large Array Sky Survey), a radio reconnaissance of 80% of the sky.But while these observations are being undertaken, a tap on the signal distribution network will shunt a copy of the data into a special receiver sporting very narrow (approximately one hertz wide) channels. Researchers expect that any signals from a deliberately constructed transmitter will contain such narrow-band components, and their discovery would indicate that the signal is not produced by nature, but by an alien transmitter.The new processing system for SETI is dubbed \"COSMIC\"\u2014the Commensal Open-Source Multimode Interferometer Cluster\u2014and is spearheaded by the SETI Institute, in collaboration with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and the Breakthrough Listen Initiative.

Credit: Chenoa Tremblay             \"COSMIC operates commensally, which means it works in the background using a copy of the data astronomers are taking for other scientific purposes,\" said Paul Demorest, Scientist and Group Lead for VLA/VLBA Science Support at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. \"This is an ideal and very efficient way to get large amounts of telescope time to search for rare signals.\"Unlike many previous SETI observations, a wide variety of transmissions, such as pulsed and transient signals, can be recognized by this new experiment. The range of frequencies to be monitored is unprecedented, and the tally of star systems examined will be approximately ten million.Since the beginning of 2023, signals from the Voyager 1 spacecraft have been detected by the COSMIC system to verify the operation of the individual antennas in the array as well as combining their observations to produce a result that clearly shows the carrier and sidebands of the transmissions from the spacecraft. Voyager 1 is currently at a distance of about 15 billion miles and is the most distant human-made object.                The detection of the Voyager I spacecraft using the COSMIC instrument on the VLA. Launched in 1977, the Voyager I spacecraft is now the most distant piece of human technology ever sent into space, currently around 14.8 billion miles from Earth. Voyager's faint radio transmitter is difficult to detect even with the largest telescopes, and represents an ideal human \u201ctechnosignature\u201d for testing the performance of SETI instruments. The detection of Voyager's downlink gives the COSMIC team high confidence that the system can detect similar artificial transmitters potentially arising from distant extraterrestrial civilizations. Credit: SETI Institute             \"The detection of Voyager 1 is an exciting demonstration of the capabilities of the COSMIC system,\" said Jack Hickish, founder, Real-Time Radio Systems Ltd. \"It is the culmination of an enormous amount of work from an international team of scientists and engineers. The COSMIC system is a fantastic example of using modern general-purpose compute hardware to augment the capabilities of an existing telescope and serves as a testbed for technosignatures research on upcoming radio telescopes such as NRAO's Next Generation VLA.\"When combined with the exquisite sensitivity of the VLA, COSMIC will be approximately a thousand times more comprehensive than any previous SETI search. History shows that major improvements in the sensitivity and range of exploratory experiments are often rewarded with the detection of a signal. If so, this effort might see the uncovering of a radio whisper that would tell us that we're not the only intelligent inhabitants of the Milky Way Galaxy.\"The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is proud to partner with the SETI Institute in this exciting initiative,\" said Tony Beasley, Director of the NRAO. \"Partnerships bringing together world-class research instruments, private research institutes, and members of the public personally committed to forefront science, can enable new important discoveries.\" Provided bySETI InstituteCitation:Massive radio array to search for extraterrestrial signals from other civilizations (2023, May 1)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-massive-radio-array-extraterrestrial-civilizations.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards the Starship test?",
  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What did Musk say the Starship prototype failed to do?",
  "answer_squad": " separate from the booster",
  "text": "It was an exciting time when, two weeks ago, SpaceX got the clearance it needed to conduct its first orbital flight test with the Starship and Super Heavy launch system. After years of waiting, SN flight tests, static fire tests, and stacking and unstacking, the long-awaited test of the SN24 Starship and BN7 Booster prototype was on. For this flight, SpaceX hoped to achieve an altitude of at least 150 km (90 mi) above sea level, crossing the 100 km (62 mi) threshold that officially marks the boundary of \"space\" (aka. the Karman Line) and making a partial transit around the world before splashing down off the coast of Hawaii.          Unfortunately, things began to go awry a few minutes into the flight as the Starship prototype failed to separate from the booster, sending the rocket into a spin that ended in an explosion. While Musk and SpaceX issued statements that the test was largely successful and lots of valuable data was obtained, residents and environmental researchers claim the explosion caused damage to houses in the area and the local environment. In response, the FAA has launched a \"mishap investigation,\" temporarily grounding the Starship until the explosion's impact can be assessed.The timing of the flight test was certainly fortuitous, falling on April 20th (4/20) exactly as Musk had previously predicted. Everything appeared to be in the green as all 33 engines of the BN7 booster fired, and the fully stacked and fueled prototype lifted off without incident. About three and a half minutes into the flight, when stage separation was supposed to occur, the Starship began an uncontrolled tumble and was destroyed by onboard charges. The SN24 and BN7 managed to reach an altitude of 40 km (25 miles) before the anomaly occurred.Musk commended the ground teams, tweeting, \"Congrats @SpaceX team on an exciting test launch of Starship! Learned a lot for next test launch in a few months.\" At the same time, it was clear that some sizeable changes needed to be made. In addition to the mid-air explosion, the launch also destroyed the launchpad, which sent debris flying in all directions. This raised the issue of a deluge system that the Boca Chica launch site does not have (unlike other launch facilities). These systems rely on a \"flame trench\" to channel rocket exhaust and water or foam to suppress shockwaves and flames.Musk was sure to temper expectations before the flight, saying in a Twitter discussion on April 16th that when you have a spacecraft that's got \"33 engines on the booster, got six engines on the upper stage of the ship. It's a lot of engines! It's like having a box of grenades, really big grenades.\" He was also sure to cite SpaceX's track record with rapid prototyping, which has always involved \"testing to failure\" and a lot of trial and error:\"This is really kind of the sort of first step in a very long journey that will require many, many flights. For those that have followed the history of Falcon 9, and Falcon 1 actually, and our attempts at reusability, I think it might have been close to 20 attempts before we actually recovered a stage. And then it took many more flights before we had reusability that was meaningful, where we didn't have to rebuild the whole rocket.\"      To residents and environmentalists, the test was not an occasion for celebration. Ever since SpaceX broke ground in Boca Chica and began testing, Musk has had a strained relationship with the locals, who have frequently complained about noise and the impact these tests have on their communities and the natural environment. According to Pablo De La Rosa, a reporter with Texas Public Radio (TPR) and NPR, there were multiple reports of \"particulates\" raining down on South Padre Island up the coast and on the nearby town of Port Isabel.Residents in the town also reported broken windows \"and ash-like particles covering their homes and schools.\" The Sierra Club cited similar reports, with Dan Cortez (Lone Star chapter director) stating in an interview with CNBC that the destruction of the launchpad caused collateral damage that could have been much worse. \"Concrete shot out into the ocean, and risked hitting the fuel storage tanks which are these silos adjacent to the launch pad,\" he said. With mid-air explosions, there are also concerns that residual propellant (which are often toxic) could rain down on the surface, causing environmental damage.A post-launch assessment by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is standard practice in cases like this. As the Administration explained in a statement regarding Recent Aviation Accidents and Incidents (issued on April 20th):\"The FAA will oversee the mishap investigation of the Starship / Super Heavy test mission. A return to flight of the Starship / Super Heavy vehicle is based on the FAA determining that any system, process, or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety. This is standard practice for all mishap investigations. The FAA is responsible for protecting the public during commercial space transportation launch and reentry operations.\"In other words, the FAA has effectively grounded SpaceX's testing efforts at Boca Chica until they can determine if future flight tests will threaten public health, safety, and the local environment. This will likely result in a list of mandatory actions that SpaceX must complete to keep its license and resume testing. At this juncture, Musk is already prepared to address the issue of a deluge system, which he has admitted his crews looked at in the past but decided was unnecessary. Nevertheless, he also hinted before the launch that \"melting the launch pad\" was a real possibility.In any case, Musk appeared to be admitting on April 21st that the decision to proceed without first installing a cooling system beneath the launchpad was a mistake, tweeting: \"3 months ago, we started building a massive water-cooled, steel plate to go under the launch mount. Wasn't ready in time & we wrongly thought, based on static fire data, that Fondag would make it through 1 launch. Looks like we can be ready to launch again in 1 to 2 months.\"At this juncture, a month or two seems optimistic, considering that the full impact could take weeks and corrective actions could take much longer to implement. It could turn out that the FAA will demand that a full deluge system is necessary, that additional protections are needed to prevent debris from striking fuel tanks, and that SpaceX install a launch abort system that will force the Starship and Super Heavy to separate in the event of an anomaly. This last item would ensure that at least the booster (the most explosive element) can remove itself and return safely to a landing site.It's even also remotely possible the FAA will revoke SpaceX's license, and Musk will decide to relocate all testing to Cape Canaveral, where SpaceX is still working on a second launch facility. Then again, this may all be resolved shortly, and SpaceX could be testing prototypes again by mid-summer. As the company's adage famously goes, \"Launch. Recover. Repeat.\" In this case, \"recover\" may mean repairing the damage caused by a test gone wrong and ensuring it never happens again. But the next step remains the same\u2014Repeat.Or, to paraphrase another famous adage, \"Explosion will continue until launches improve!\" Provided byUniverse TodayCitation:SpaceX Starship effectively grounded by FAA after in-flight explosion (2023, May 1)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-spacex-starship-effectively-grounded-faa.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Last week, NASA shared a blog post saying they detected a sensor glitch associated with the James Webb Space Telescope's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). For some reason, the sensor for MIRI's Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MRS) is receiving less light than expected at the longest wavelengths.          NASA is investigating the cause, and said that the instrument is not at risk and no effect has been seen for images taken by MIRI. According to agency officials, all other modes of JWST and MIRI remain unaffected, and they are searching for the underlying issue.The glitch was found this month during regular calibration and monitoring of the telescope's performance. NASA said they routinely monitor all 17 observing modes of the telescope and when they compared the brightness of standard stars that have been well-cataloged by other observatories to what MIRI was receiving, team members noticed a discrepancy in the data.They also compared how MIRI's spectroscopy mode is working now versus how it worked earlier in the mission and they found that at the longest wavelengths, the throughput, or the amount of light that is registered by MIRI's sensors, has decreased since the instrument was turned on and commissioned last year.This isn't the first issue MIRI's MRS has had. Last year in August, while preparing for observations with MIRI's MRS mode, the team detected increased friction with one of the wheels, and described the friction as \"grating\" or \"sticky.\" The function of the wheel is to select between short, medium and longer wavelengths. Engineers were able to figure out a way to work around the issue and observations were resumed in November 2022.                Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is a supernova remnant.

It allows the telescope to see in the wavelength range from 5 to 27 micrometers. The instrument has 4 modes: imaging, medium-resolution spectroscopy, low-resolution spectroscopy, and coronagraphy.Engineers for the mission do not yet know if the two glitches are related, but are currently developing a systematic plan to approach, analyze, and explore the issue.In the meantime, MIRI observations will continue as planned, and engineers will determine if there's a way to work around this issue, too.\"The team will gather all relevant ground test and flight data to fully assess MRS performance,\" wrote JWST communications specialist Thaddeus Cesari. \"Further test observations will be taken to completely characterize the nature of the issue using this particular mode of observation. Next, a plan for long term-monitoring will be enacted, while the team continues to investigate the cause, identify risks, and explore mitigations that would potentially improve performance.\"One possible mitigation or work-around strategy includes taking slightly longer exposures when observing at the longer wavelengths to increase the signal to noise.

  "answer_race": " Webb finds water vapor on rocky exoplanet",
  "question_squad": " What is the surface temperature of GJ 486b?",
  "answer_squad": " 800 degrees Fahrenheit",
  "text": "GJ 486 b is about 30% larger than the Earth and three times as massive, which means it is a rocky world with stronger gravity than Earth. It orbits a red dwarf star in just under 1.5 Earth days. It is too close to its star to be within the habitable zone, with a surface temperature of about 800 degrees Fahrenheit. And yet, Webb observations show hints of water vapor.          The water vapor could be from an atmosphere enveloping the planet, in which case it would need to be continually replenished due to losses from stellar irradiation. But an equally likely possibility is that the water vapor is actually from the outer layer of the planet's cool host star. Additional Webb observations will help answer the question: Can a rocky planet maintain, or reestablish, an atmosphere in the harsh environment near a red dwarf star?The most common stars in the universe are red dwarf stars, which means that rocky exoplanets are most likely to be found orbiting such a star. Red dwarf stars are cool, so a planet has to hug it in a tight orbit to stay warm enough to potentially host liquid water (meaning it lies in the habitable zone). Such stars are also active, particularly when they are young, releasing ultraviolet and X-ray radiation that could destroy planetary atmospheres. As a result, one important open question in astronomy is whether a rocky planet could maintain, or reestablish, an atmosphere in such a harsh environment.To help answer that question, astronomers used NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to study a rocky exoplanet known as GJ 486 b. It is too close to its star to be within the habitable zone, with a surface temperature of about 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius). And yet, their observations using Webb's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) show hints of water vapor.If the water vapor is associated with the planet, that would indicate that it has an atmosphere despite its scorching temperature and close proximity to its star. Water vapor has been seen on gaseous exoplanets before, but to date no atmosphere has been definitively detected around a rocky exoplanet. However, the team cautions that the water vapor could be on the star itself\u2014specifically, in cool starspots\u2014and not from the planet at all.      \"We see a signal and it's almost certainly due to water. But we can't tell yet if that water is part of the planet's atmosphere, meaning the planet has an atmosphere, or if we're just seeing a water signature coming from the star,\" said Sarah Moran of the University of Arizona in Tucson, lead author of the study.\"Water vapor in an atmosphere on a hot rocky planet would represent a major breakthrough for exoplanet science. But we must be careful and make sure that the star is not the culprit,\" added Kevin Stevenson of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, principal investigator on the program.GJ 486 b is about 30% larger than the Earth and three times as massive, which means it is a rocky world with stronger gravity than Earth. It orbits a red dwarf star in just under 1.5 Earth days. It is expected to be tidally locked, with a permanent day side and a permanent night side.                This graphic shows the transmission spectrum obtained by Webb observations of rocky exoplanet GJ 486 b. The science team\u2019s analysis shows hints of water vapor; however, computer models show that the signal could be from a water-rich planetary atmosphere (indicated by the blue line) or from starspots from the red dwarf host star (indicated by the yellow line). The two models diverge noticeably at shorter infrared wavelengths, indicating that additional observations with other Webb instruments will be needed to constrain the source of the water signal. The background illustration of a planet is an artist concept. Webb has not taken an image of the planet.. Credit: ILLUSTRATION: NASA, ESA, CSA, Joseph Olmsted (STScI). SCIENCE: Sarah E. Moran (University of Arizona), Kevin B. Stevenson (APL), Ryan MacDonald (University of Michigan), Jacob A. Lustig-Yaeger (APL)             GJ 486 b transits its star, crossing in front of the star from our point of view. If it has an atmosphere, then when it transits starlight would filter through those gasses, imprinting fingerprints in the light that allow astronomers to decode its composition through a technique called transmission spectroscopy.The team observed two transits, each lasting about an hour. They then used three different methods to analyze the resulting data. The results from all three are consistent in that they show a mostly flat spectrum with an intriguing rise at the shortest infrared wavelengths. The team ran computer models considering a number of different molecules, and concluded that the most likely source of the signal was water vapor.While the water vapor could potentially indicate the presence of an atmosphere on GJ 486 b, an equally plausible explanation is water vapor from the star. Surprisingly, even in our own Sun, water vapor can sometimes exist in sunspots because these spots are very cool compared to the surrounding surface of the star. GJ 486 b's host star is much cooler than the Sun, so even more water vapor would concentrate within its starspots. As a result, it could create a signal that mimics a planetary atmosphere.\"We didn't observe evidence of the planet crossing any starspots during the transits. But that doesn't mean that there aren't spots elsewhere on the star. And that's exactly the physical scenario that would imprint this water signal into the data and could wind up looking like a planetary atmosphere,\" explained Ryan MacDonald of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, one of the study's co-authors.A water vapor atmosphere would be expected to gradually erode due to stellar heating and irradiation. As a result, if an atmosphere is present, it would likely have to be constantly replenished by volcanoes ejecting steam from the planet's interior. If the water is indeed in the planet's atmosphere, additional observations are needed to narrow down how much water is present.Future Webb observations may shed more light on this system. An upcoming Webb program will use the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) to observe the planet's day side. If the planet has no atmosphere, or only a thin atmosphere, then the hottest part of the day side is expected to be directly under the star. However, if the hottest point is shifted, that would indicate an atmosphere that can circulate heat.Ultimately, observations at shorter infrared wavelengths by another Webb instrument, the Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS), will be needed to differentiate between the planetary atmosphere and starspot scenarios.\"It's joining multiple instruments together that will really pin down whether or not this planet has an atmosphere,\" said Stevenson.The study is accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

  "answer_race": " Rethinking the Shape of the Milky Way Galaxy",
  "question_squad": " What is the most likely shape of the Milky Way?",
  "answer_squad": " barred spiral",
  "text": "A team of space scientists with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, at both the Purple Mountain Observatory and the National Astronomical Observatories, has found that the traditional view of the Milky Way galaxy as having four arms is not correct. In their paper published in The Astrophysical Journal, the group describes their analysis of multiple sources of data in an attempt to gain a true shape of the Milky Way.          For many years, space scientists have imagined the Milky Way galaxy as a spiral shape with a central bulge and four main spiraling arms\u2014with several other smaller branching arms. Over the past several years, telescope technology has improved and along with it, the realization that the vast majority of galaxies conform to just one of three main shapes: spiral, irregular and elliptical. Also, most have two main arms with spirals splitting into smaller arms.Such splitting is believed to have occurred due to collisions with other galaxies or clusters. Such observations suggest that if the Milky Way is a spiral galaxy with four arms, it would be extraordinarily rare. And if that were the case, there would have to be some unique attributes that would have led to such a unique shape. The researchers with this new effort suggest it is more likely that we got the shape wrong from the start. They believe that, like most other galaxies, the Milky Way has just two main arms.The research team came to this conclusion by analyzing data from a new generation of space instruments, all of which have technology that allows for measuring how far individual stars are away from us. One such instrument, the team notes, has long baseline interferometry, which can very accurately measure the distances to stars that emit microwaves. They used it to measure 200 such stars which they used to start building a map of the Milky Way.The team also used data from the Gaia space observatory, which is used to map the location of stars in relation to Earth and one another. They focused their attention on O-B stars, which have been found to be useful because they do not move much after formation. They gathered data on 24,000 of them and added them to the map they were building. They also added data for nearly a thousand open cluster stars, also courtesy of Gaia.The team then fit the arrangement of the stars to a spiral and, in so doing, found that that the most likely shape of the Milky Way is a barred spiral with two main arms that stretch outwards from the bar. Other shorter arms are more distant and irregular and are not connected to the main structure. More information:Y. Xu et al, What Does the Milky Way Look Like?, The Astrophysical Journal (2023).

  "text": "Using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), an international team of astronomers has discovered two \"super-Earth\" exoplanets orbiting a nearby M-dwarf star known as TOI-2095. The newfound alien worlds have short orbital periods and are slightly larger than the Earth. The findings were presented April 18 on the arXiv pre-print server.          TESS is conducting a survey of about 200,000 of the brightest stars near the sun with the aim of searching for transiting exoplanets, ranging from small rocky worlds to gaseous giants. So far, it has identified 6,400 candidate exoplanets (TESS Objects of Interest, or TOI), of which 330 have been confirmed to date.Now, a team of astronomers led by Felipe Murgas of the University of La Laguna, Spain, reported that two more candidate extrasolar planets monitored with TESS have been confirmed. By conducting photometric observations and radial velocity measurements, they found that transit signals in the light curve of TOI-2095 are of planetary nature.\"We report the validation of two transiting planets around the M dwarf TOI-2095 discovered by TESS. We use ground-based high-resolution imaging, TESS photometric data, and CARMENES radial velocities to discard false positive scenarios, measure the planetary radii, and place stringent upper limits on the masses of the transiting candidates,\" the researchers explained.The exoplanet nearer to the star, approximately 0.1 AU from it, received designation TOI-2095 b. According to the study, the planet is about 25% larger than the Earth and has an orbital period of 17.66 days. The equilibrium temperature of TOI-2095 b was found to be 347 K, while its mass is estimated to be not greater than 4.1 Earth masses.The second planet in the system, TOI-2095 c, has a radius of about 1.33 Earth radii and orbits its host every 28.17 days, at a distance of some 0.137 AU from it. TOI-2095 c has an equilibrium temperature of approximately 297 K and its maximum mass was calculated to be 7.4 Earth masses.The parent star TOI-2095 is about 56% smaller and less massive than the sun. It has a spectral type M2.5 V, effective temperature of 3,759 K, and metallicity at a level of -0.24. The age of the star is estimated to be at least one billion years.Summing up the results, the authors of the paper noted that the two newly discovered exoplanets are close to the inner edge of the habitable zone of TOI-2095 and that their parameters make them attractive targets for further follow-up observations.\"In particular, extremely precise radial velocity follow-up observations can help to improve the mass measurements (and hence the bulk densities) of the planets and provide some constraints for future prospects for atmospheric characterization,\" the researchers wrote.

  "text": "In May 2022, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) team released the first-ever radio image of M87's central black hole. It was a stunning revelation based on observations made using a worldwide array of radio telescopes. Recently, they re-released a newer, sharper image of the black hole's \"ring of light.\"          Now, a team of astronomers from Europe, Korea, and China, have taken things a step further. This week, they released another amazing view of this monster, this time, in a slightly different range of radio emissions. It clearly shows the connection between the supermassive black hole, its light ring, and the famous high-speed jet.This latest image was made using an extensive array of radio telescopes. They comprised the Global mm Very Large Baseline Array (GMVA), the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), and the Greenland Telescope (GLT). Their combined observations showed very small details in the region around the galactic core. It's the first time all three major parts of the object are in the same image.The observations, taken in 2018, show the region in radio light emitted at a longer wavelength than the EHT image. It's at 3.5 mm instead of 1.3 mm. \"At this wavelength, we can see how the jet emerges from the ring of emission around the central supermassive black hole,\" says Thomas Krichbaum of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy. The material streaming away from M87 is an astrophysical jet. It contains superheated (ionized) matter flowing out at high speed along an axis of rotation.Getting the big picture of the black holeTo understand the structures in the latest image, we need to know more about them. We know that supermassive black holes in the cores of galaxies are tremendously strong gravitational wells. Nothing can escape because they pretty much suck in everything in the neighborhood. The formation of these monsters is still not well understood. But, we can observe what they do to their neighborhoods.In the case of M87, there's an accretion disk funneling material into the black hole. On the other hand, the jet helps some materials to escape. Understanding how such an enormous jet can get created is a longstanding problem in astronomy. It probably forms as a result of some kind of activity inside the surrounding accretion disk.The jet formation likely also involves tangled magnetic fields. However, astronomers are still unclear on all the details. \"We know that jets are ejected from the region surrounding black holes,\" said Ru-Sen Lu from the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory in China, \"but we still do not fully understand how this actually happens. To study this directly we need to observe the origin of the jet as close as possible to the black hole.\"The new image also shows how the base of the jet connects with the disk of matter swirling into the black hole. Previous observations showed separate views of that disk and the jet. So, this is the first time both features have been observed together. \"This new image completes the picture by showing the region around the black hole and the jet at the same time,\" said team member Jae-Young Kim from the Kyungpook National University in South Korea and the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Germany.                Messier 87 (M87) is an enormous elliptical galaxy located about 55 million light-years from Earth, visible in the constellation Virgo. M87 has a supermassive black hole at its center, plus a relativistic jet of matter being ejected at nearly the speed of light. Credit: ESO             Probing the ringThe ring of light surrounding M87's supermassive black hole is another fascinating part of the study. It's actually something of an optical illusion. As matter orbits around, it gets heated by friction with other matter, and by interactions with the magnetic fields. That causes it to emit light. The strong gravitational effect of the black hole bends and captures some of the light. That creates what looks like a ring. We can see it in the EHT image of M87's black hole.The new observations of the ring were made in 2018 and are now being released along with a paper (below) discussing the science. The size of the ring observed by the GMVA network is roughly 50% larger in comparison to the EHT image. \"To understand the physical origin of the bigger and thicker ring, we had to use computer simulations to test different scenarios,\" explained Keiichi Asada from the Academia Sinica in Taiwan. The results suggest the new image reveals more of the material that is falling toward the black hole than what could be observed with the EHT.                The new PRIMO reconstruction of the black hole in M87 is in the center. The original radio image from EHT is at left. This is based on a newly \u201ccleaned-up\u201d image from the Event Horizon Telescope. Credit: Lia Medeiros et al. / ApJL, 2023             More observations planned for M87's black holeThis new observation of the jet and the black hole is the first next-generation view of the system. Future studies will continue with networks of radio telescopes ganged together. They'll continue probing the connection between black holes and their jets. \"We plan to observe the region around the black hole at the center of M87 at different radio wavelengths to further study the emission of the jet,\" noted Eduardo Ros from the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy.Simultaneous observations using this array and the EHT would allow the team to disentangle all the complex actions that occur near the supermassive black hole. Not only will they be interested in the jet, but also the physics and activities of the accretion disk where the jet launches. \"The coming years will be exciting, as we will be able to learn more about what happens near one of the most mysterious regions in the universe,\" said Ros.

  "text": "Water may be more widespread and recent on Mars than previously thought, based on observations of Martian sand dunes by China's rover.          The finding highlights new, potentially fertile areas in the warmer regions of Mars where conditions might be suitable for life to exist, though more study is needed.Friday's news comes days after mission leaders acknowledged that the Zhurong rover has yet to wake up since going into hibernation for the Martian winter nearly a year ago.Its solar panels are likely covered with dust, choking off its power source and possibly preventing the rover from operating again, said Zhang Rongqiao, the mission's chief designer.Before Zhurong fell silent, it observed salt-rich dunes with cracks and crusts, which researchers said likely were mixed with melting morning frost or snow as recently as a few hundred thousand years ago.Their estimated date range for when the cracks and other dune features formed in Mars' Utopia Planitia, a vast plain in the northern hemisphere: sometime after 1.4 million to 400,000 years ago or even younger.Conditions during that period were similar to now on Mars, with rivers and lakes dried up and no longer flowing as they did billions of years earlier.Studying the structure and chemical makeup of these dunes can provide insights into \"the possibility of water activity\" during this period, the Beijing-based team wrote in a study published in Science Advances.\"We think it could be a small amount ... no more than a film of water on the surface,\" co-author Xiaoguang Qin of the Institute of Geology and Geophysics said in an email.The rover did not directly detect any water in the form of frost or ice. But Qin said computer simulations and observations by other spacecraft at Mars indicate that even nowadays at certain times of year, conditions could be suitable for water to appear.                In this April 30, 2021, file image taken by the Mars Perseverance rover and made available by NASA, the Mars Ingenuity helicopter, right, flies over the surface of the planet. A new study suggests water on Mars may be more widespread and recent than previously thought. Scientists reported the finding from China's Mars rover in Science Advances on Friday, April 28, 2023. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU/MSSS via AP, File             What's notable about the study is how young the dunes are, said planetary scientist Frederic Schmidt at the University of Paris-Saclay, who was not part of the study.      \"This is clearly a new piece of science for this region,\" he said in an email.Small pockets of water from thawing frost or snow, mixed with salt, likely resulted in the small cracks, hard crusty surfaces, loose particles and other dune features like depressions and ridges, the Chinese scientists said. They ruled out wind as a cause, as well as frost made of carbon dioxide, which makes up the bulk of Mars' atmosphere.Martian frost has been observed since NASA's 1970s Viking missions, but these light dustings of morning frost were thought to occur in certain locations under specific conditions.The rover has now provided \"evidence that there may be a wider distribution of this process on Mars than previously identified,\" said Trinity College Dublin's Mary Bourke, an expert in Mars geology.However small this watery niche, it could be important for identifying habitable environments, she added.Launched in 2020, the six-wheeled Zhurong\u2014named after a fire god in Chinese mythology\u2014arrived at Mars in 2021 and spent a year roaming around before going into hibernation last May. The rover operated longer than intended, traveling more than a mile (1,921 meters).

  "text": "The Zhurong rover has found evidence of water on dune surfaces on modern Mars by providing key observational proof of liquid water at low Martian latitudes, according to a study led by Prof. Qin Xiaoguang from the Institute of Geology and Geophysics (IGG) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).          Researchers from the National Astronomical Observatories of CAS and the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of CAS were also involved in the study. The study was published in Science Advances on April 28.Previous studies have provided proof of a large amount of liquid water on early Mars, but with the escape of the early Martian atmosphere during the later period, the climate changed dramatically. Very low pressure and water vapor content make it difficult for liquid water to sustainably exist on Mars today. Thus, it has been widely believed that water can only exist there in solid or gaseous forms.Nonetheless, droplets observed on the Phoenix's robotic arm prove that salty liquid water can appear in the summer at current high latitudes on Mars. Numerical simulations have also shown that climatic conditions suitable for liquid water can briefly occur in certain areas of Mars today. Until now, though, no evidence has shown the presence of liquid water at low latitudes on Mars.Now, however, findings from the Zhurong rover fill the gap. The Zhurong rover, which is part of China's Tianwen-1 Mars exploration mission, successfully landed on Mars on May 15, 2021. The landing site is located at the southern edge of the Utopia Planitia (UP) Plain (109.925 E, 25.066 N), where the northern lowlands unit is located.The researchers used data obtained by the Navigation and Terrain Camera (NaTeCam), the Multispectral Camera (MSCam), and the Mars Surface Composition Detector (MarSCoDe) aboard the Zhurong rover to study the different-scale surface features and material compositions of dunes in the landing area.They found some important morphological features on the dune surfaces, such as crusts, cracks, granulation, polygonal ridges, and a strip-like trace. The analysis of spectral data revealed that the dune surficial layer is rich in hydrated sulfates, hydrated silica (especially opal-CT), trivalent iron oxide minerals (especially ferrihydrite), and possibly chlorides.\"According to the measured meteorological data by Zhurong and other Mars rovers, we inferred that these dune surface characteristics were related to the involvement of liquid saline water formed by the subsequent melting of frost/snow falling on the salt-containing dune surfaces when cooling occurs,\" said Prof. Qin.Specifically, salts in dunes cause frost/snow to melt at low temperatures to form salty liquid water. When the saline water dries, the precipitated hydrated sulfate, opal, iron oxide, and other hydrated minerals cement sand particles to form sand aggregates and even crust. Then the crust is further cracked by shrinkage. The later frost/snow melting process further forms polygonal ridges and a strip-like trace on the crust surface.The estimated age of the dunes (about 0.4\u20131.4 million years) and the relationship among the three phases of water suggest that the transfer of water vapor from the polar ice sheet toward the equator during the large obliquity stages of Mars's late Amazonian period led to repeated humid environments at low latitudes. Therefore, a scenario of water activity has been proposed, i.e., cooling at low latitudes during Mars's large obliquity stages prompts frost/snow to fall and subsequently results in the formation of crusts and aggregates on the salty dune surface, thus solidifying dunes and leaving traces of liquid saline water activity.The discovery provides key observational evidence of liquid water at Martian low latitudes, where surface temperatures are relatively warmer and more suitable for life than at high latitudes.\"This is important for understanding the evolutionary history of the Martian climate, looking for a habitable environment, and providing key clues for the future search for life,\" said Prof. Qin.

  "question_squad": " What is the only way the sun can affect gravitational waves?",
  "answer_squad": " through its gravitational mass",
  "text": "Gravitational wave astronomy is still in its early stages. So far it has focused on the most energetic and distinct sources of gravitational waves, such as the cataclysmic mergers of black holes and neutron stars. But that will change as our gravitational telescopes improve, and it will allow astronomers to explore the universe in ways previously impossible.          Although gravitational waves have many similarities to light waves, one distinct difference is that most objects are transparent to gravitational waves. Light can be absorbed, scattered, and blocked by matter, but gravitational waves mostly just pass through matter. They can be lensed by the mass of an object, but not fully blocked. This means that gravitational waves could be used as a tool to peer inside astronomical bodies, similar to the way X-rays or MRIs allow us to see inside a human's body.This is the idea behind a recent study looking at how gravitational waves could be used to probe the sun's interior. The sun is so incredibly hot and dense that light can't penetrate it. Even light produced in the sun's core takes more than 100,000 years to reach the sun's surface. Our only information about the sun's interior comes from helioseismology, where astronomers study vibrations of the sun's surface caused by sound waves within the sun.In this new study, now published on the arXiv preprint server, the team looks at how the gravitational waves of fast-rotating neutron stars could be used to study the sun. Although a perfectly smooth rotating object doesn't create gravitational waves, asymmetrical spinning objects do. Neutron stars can have deformations or mountainous rises caused by their interior heat or magnetic fields. If such a neutron star spins rapidly, it produces a continuous stream of gravitational waves. These gravitational waves are too faint to be observed by current telescopes, but the next generation of gravitational observatories should be able to detect them.Since neutron stars are quite common in the galaxy, some of them are positioned such that the sun passes in front of them from our perspective. Of the more than 3,000 known pulsars, about 500 of them are good candidates for gravitational wave sources, and of those three of them are known to pass behind the sun. The team used the profiles of these three pulsars as a starting point.Since the sun is transparent to gravitational waves, the only effect the sun has on them is through its gravitational mass. As the waves pass through the sun, they are gravitationally lensed a bit. The amount of lensing depends on the mass of the sun and the distribution of that mass. The team found that with proper measurements, gravitational wave observations could measure the density profile of the sun with an accuracy of 3 sigma.The three known pulsars are likely just a tiny fraction of the gravitational wave sources that pass behind the sun. Most neutron stars have a spin orientation that doesn't direct radio flashes in our direction, but they could still be used as gravitational probes. There are likely hundreds of fast-rotating neutron stars that pass behind the sun over the course of a year. So as we are able to observe their gravitational waves, they should give us an excellent view inside our closest star.

  "text": "A team of Japanese astronomers used simultaneous ground-based and space-based observations to capture a more complete picture of a superflare on a star. The observed flare started with a very massive, high-velocity prominence eruption. These results give us a better idea of how superflares and stellar prominence eruptions occur.          Some stars have been seen releasing superflares more than 10 times larger than the largest solar flare ever seen on the sun. The hot ionized gas released by solar flares can influence the environment around the Earth, referred to as space weather. More powerful superflares must have an even greater impact on the evolution of any planets forming around the star, or the evolution of any life forming on those planets. But the details of how superflares and prominence eruptions on stars occur have been unclear.A team led by Shun Inoue at Kyoto University used the 3.8-m Seimei Telescope in Japan and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to monitor the binary star system V1355 Orionis which is known to frequently release large-scale superflares. V1355 Orionis is located 400 light years away in the constellation Orion.The team succeeded in capturing a superflare with continuous, high temporal resolution observations. Data analysis shows that the superflare originated with a phenomenon known as a prominence eruption. Calculating the velocity of the eruption requires making some assumptions about aspects that aren't directly observably, but even the most conservative estimates far exceed the escape velocity of the star (347 km/s), indicating that the prominence eruption was capable of breaking free of the star's gravity and developing into Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs).

  "answer_squad": " Quaoar",
  "text": "A large international team of astronomers has discovered that the dwarf planet Quaoar is circled by a second ring. In their study, accepted for publication in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, the group discovered the second ring while they were studying the first known ring.          Quaoar is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt. It was discovered by astronomers Michael Brown and Chad Trujillo in 2002. Since that time, studies have shown it to be approximately 1,110 km in diameter, which is approximately half the size of Pluto. Researchers have also found that it has water ice on its surface and has signs of cryovolcanism. It also has a small moon named Weywot. Both the planet and its moon were named after Native American mythological figures.In February of this year, a ring was discovered around Quaoar, which called into question theories regarding how ring systems and moons form. In this new effort, the research team found a second ring.Both rings lie beyond the Roche limit, which contradicts theories that describe how moons and rings form. Previously, researchers believed that material within the Roche limit should be pulled apart by tidal forces, meaning a ring should form. Material outside of the Roche limit, theory suggests, should coalesce, forming a moon. Why this it not the case with Quaoar is unknown and has led some to begin questioning such theories. Others suggest the rings could have formed due to the location of Weywot.Neither of the two rings is visible using an ordinary telescope; both were found indirectly when Quaoar happened to pass over light from distant stars behind it. Dimming of the starlight in a certain way revealed the presence of a single ring last February. When another occultation occurred more recently, scientists were ready and pointed their equipment at the planet and its newly found ring. They were able to learn more about both\u2014they found, for example, that the ring has a dense core that is just a few miles wide. They plan to study the second ring during future occultations.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the galaxy that was found to be the closest to a TDE?",
  "answer_squad": " NGC 7392",
  "text": "Once every 10,000 years or so, the center of a galaxy lights up as its supermassive black hole rips apart a passing star. This \"tidal disruption event\" happens in a literal flash, as the central black hole pulls in stellar material and blasts out huge amounts of radiation in the process.          Astronomers know of around 100 tidal disruption events (TDE) in distant galaxies, based on the burst of light that arrives at telescopes on Earth and in space. Most of this light comes from X-rays and optical radiation.MIT astronomers, tuning past the conventional X-ray and UV/optical bands, have discovered a new tidal disruption event, shining brightly in infrared. It is one of the first times scientists have directly identified a TDE at infrared wavelengths.What's more, the new outburst happens to be the closest tidal disruption event observed to date: The flare was found in NGC 7392, a galaxy that is about 137 million light-years from Earth, which corresponds to a region in our cosmic backyard that is one-fourth the size of the next-closest TDE.This new flare, labeled WTP14adbjsh, did not stand out in standard X-ray and optical data. The scientists suspect that these traditional surveys missed the nearby TDE, not because it did not emit X-rays and UV light, but because that light was obscured by an enormous amount of dust that absorbed the radiation and gave off heat in the form of infrared energy.The researchers determined that WTP14adbjsh occurred in a young, star-forming galaxy, in contrast to the majority of TDEs that have been found in quieter galaxies. Scientists expected that star-forming galaxies should host TDEs, as the stars they churn out would provide plenty of fuel for a galaxy's central black hole to devour. But observations of TDEs in star-forming galaxies were rare until now.The new study suggests that conventional X-ray and optical surveys may have missed TDEs in star-forming galaxies because these galaxies naturally produce more dust that could obscure any light coming from their core. Searching in the infrared band could reveal many more, previously hidden TDEs in active, star-forming galaxies.\"Finding this nearby TDE means that, statistically, there must be a large population of these events that traditional methods were blind to,\" says Christos Panagiotou, a postdoc in MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. \"So, we should try to find these in infrared if we want a complete picture of black holes and their host galaxies.\"A paper detailing the team's discovery appears today in Astrophysical Journal Letters. Panagiotou's MIT co-authors are Kishalay De, Megan Masterson, Erin Kara, Michael Calzadilla, Anna-Christina Eilers, Danielle Frostig, Nathan Lourie, and Rob Simcoe, along with Viraj Karambelkar, Mansi Kasliwal, Robert Stein, and Jeffry Zolkower of Caltech, and Aaron Meisner at the National Science Foundation's National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory.      A flash of possibilityPanagiotou did not intend to search for tidal disruption events. He and his colleagues were looking for signs of general transient sources in observational data, using a search tool developed by De. The team used De's method to look for potential transient events in archival data taken by NASA's NEOWISE mission, a space telescope that has made regular scans of the entire sky since 2010, at  infrared wavelengths.The team discovered a bright flash that appeared in the sky near the end of 2014.\"We could see there was nothing at first,\" Panagiotou recalls. \"Then suddenly, in late 2014, the source got brighter and by 2015 reached a high luminosity, then started going back to its previous quiescence.\"They traced the flash to a galaxy 42 megarparsecs from Earth. The question then was, what set it off? To answer this, the team considered the brightness and timing of the flash, comparing the actual observations with models of various astrophysical processes that could produce a similar flash.\"For instance, supernovae are sources that explode and brighten suddenly, then come back down, on similar timescales to tidal disruption events,\" Panagiotou notes. \"But supernovae are not as luminous and energetic as what we observed.\"Working through different possibilities of what the burst could be, the scientists were finally able to exclude all but one: The flash was most likely a TDE, and the closest one observed so far.\"It's a very clean light curve and really follows what we expect the temporal evolution of a TDE should be,\" Panagiotou says.Red or greenFrom there, the researchers took a closer look at the galaxy where the TDE arose. They gathered data from multiple ground- and space-based telescopes which happened to observe the part of the sky where the galaxy resides, across various wavelengths, including infrared, optical, and X-ray bands. With this accumulated data, the team estimated that the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy was about 30 million times as massive as the sun.\"This is almost 10 times larger than the black hole we have at our galactic center, so it's quite massive, though black holes can get up to 10 billion solar masses,\" Panagiotou says.The team also found that the galaxy itself is actively producing new stars. Star-forming galaxies are a class of \"blue\" galaxies, in contrast to quieter \"red\" galaxies that have stopped producing new stars. Star-forming blue galaxies are the most common type of galaxy in the universe.\"Green\" galaxies lie somewhere between red and blue, in that, every so often they produce a few stars. Green is the least common galaxy type, but curiously, most TDEs detected to date have been traced to these rarer galaxies. Scientists had struggled to explain these detections, since theory predicts that blue star-forming galaxies should exhibit TDEs, as they would present more stars for black holes to disrupt.But star-forming galaxies also produce a lot of dust from the interactions between and among stars near a galaxy's core. This dust is detectable at infrared wavelengths, but it can obscure any X-ray or UV radiation that would otherwise be picked up by optical telescopes. This could explain why astronomers have not detected TDEs in star-forming galaxies using conventional optical methods.\"The fact that optical and X-ray surveys missed this luminous TDE in our own backyard is very illuminating, and demonstrates that these surveys are only giving us a partial census of the total population of TDEs,\" says Suvi Gezari, associate astronomer and chair of the Science Staff at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Maryland, who was not involved in the study.  \"Using infrared surveys to catch the dust echo of obscured TDEs\u2026has already shown us that there is a population of TDEs in dusty, star-forming galaxies that we have been missing.\" More information:Christos Panagiotou et al, A Luminous Dust-obscured Tidal Disruption Event Candidate in a Star-forming Galaxy at 42 Mpc, The Astrophysical Journal Letters (2023).

  "text": "The Fluidic Telescope (FLUTE) project team, jointly led by NASA and Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, envisions a way to make huge circular self-healing mirrors in-orbit to further the field of astronomy. Larger telescopes collect more light, and they allow astronomers to peer farther into space and see distant objects in greater detail.          These next-generation large space observatories would study the highest priority astrophysics targets, including first generation stars\u2014the first to shine and flame out after the Big Bang\u2014early galaxies, and Earth-like exoplanets. These observatories could help address one of humanity's most important science questions: \"Are we alone in the universe?\"Like a carry-on suitcase, payloads launching to space need to stay within allowable size and weight limits to fly. Already pushing size limits, the state-of-the-art 21 foot (6.5 meter) aperture James Webb Space Telescope needed to be folded up origami-style\u2014including the mirror itself\u2014to fit inside the rocket for its ride to space. The aperture of an optical space observatory refers to the size of the telescope's primary mirror, the surface that collects and focuses incoming light.The aperture for the space observatory envisioned by FLUTE researchers under the current concept would be approximately 164 feet (50 meters) in diameter\u2014half as long as a football field.Conventional technology for making optical components for telescopes is literally a grind. It involves an iterative process of sanding and polishing solid materials, such as glass or metal, to shape the precise curved surfaces of lenses and mirrors needed. Using current technologies, scaling up space telescopes to apertures larger than approximately 33 feet (10 meters) in diameter does not appear economically viable.FLUTE's novel cost-effective technology approach, in contrast, takes advantage of the way fluids naturally behave in microgravity.All liquids have an elastic-like force that holds them together at their surface. This force is called surface tension. It's what allows some insects to glide across water without sinking and gives water droplets their shape.                Eytan Stibbe aboard the International Space Station during the Axiom-1 (AX-1) mission in April 2022, shown here with his hands in the life sciences glovebox, or LSG, performing the Fluidic Space Optics experiment of Technion and NASA. During the experiment, Stibbe injected liquid polymers into circular frames to form lenses. He subsequently processed the lenses to harden them for later study on Earth. Credit: Axiom/NASA/Technion             On Earth, when droplets of water are small enough\u20140.08 inches (2 millimeters) or smaller\u2014surface tension overcomes gravity, and they remain perfectly spherical, much like droplets of morning dew beading into tiny spheres on plant leaves. If a droplet grows much larger, it gets squished under its own weight. But in space, where fluids are free-floating, unhindered by gravity, even large amounts of liquids assume the most energy efficient shape possible, a perfect sphere.      Liquids can cling to surfaces due to a physical property called adhesion. In microgravity, if a sufficient amount of liquid is made to adhere to the interior surface of a circular, ring-like frame, the liquid will stretch across the inside of the frame and naturally form a curved shape\u2014called a spherical section\u2014thanks to surface tension.By using the right volume of liquid, it is possible to make the surface of the liquid curve inward instead of bulging outward. If the liquid is reflective, that inwardly curved surface can serve as a telescope mirror.FLUTE would launch liquids to space as the raw material to make optical components in orbit. The primary mirror would form within a huge circular frame and remain in liquid state with an extremely smooth surface for collecting light. FLUTE's technology approach is theoretically able to scale up to very large sizes. The technology could potentially enable telescopes with apertures measuring 10 times\u2014or even 100 times\u2014larger than telescopes to-date.A unique feature of the liquid mirror would be its ability to self-repair if damaged in space. For instance, if a micrometeorite impacts the mirror's surface, it would naturally heal itself within a short period of time.The FLUTE team has conducted small-scale experiments in shaping lenses from liquids in different environments: First using neutral buoyancy space analog conditions in a ground laboratory and then in a series of parabolic microgravity flights and aboard the International Space Station.With the support of a NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) Phase I award, the team is working to analyze options for the key components of a fluid telescope observatory, further develop the mission concept, and create an initial plan for a subscale small spacecraft demonstration in low-Earth orbit.Milestones:December 2021: The FLUTE team conducted parabolic flight tests aboard Zero Gravity Corporation's G-FORCE ONE, a modified airplane that provides brief periods of microgravity to enable technology evaluation. The experiment tested the formation of free-standing liquid lenses from synthetic oils of different viscosities.April 2022: Axiom-1 astronaut Eytan Stibbe conducted a microgravity experiment aboard the space station. The experiment used liquid polymers to form lenses that were hardened in orbit and returned to Earth for analysis. An additional, educational experiment was also performed, during which a large lens\u2014which remained in its liquid state\u2014was formed using regular water.November 2022: The FLUTE team conducted parabolic flight tests aboard Zero Gravity Corporation's G-FORCE ONE. This set of experiments focused on creating liquid mirrors rather than lenses, which was done using ionic liquids and an alloy of gallium. Gallium is a non-toxic, highly reflective metal that has a very low melting temperature. Pure gallium melts at approximately 85 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning you can melt a piece of gallium by just holding it in your hand.January 2023: FLUTE was selected by NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program for a Phase I study.Provided byNASACitation:What is the Fluidic Telescope?

  "text": "Researchers led by Dr. Xin Liping from the Space-based Multi-band Astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) research team, National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC), have detected the prompt optical emission and its transition to the early afterglow of a gamma-ray burst (GRB 201223A), using the Ground Wide Angle Camera Array (GWAC) located at Xinglong Observatory of NAOC. The study was published in Nature Astronomy on April 10.          Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are produced by the collapse of massive stars or the merger of binary neutron stars. They are accompanied by extreme relativistic jets emitting enormous amounts of energy within a few seconds of the bursts. This phenomenon includes the prompt emission caused by the shock in the jet and the afterglow produced by interaction between the jet and external medium.Typical high-energy emission lasts only a few milliseconds to tens of seconds, and it is difficult to follow up in real time when ground-based optical telescopes receive alerts triggered by space-based high-energy instruments. Until now, only a few cases of optical emission have been detected before the end of prompt high-energy emission. These GRBs have longer duration of high-energy emission (>30 seconds). Furthermore, all these measurements were contaminated with reverse shock, making it difficult to clearly review the transition from prompt emission to afterglow.GWAC, proposed and led by Prof. Wei Jianyan, principal investigator of the SVOM mission, is one of the key ground-based telescopes for the SVOM project. It can cover an ultra-large sky area with a temporal resolution of 15 seconds and a detection capability of magnitude 16. Its scientific purpose is to conduct systematic research on the prompt optical emission of GRBs discovered by the SVOM mission.                The optical, X-ray and gamma-ray light curves of GRB 201223A. The red data in the upper panel was obtained by GWAC and F60A. Credit: NAOC             In this study, GWAC recorded the entire process\u2014before, during and after the trigger time of the burst. The duration of the high-energy emission was 29 seconds. The emergence of optical and gamma-ray emissions was detected simultaneously.\"The prompt optical emission is far brighter than expected by about four orders of magnitude, if only gamma-ray emission is analyzed, which requires a special physical interpretation for these measurements,\" said by Dr. Xin.According to joint analysis using the follow-up observations by F60A, an optical telescope jointly operated by NAOC and Guangxi University, the complete transition from prompt optical emission to afterglow was clearly achieved without any contamination from reverse shock.                Spectral energy distribution of GRB201223A. The data from GWAC in red is higher than the value extrapolated from the best model for gamma-ray emission by about four orders of magnitude. Credit: NAOC             The extremely early unique data provided by GWAC place a fine constraint on the characteristics of the progenitor. Scientists expect strong stellar winds around a massive star, which is thought to be the ideal progenitor of a gamma-ray burst. However, the stellar wind is quite small for this event, even at a very close distance from the burst, thus suggesting the progenitor has a small stellar mass.After the launch of SVOM, simultaneous observations by GWAC and SVOM space-based instruments will have the potential to provide essential data for GRB studies, and finally a large sample with prompt optical observations will be built during the SVOM mission.

  "text": "The search for radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations has yet to yield evidence of alien technological activity. Research carried out at EPFL suggests we continue searching while optimizing the use of available resources.          For over sixty years, amateur and professional astronomers have been monitoring the sky in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). So far, to no avail. But how should we read the absence of alien radio signals? Is it time we stop looking? Or should we double down and look harder, peering ever deeper into our galaxy? A recent statistical analysis of the sixty-year silence suggests a simple, optimistic explanation and urges the SETI community to continue searching, but to stay patient, as the chances for detecting signals in the coming sixty years are slim.The prevailing explanations for the absence of electromagnetic signals from extraterrestrial societies fall into two extreme categories, says Claudio Grimaldi from EPFL's Laboratory of Statistical Biophysics. The \"optimistic\" camp holds that we've been using detectors that are not sensitive enough or missed incoming signals because we've been pointing our radio telescopes in the wrong direction. The \"pessimistic\" camp, on the other hand, interprets the silence as indicating the absence of alien life in our galaxy.According to Grimaldi's study, published in The Astronomical Journal, there's a third explanation. \"We've only been looking for 60 years. Earth could simply be in a bubble that just happens to be devoid of radio waves emitted by extraterrestrial life,\" he says.Modeling the Milky Way as a spongeGrimaldi's study builds on a statistical model initially developed to model porous materials such as sponges, which he sees as a fitting analogy for the question at hand: \"You can imagine the sponge's solid matter to represent electromagnetic signals radiating spherically from a planet harboring extraterrestrial life into space.\" In this analogy, the sponge's holes\u2014its pores\u2014would represent regions where signals are absent.By repurposing mathematical tools to study porous materials and using Bayesian statistics, Grimaldi was able to draw quantitative conclusions from the sixty years of observed silence. His findings are conditional on the assumptions that there is at least one electromagnetic signal of technological origin in the galaxy at any given time and that Earth has been in a silent bubble, or a \"pore,\" for at least 60 years.\"If it is true that we've been in a void region for sixty years, our model suggests that there are less than one to five electromagnetic emissions per century anywhere in our galaxy. This would make them about as rare as supernovas in the Milky Way,\" says Grimaldi. In the most optimistic scenario, we would have to wait more than 60 years for one of these signals to reach our planet. In the least optimistic scenario, that number would go up to around 2,000 years. Whether we detect the signals when they cross our path is another question. In either case, our radio telescopes would have to be pointed in the right direction to see them.      Defining best practices to continue searchingThe search for extraterrestrial intelligence currently has the wind in its sails, buoyed by the discovery, around 20 years ago, of the first planets beyond our solar system. Today, researchers assume there could be as many as 10 billion Earth-like planets\u2014rocky, the right size, and located at the right distance from the sun to harbor life. Their sheer number increases the likelihood that technological life may have developed on one of them.This has led to new initiatives across the SETI community. The privately funded \"Breakthrough Listen\" project, the largest of its kind, has put close to 100 million dollars towards dedicating radio telescope time to search for techno-signals from extraterrestrial civilizations. With the initiative ending in two years, Grimaldi says that it's a good time to think about how to pursue the search for extraterrestrial intelligence in the future.\"The dream of the SETI community is to look for signals all the time, across the entire sky. Even today's largest telescopes can only see a small fraction of the sky. Today, there are telescope arrays, such as the Allen Telescope Array (ATA) in California, that point in different directions and can be directed at specific regions to get more detailed information when necessary. The same is true for optical telescopes.\"\"But,\" says Grimaldi, \"the truth is, we don't know where to search, at which frequencies and wavelengths. We are currently looking at other phenomena using our telescopes, so the best strategy might be to adopt the SETI community's past approach of using data from other astrophysical studies\u2014detecting radio emissions from other stars or galaxies\u2014to see if they contain any techno-signals, and make that the standard practice.\"Ineffective or just unlucky?Asked whether he considers his conclusions encouraging or discouraging, Grimaldi laughed and said, \"This is something we need to think about. We may have been unlucky in that we discovered how to use radio telescopes just as we were crossing a portion of space in which electromagnetic signals from other civilizations were absent. To me, this hypothesis seems less extreme than assuming that we are constantly bombarded by signals from all sides but are, for some reason, unable to detect them.\" More information:Claudio Grimaldi, Inferring the Rate of Technosignatures from 60 yr of Nondetection, The Astronomical Journal (2023).

  "text": "When one thinks of the damage that climate change is doing, it's probable that what comes to mind is a vision of huge lumps of ice dropping off one of the polar ice sheets and crashing into the ocean. While Greenland and Antarctica are losing masses of ice, so too are most of the glaciers around the world, but it's tricky to measure how much ice they are shedding.          Thanks to ESA's CryoSat satellite and a breakthrough way of using its data, scientists have discovered that glaciers worldwide have shrunk by a total of 2% in just 10 years, and it's because of higher air temperatures.A paper, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, describes how scientists have used a particular technique of processing CryoSat data to reveal that glaciers lost a whopping 2,720 gigatons of ice between 2010 and 2020.Their research also demonstrates that higher air temperatures are responsible for 89% of this ice loss.Glaciers are found on all continents except Australia. They provide an essential source of freshwater. For example, glaciers in high-mountain Asia alone provide water for over 1.3 billion people. Glaciers are also important for industries such as hydropower.The demise of glaciers around the world is, therefore, set to cause serious problems for local populations and those relying on outflow water further downstream.In addition, ice being lost from glaciers is contributing more to sea-level rise than the ice being lost from either of the giant ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica.Despite mountain glaciers being key indicators of climate change and being important to society, estimates of global glacier mass loss have remained limited to a few scientific studies. This is because there are numerous practical challenges in mapping and monitoring glaciers, which tend to lie in complex rugged terrain, and because there isn't a specific satellite mission dedicated to do this.Noel Gourmelen, from the University of Edinburgh in the U.K., said, \"I'm sure most people have seen photographs taken at different times that show how a glacier terminus has retreated over time. And we can see this from satellite images too.\"But we need to measure how a glacier's volume is changing to really make sense of what is happening.\"Thanks to ESA\u2019s CryoSat satellite and a breakthrough way of using its data, scientists have discovered that glaciers worldwide have shrunk by a total of 2% in just 10 years, and it\u2019s because of higher air temperatures. Credit: ESA/Planetary VisionsThe research team turned to ESA's CryoSat satellite, which carries a radar altimeter to measure the height of ice surfaces. This works well for measuring sea level and the height of sea ice, which is used to work out how ice thickness changes, and for measuring vast polar ice sheets.      However, the footprint of this type of instrument is too coarse to measure and monitor mountain glaciers.\"Some years ago, we developed a technique of processing CryoSat data, called swath processing, which has revolutionized the use of CryoSat data over complex icy terrains. It unveils a wealth of new detail on glaciers,\" noted Dr. Gourmelen.Livia Jakob, from Earthwave in the U.K., explained, \"We've been able to use this technique to study glaciers all over the world and we can report that, in total, mountain glaciers lost 2% of their volume between 2010 and 2020.\"That adds up to 2,720 gigatons in all. This can be imagined as a giant ice cube, bigger than Europe's highest mountain, which is quite shocking. Importantly, we also found that air temperature, which causes the ice surface to melt, accounts for 89% of this ice loss.\"While warmer air temperatures are responsible for this decreasing \"surface mass balance,\" the research team found that something called \"ice discharge\" was responsible for the other 11% of ice lost.This is associated with glaciers that terminate at the coast, where warmer ocean waters are largely responsible for thinning the front of the ice flow.Dr. Gourmelen said, \"The relative contribution of decreasing surface mass balance and increasing ice discharge to sea-level change is well known for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Now we know more about how the atmosphere and ocean are teaming up to melt glaciers. There is still plenty of work to do to refine these numbers, and to incorporate this knowledge into our glacier projections.\"Stephen Plummer from ESA explains, \"The innovative work using CryoSat in swath altimetry mode demonstrates the value of its altimeter for monitoring glaciers, thus achieving one of the mission's secondary objectives.\"This work laid the basis for the Glacier Mass Balance intercomparison Exercise, Glambie, to reconcile the different estimates of glacier mass balance from a multitude of satellite and in-situ methods. It also helps in guiding the design of the Copernicus Sentinel Expansion CRISTAL mission for monitoring land ice, ensuring continuity in monitoring glaciers globally.\" More information:Livia Jakob et al, Glacier Mass Loss Between 2010 and 2020 Dominated by Atmospheric Forcing, Geophysical Research Letters (2023).

  "text": "ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, Juice, has recorded magnetic field data as its 10.6 m-long magnetometer boom deployed.          Juice launched on 14 April, with deployments and activation of its antennas, booms, sensors and instruments ongoing over the next months in a dedicated check-out period known as the commissioning phase.The Juice magnetometer boom (J-MAG) was deployed on 21 April, when Juice was about 1.7 million km from Earth.Data collected by J-MAG captured the moment of deployment itself.The plot shows the magnitude of the magnetic field from two sensors, as indicated by the red and turquoise lines, before (flat line) and during the deployment (curving lines). The two sensors are mounted on the outer segment of the boom and separated by about 3 m. The labels OBS and IBS indicate the data from the outboard (OBS) and inboard sensors (IBS), respectively. OBS is mounted close to the end of the 10.6 m boom.The left side of the plot shows the field trace before the boom deployment. The sensors are up against the side of the spacecraft and OBS is located close to two spacecraft thrusters, which are quite magnetic, explaining the difference in the two field magnitudes.The plot lines change as the boom deployment occurs, starting just after 14:29:38 UT and taking approximately two seconds.Thereafter, the two field magnitudes are at a similar level, trending towards zero and stable, indicating that the boom has deployed the full 10.6 m and both sensors are measuring the ambient solar wind field.The plot has been put together using very preliminary calibrations. Detailed instrument commissioning will start next week, including operation in its more sensitive ranges. It will also see the first switch-on of the third J-MAG sensor that will measure the magnetic field magnitude.Once in the Jupiter system in 2031, J-MAG will help characterize the planet's magnetic field and its interaction with that of giant moon Ganymede, and will study the subsurface oceans of the icy moons. J-MAG is one of ten instruments that will examine Jupiter and its largest ocean-bearing moons Ganymede, Europa and Callisto.With the critical deployment of the solar arrays and the medium gain antenna following launch, the next three months will focus on deploying and checking out the instruments.

  "text": "When two black holes merge, they emit gravitational waves that race through space and time at the speed of light. When these reach Earth, large detectors in the United States (LIGO), Italy (Virgo) and Japan (KAGRA) can detect the signals. By comparing against theoretical predictions, scientists can then determine the black holes' properties: masses, spins, orientation, position in the sky and distance from Earth.          A team of researchers from the Empirical Inference Department at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPI-IS) in T\u00fcbingen and the Department of Astrophysical and Cosmological Relativity at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute/AEI) in Potsdam has now developed a self-checking deep learning system that very accurately extracts information from gravitational-wave data.In the process, the system checks its own predictions about the parameters of merging black holes\u2014a deep neural network with a safety net. A set of 42 detected gravitational waves from merging black holes were successfully analyzed by the algorithm: When cross-checked against computationally expensive standard algorithms, the results were indistinguishable. The study was published on April 26, 2023 in the journal Physical Review Letters.DINGO: A deep neural network for gravitational-wave analysisThe researchers have developed a deep neural network called DINGO (Deep INference for Gravitational-wave Observations) to analyze the data. DINGO has been trained to extract\u2014or infer\u2014the gravitational-wave source parameters from the detector data. The network learned to interpret real (observed) gravitational-wave data after training with many millions of simulated signals in different configurations.                Credit: Max Planck Society             However, at first glance, it is not possible to tell whether the deep neural network is reading the information correctly. Indeed, one disadvantage of common deep learning systems is that their results sound plausible even when they are wrong. That's why the researchers at MPI-IS and AEI have added a control feature to the algorithm.Maximilian Dax, doctoral student in the Department of Empirical Inference at MPI-IS and first author of the publication explains, \"We have developed a network with a safety net. First, the algorithm calculates the properties of the black holes from the measured gravitational-wave signal. Based on these calculated parameters, a gravitational wave is modeled, and then compared to the originally observed signal. The deep neural network can thus cross-check its own results and correct them in case of doubt.\"      The algorithm controls itself, making it much more reliable than previous machine learning methods. But not only that. \"We were surprised to discover that the algorithm is often able to identify anomalous events, namely real data inconsistent with our theoretical models. This information can be used to quickly 'flag' data for additional investigation,\" says Stephen Green, co-lead author, and former Senior Scientist at the AEI (now at the University of Nottingham).\"We can guarantee the accuracy of our machine learning method\u2014which almost never happens in the field of deep learning. It therefore becomes compelling for the scientific community to use the algorithm to analyze gravitational-wave data,\" says Alessandra Buonanno, author and director of the Department Astrophysical and Cosmological Relativity at the AEI. Scientists from around the world are studying gravitational waves in large collaborations, such as the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), in which more than 1,500 researchers are organized.Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf, who is a Director at MPI-IS, adds, \"Today, DINGO analyzes gravitational-wave data\u2014but such a self-controlling and self-correcting method is also interesting for other scientific applications where it is crucial to be able to corroborate the correctness of 'black-box' neural network methods.\" More information:Maximilian Dax et al, Neural Importance Sampling for Rapid and Reliable Gravitational-Wave Inference, Physical Review Letters (2023).

  "text": "New research by University of Michigan astronomers presents the most detailed known images of the inner region of a planet-forming disk.          Resembling dusty infrared donuts, the images show unexpected moving structures in the disk around a young, massive star called V1295 Aquilae and confirm mysterious inner emissions reported in previous studies. The star is six times more massive than the sun and 900 times more luminous. It's only 100,000 years old; the sun is 4.5 billion years old.Noura Ibrahim, U-M doctoral candidate in astronomy and first author, discusses the study's findings that are published in The Astrophysical Journal.Why should we examine young stars?Young stars give us the unique opportunity to observe how star systems form. Our understanding of how our solar system formed is limited, let alone systems that don't look like ours. With the launch of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission and James Webb Space Telescope, there has been a surge to detect, confirm and characterize planets beyond our solar system, called exoplanets.So far we have over 5,000 confirmed exoplanets and over 6,000 potential candidates that don't conform to what we see in our solar system. That is why we want to look at the early stages of planet formation and examine the disks where exoplanets will eventually form.Why are these particular findings important?We are using the first and only technology that is powerful enough to probe the circumstellar disks at such small scales. Our images and models revealed a more complex story of possibly moving structures and inner emissions, which raise more questions.Also, we are demonstrating the power of interferometry (using two or more telescopes that work together) to perform cutting edge science at a fraction of the price of space telescopes, which can't compare with our 50 times better resolution.How does this paper advance the science and understanding of this field?We are using interferometry to study protoplanetary disks, which is a relatively broad subfield to begin with. These disks host planet formation and eventually turn into full stellar systems that are similar to our solar system in some aspects and completely different in others.Until recently, we have only been able to image the outer disks using Hubble, ALMA, Keck or VLT observatories, but the inner disk remained a mystery.      How did you image these inner disks?To get to the necessary resolving power, the only technique we can use is long-baseline optical interferometry. Interferometry works by combining the light from multiple telescopes that are arranged at a certain distance away from each other.We use the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy Array which is the largest optical and infrared interferometer in the world. The CHARA Array consists of six one meter telescopes arranged in a Y-formation which allows for a maximum resolving power equivalent to a single 331 meter diameter telescope. That's bigger than The Big House\u2014the U-M stadium.Our U-M team, led by Professor John Monnier, has designed, built and commissioned multiple infrared light combiners at the CHARA Array, which combine the light from all six telescopes simultaneously in different wavelength bands. In 2018, the team updated the Michigan InfraRed Combiner (MIRC-X) to add a state-of-the-art sensitive camera that can detect faint infrared light from the dusty disks.When I joined the U-M astronomy Ph.D. program in 2020, I was able to start analyzing observations taken with MIRC-X in 2019 right away. While not obvious from this distance on Earth, V1295 Aql is almost 900 times brighter than the sun and its high luminosity made it a great target for our modeling and imaging goals. I honestly felt a little spoiled, because of how beautiful the data were.Did anything about these findings challenge conventional wisdom?Previous models of inner disk emissions theorized that the \"cavity\" between where the dusty disk ends and the star wasn't all that dark. We already know that there is transparent dust-free gas in that cavity which would not produce light in infrared.The dust in the disk we see glows in infrared radiation because it is being heated by the star. At a certain temperature, the heat is too high for the dust to withstand and it gets destroyed, so theoretically, we should not see any emission from the middle because the dust is destroyed. The fact that we do see light from the center, prompts the question of what is creating the opacity that is giving off light.

  "text": "Using the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) onboard the International Space Station (ISS), an international team of astronomers has detected millihertz quasi-periodic oscillations from a low-mass X-ray binary known as 4U 1730\u201322. The finding was reported in a paper published March 29 in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.          X-ray binaries (XRBs) consist of a normal star or a white dwarf transferring mass onto a compact neutron star or a black hole. Based on the mass of the companion star, astronomers divide them into low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXB) and high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXB).At a distance of some 22,500 light years away, 4U 1730\u201322 is a transient LMXB first detected in 1972. After its discovery, 4U 1730\u201322 was in outburst for approximately 200 days, until it entered a long-term quiescence phase lasting until June 2021. The source experienced a rapid brightening that year, showcasing a thermonuclear X-ray burst, hence confirming that the compact object in the system is a neutron star.The latest outburst of 4U 1730\u201322 commenced in February 2022 and a team of researchers led by Giulio Cesare Mancuso of the La Plata National University in Argentina decided to perform NICER observations of this source in order to shed more light on its properties, which resulted in the detection of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). In general, such oscillations are believed to occur when X-rays are emitted near the inner edge of an accretion disk in which gas swirls onto a compact object like a neutron star or a black hole.\"Throughout the 2022 outburst, we detected 45 instances of mHz QPOs with significances greater than 4\u03c3 and in data sets longer than 700 s in a total of 35 observations,\" the astronomers explained.According to the study, the mHz QPO frequency was approximately constant within a data segment and between 4.5 and 8.1 mHz in the full data set, with an average fractional root-mean-square (rms) amplitude of the order of about 2%. The researchers noted that their findings are consistent with the frequency range of the mHz oscillations reported in other studied XRBs.Moreover, the team found two cases in which the mHz oscillations were followed by a thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray burst and disappeared afterwards. The researchers explained that this is one of the main characteristics that separates mHz QPOs from other types of QPOs observed in neutron star X-ray binary systems systems.The observations also found that 4U 1730\u201322 was in a soft spectral state during the QPO detections. Furthermore, it turned out that the mHz QPOs occurred when the system had a luminosity of approximately 1%\u20134% the value of the Eddington luminosity.Summing up the results, the authors of the paper concluded that the mechanism responsible for the mHz QPOs is most likely associated with marginally stable nuclear burning (MSNB).\"We conclude that the mHz QPOs reported in this work are also associated with the MSNB, making 4U 1730\u201322 the eighth source that shows this phenomenology,\" the researchers wrote.

  "text": "Two massive touching stars in a neighboring galaxy are on course to become black holes that will eventually crash together, generating waves in the fabric of space-time, according to a new study by researchers at UCL (University College London) and the University of Potsdam.          The study, accepted for publication in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, looked at a known binary star (two stars orbiting around a mutual center of gravity), analyzing starlight obtained from a range of ground- and space-based telescopes.The researchers found that the stars, located in a neighboring dwarf galaxy called the Small Magellanic Cloud, are in partial contact and swapping material with each other, with one star currently \"feeding\" off the other. They orbit each other every three days and are the most massive touching stars (known as contact binaries) yet observed.Comparing the results of their observations with theoretical models of binary stars' evolution, they found that, in the best-fit model, the star that is currently being fed on will become a black hole and will feed on its companion star. The surviving star will become a black hole shortly after.These black holes will form in only a couple of million years, but will then orbit each other for billions of years before colliding with such force that they will generate gravitational waves\u2014ripples in the fabric of space-time\u2014that could theoretically be detected with instruments on Earth.Ph.D. student Matthew Rickard (UCL Physics & Astronomy), lead author of the study, said, \"Thanks to gravitational wave detectors Virgo and LIGO, dozens of black hole mergers have been detected in the last few years. But so far we have yet to observe stars that are predicted to collapse into black holes of this size and merge in a time scale shorter than or even broadly comparable to the age of the universe.\"\"Our best-fit model suggests these stars will merge as black holes in 18 billion years. Finding stars on this evolutionary pathway so close to our Milky Way galaxy presents us with an excellent opportunity learn even more about how these black hole binaries form.\"Co-author Daniel Pauli, a Ph.D. student at the University of Potsdam, said, \"This binary star is the most massive contact binary observed so far. The smaller, brighter, hotter star, 32 times the mass of the Sun, is currently losing mass to its bigger companion, which has 55 times our Sun's mass.\"      The black holes that astronomers see merge today formed billions of years ago, when the universe had lower levels of iron and other heavier elements. The proportion of these heavy elements has increased as the universe has aged and this makes black hole mergers less likely. This is because stars with a higher proportion of heavier elements have stronger winds and they blow themselves apart sooner.The well-studied Small Magellanic Cloud, about 210,000 light years from Earth, has by a quirk of nature about a seventh of the iron and other heavy metal abundances of our own Milky Way galaxy. In this respect it mimics conditions in the universe's distant past. But unlike older, more distant galaxies, it is close enough for astronomers to measure the properties of individual and binary stars.In their study, the researchers measured different bands of light coming from the binary star (spectroscopic analysis), using data obtained over multiple periods of time by instruments on NASA's Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on ESO's Very Large Telescope in Chile, among other telescopes, in wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet to optical to near infrared.With this data, the team were able to calculate the radial velocity of the stars\u2014that is, the movement they made towards or away from us\u2014as well as their masses, brightness, temperature and orbits. They then matched these parameters with the best-fit evolutionary model.Their spectroscopic analysis indicated that much of the outer envelope of the smaller star had been stripped away by its larger companion. They also observed the radius of both stars exceeded their Roche lobe\u2014that is, the region around a star where material is gravitationally bound to that star\u2014confirming that some of the smaller star's material is overflowing and transferring to the companion star.Talking through the future evolution of the stars, Rickard explained, \"The smaller star will become a black hole first, in as little as 700,000 years, either through a spectacular explosion called a supernova or it may be so massive as to collapse into a black hole with no outward explosion.\"\"They will be uneasy neighbors for around three million years before the first black hole starts accreting mass from its companion, taking revenge on its companion.\"Pauli, who conducted the modeling work, added, \"After only 200,000 years, an instant in astronomical terms, the companion star will collapse into a black hole as well. These two massive stars will continue to orbit each other, going round and round every few days for billions of years.\"\"Slowly they will lose this orbital energy through the emission of gravitational waves until they orbit each other every few seconds, finally merging together in 18 billion years with a huge release of energy through gravitational waves.\" More information:M.

  "text": "The plan will keep Voyager 2's science instruments turned on a few years longer than previously anticipated, enabling yet more revelations from interstellar space.          Launched in 1977, the Voyager 2 spacecraft is more than 12 billion miles (20 billion kilometers) from Earth, using five science instruments to study interstellar space. To help keep those instruments operating despite a diminishing power supply, the aging spacecraft has begun using a small reservoir of backup power set aside as part of an onboard safety mechanism. The move will enable the mission to postpone shutting down a science instrument until 2026, rather than this year.Voyager 2 and its twin Voyager 1 are the only spacecraft ever to operate outside the heliosphere, the protective bubble of particles and magnetic fields generated by the Sun. The probes are helping scientists answer questions about the shape of the heliosphere and its role in protecting Earth from the energetic particles and other radiation found in the interstellar environment.\"The science data that the Voyagers are returning gets more valuable the farther away from the Sun they go, so we are definitely interested in keeping as many science instruments operating as long as possible,\" said Linda Spilker, Voyager's project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which manages the mission for NASA.                Each of NASA\u2019s Voyager probes are equipped with three radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), including the one shown here. The RTGs provide power for the spacecraft by converting the heat generated by the decay of plutonium-238 into electricity. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech             Power to the ProbesBoth Voyager probes power themselves with radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), which convert heat from decaying plutonium into electricity. The continual decay process means the generator produces slightly less power each year. So far, the declining power supply hasn't impacted the mission's science output, but to compensate for the loss, engineers have turned off heaters and other systems that are not essential to keeping the spacecraft flying.With those options now exhausted on Voyager 2, one of the spacecraft's five science instruments was next on their list. (Voyager 1 is operating one less science instrument than its twin because an instrument failed early in the mission. As a result, the decision about whether to turn off an instrument on Voyager 1 won't come until sometime next year.)      In search of a way to avoid shutting down a Voyager 2 science instrument, the team took a closer look at a safety mechanism designed to protect the instruments in case the spacecraft's voltage\u2014the flow of electricity\u2014changes significantly. Because a fluctuation in voltage could damage the instruments, Voyager is equipped with a voltage regulator that triggers a backup circuit in such an event. The circuit can access a small amount of power from the RTG that's set aside for this purpose. Instead of reserving that power, the mission will now be using it to keep the science instruments operating.Although the spacecraft's voltage will not be tightly regulated as a result, even after more than 45 years in flight, the electrical systems on both probes remain relatively stable, minimizing the need for a safety net. The engineering team is also able to monitor the voltage and respond if it fluctuates too much. If the new approach works well for Voyager 2, the team may implement it on Voyager 1 as well.\"Variable voltages pose a risk to the instruments, but we've determined that it's a small risk, and the alternative offers a big reward of being able to keep the science instruments turned on longer,\" said Suzanne Dodd, Voyager's project manager at JPL. \"We've been monitoring the spacecraft for a few weeks, and it seems like this new approach is working.\"The Voyager mission was originally scheduled to last only four years, sending both probes past Saturn and Jupiter. NASA extended the mission so that Voyager 2 could visit Neptune and Uranus; it is still the only spacecraft ever to have encountered the ice giants.

  "text": "We've all heard that we should \"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle\" to save the planet, but what about applying any of the \"three R's\" to space?          Researchers at USC Viterbi's Information Sciences Institute (ISI) are tackling this challenge\u2014looking at how to reuse physical items that are already in space, namely, old satellites.Legacy Satellites There are currently several thousand satellites orbiting Earth. Many have already completed their missions or have outlived their primary lifespans\u2014these are \"legacy satellites.\" And while some of them may have broken hardware and will eventually run out of energy, leave orbit, and burn out in space, others are physically in good condition. So, the question becomes: what to do with them?Alefiya Hussain, ISI Research Team Leader explained, \"This project is looking at ways to possibly reuse satellites for different things. We are collaborating with the software company Tangram Flex to figure out how we can replace the software components within the satellites to re-purpose them.\"She continued, \"The approach we've taken is to look inside the satellite and say, this particular piece of software did this particular function before, can we actually replace that function to make it do something else as a path to repurposing it?\"So, the first step was to determine what the satellite originally did. And to do that, they'd need to work in reverse.Semantic Reverse Engineering (a.k.a. Figuring Out the Old Job) In computer science, \"semantics\" refers to the meaning of an instruction, or the process a computer performs when executing that instruction.The team would need to reverse engineer a satellite's software to understand what the original instructions were.This methodology stems from prior ISI projects that focused on capturing the semantics of cyber-physical systems' software, including a preliminary DARPA AIE (Artificial Intelligence Exploration) program. These are prior and ongoing efforts in different domains, such as drones and autonomous vehicles.Luis Garcia, ISI Research Lead explained bringing this thinking to satellites, \"When you think about analyzing this software, it's a reverse engineering project. You're trying to understand the semantics of these cyber-physical systems.\"He continued, \"Maybe you don't have access to the source code. Or maybe it's old software that you don't have the documentation for, and you want to have a better understanding about what this code is actually doing with respect to this physical system. Is it controlling how the satellite moves? Is it a communication issue? We wanted to know what the software was doing.\"      Can This Be Automated? The idea was to automate or semi-automate the semantic reverse engineering.Machine learning (ML) can be used to help automate many things; however ML models are trained by large datasets. There are a limited number of actual satellite software systems, which meant the team didn't have the vast amount of data helpful for training ML models.\"We were envisioning scenarios. But we wanted to understand if we could automate the process of a reverse engineer or a satellite expert trying to extract the representations of what's going on with the software? And that's difficult when you don't have access to a lot of data,\" said Garcia. How did the team solve this? Garcia explained, \"Oftentimes we'd generate our own software datasets that simulated the kind of scenarios we were going after.\"Their methodology worked, and the team was able to formalize a semi-automatic semantic reverse engineering pipeline, building on years of research at ISI with various agencies including DARPA and IARPA.Bring on the New JobHussain said, \"After doing semantic reverse engineering, we are exploring a process of guided restructuring to repurpose the satellite. In the long run, we would like to surgically replace software components to repurpose the satellite.\"In this effort, Tangram Flex and ISI are partnering to ensure that the U.S. Space Force and commercial companies can rapidly, securely, and confidently upgrade on-orbit software components such that the system functions as intended and is cyber secure.What's Next? Hussain said, \"This is a two-phase effort. We've completed Phase 1, which was to see if it is feasible to replace the software components within the satellites to repurpose them.\"Tangram Flex is a product-driven software development company with expertise in components-based modeling and software development, as well as system modernization, integration, assurance, and autonomy.Hussain continued, \"In collaborating with Tangram Flex, we have come to a point where we believe that yes, it is feasible.\" They hope to continue their work once Phase 2 of the project is announced. In Phase 1, the team determined that replacing software on-orbit is possible; Phase 2 will be about putting that plan into action.

  "text": "The US company Orbit Fab is aiming to produce the go-to \"gas stations\" in space, its CEO tells AFP, hoping its refueling technology will make the surging satellite industry more sustainable\u2014and profitable.          The solar panels typically attached to satellites can generate energy for their onboard systems such as cameras and radios, but can't help the orbiting objects adjust their positions, explains Daniel Faber, who co-founded the company in 2018.\"Everything always drifts, and so very quickly, you're not where you needed to be\u2014so you need to keep adjusting, which means you need to keep using up propellant,\" he tells AFP at the space industry's annual gathering in Colorado Springs, Colorado.Satellites' lives are therefore limited by how much fuel they can carry along with them\u2014at least for now.\"If you can refuel satellites in orbit,\" Faber says, \"you can stop them having to be thrown away\"\u2014a model he describes as \"crazy\" due to their high cost to manufacture and launch.His company envisions sending several large tanks into orbit, each containing up to several tons of fuel.Then smaller, more easily maneuverable vessels will shuttle back and forth between the tanks and satellites\u2014like robotic pump attendants.Asked what the risks associated with operating such a system in orbit are, Faber is candid: \"Everything you might imagine.\"But he reassures that with lots of testing on the ground, and in orbit, \"it's going to be safe.\"Like cars, satellites hoping to receive additional propellant from Orbit Fab will have to have compatible fuel ports.Less weight, more profitFaber says that between 200 and 250 satellites are already being designed to use his company's system.It's a market with room to grow: Some 24,500 satellites have been scheduled for launch between 2022 and 2031, according to the consultancy Euroconsult.Orbit Fab, which employs about 60 people and is looking to hire 25 more, has already launched one tank into orbit and next plans to conduct fuel transfer tests.In 2019, it proved the feasibility of the system with water-transfer tests at the International Space Station.                Orbit Fab wants to refuel satellites, like the one depicted above, while they're still in space, in order to increase their longevity.             \"Our first contract with the US government is to deliver them fuel in 2025\" to Space Force satellites, Faber says.He says they are planning to launch only a couple fuel shuttles to geostationary orbit, where satellites mostly lie in \"a single plane around the equator\" at a high altitude of about 22,000 miles (36,000 kilometers).Satellites in low Earth orbit have much different trajectories, and more fuel shuttles will be needed.Another added benefit of in-orbit refueling is the possibility of freeing up the key metric in rocket launches: weight.Projects which were previously deemed infeasible for being too heavy might therefore see the light of day.But above all, extending the life of satellites makes them more profitable in the long run.      To the MoonApart from refueling, companies are also looking at other ways of servicing satellites, with Faber saying that some 130 companies have recently popped up in the sector.These include in-orbit \"tow trucks\" that can approach satellites in trouble and make repairs, such as helping deploy a solar panel or reorienting an antenna.Orbit Fab, which recently announced it had raised $28.5 million, has a \"symbiotic\" relationship with these start-ups, says Faber.Their machines will need refuelling and in return could \"be doing things that we want, services we want, maybe repair our spacecraft, if there's a problem,\" he explains.They have already struck an agreement to refuel craft launched by Astroscale, a Japanese company seeking to clear space debris, among other services.Orbit Fab also aims to serve private space stations currently under development.And it's also looking towards a possible market on and around the Moon, focusing not on extracting materials, but transforming them into propellant and delivering that to clients.\"At the moment, there's nothing there\" on the Moon,\" says Faber.\"In five, 10, 20 years time we expect that will change dramatically.\"    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Out of gas in orbit?

  "text": "Andy Weir's bestselling 2011 book, \"The Martian,\" features botanist Mark Watney's efforts to grow food on Mars after he becomes stranded there. While Watney's initial efforts focus on growing potatoes, new research presented at the 54th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference by a team of interdisciplinary researchers from the U of A suggests future Martian botanists like Watney may have a better option: growing rice.          As outlined in the team's abstract, \"Rice Can Grow and Survive in Martian Regolith with Challenges That Could be Overcome Through Control of Stress-Related Genes,\" one of the biggest challenges to growing food on Mars is the presence of perchlorate salts, which have been detected in the planet's soil and are generally considered to be toxic for plants.The team was able to simulate Martian soil using basaltic rich soil mined from the Mojave Desert, called the Mojave Mars Simulant, or MMS, which was developed by scientists from NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.The teams then grew three varieties of rice, including one wild-type and two gene-edited lines with genetic mutations that better enable them to respond to stress, such as drought, sugar starvation or salinity. These varieties were grown in the MMS, as well as a regular potted mix and a hybrid of the two. While plants were able to grow in the Martian simulant, they were not as developed as those grown in the potting soil and hybrid mix. Replacing just a quarter of the Martian simulant with potting soil resulted in improved development.The team also experimented with the amount of perchlorate in the soil, finding that 3 grams per kilogram was the threshold beyond which nothing would grow, while mutant strains could still root in 1 gram per kilogram.Their findings suggest that there might be a way forward for genetically modified rice to find purchase in Martian soil.Next steps will include experimenting with a newer Martian soil simulant called the Mars Global Simulant, as well as other rice strains that have increased tolerance for higher salt concentrations. An important part of the research will be determining to what degree perchlorate may be leeching into the plant from the soil. Farther down the road, the researchers would like to introduce rice into a closed habitat chamber and place it in a Mars simulation chamber that replicates the temperature and atmosphere of the planet.Whether humans ever colonize Mars, the team's research could have applications here on Earth. Second author on the abstract, Abhilash Ramachandran, a post-doctoral fellow at the Arkansas Center for Space and Planetary Sciences, noted that he spoke with an Australian researcher from an area where the soil had high salinity, and saw their work as a potential way to grow food there. He added, \"We could use Earth as a terrestrial analog before the seeds ever get sent to Mars.\"First author on the abstract, Peter James Gann, a doctoral student in cell and molecular biology, said that the project began when he met Ramachandran for coffee in the student union. \"He was new here at the university, and we shared the things we were doing in our respective laboratories. Since he works on planetary science, and I specialize in cell and molecular biology, we decided to try out plants.\"They were joined by co-authors Yheni Dwiningsih, a post-doctoral associate in plant sciences; Dominic Dharwadker, an undergraduate student in the Honors College; and Vibha Srivastava, a professor in the Department of Crop, Soil and Environmental Sciences who has a joint appointment with the U of A System Division of Agriculture.

  "text": "The rare metal terbium has been found in an exoplanet's atmosphere for the first time. The researchers at Lund University in Sweden have also developed a new method for analyzing exoplanets, making it possible to study them in more detail.          KELT-9 b is the galaxy's hottest exoplanet, orbiting its distant star about 670 light years from Earth. The celestial body, with an average temperature of a staggering 4,000 degrees Celsius, has since its discovery in 2016 excited the world's astronomers. The new study, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics, reveals discoveries about the scalding-hot oddball's atmosphere.\"We have developed a new method that makes it possible to obtain more detailed information. Using this, we have discovered seven elements, including the rare substance terbium, which has never before been found in any exoplanet's atmosphere,\" says Nicholas Borsato, Ph.D. student in astrophysics at Lund University.Terbium is a rare earth metal that belongs to the so-called lanthanoids. The substance was discovered in 1843 by the Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander in the Ytterby mine in the Stockholm archipelago. The substance is very rare in nature, and 99% of the world's terbium production today takes place in the Bayan Obo mining district in Inner Mongolia.\"Finding terbium in an exoplanet's atmosphere is very surprising,\" says Nicholas Borsato.Most exoplanets are discovered by astronomers making measurements of how brightly stars shine. When an exoplanet passes in front of its star, the star's brightness decreases. Thanks to their advanced measurement method, the researchers have succeeded in filtering out the dominant signals in KELT-9 b's atmosphere. This opens up the possibility of finding out more about the atmospheres of other exoplanets.\"Learning more about the heavier elements helps us, among other things, to determine the age of the exoplanets and how they were formed,\" explains Nicholas Borsato.Exoplanets, or extrasolar planets, are planets that are in other solar systems than our own. The first confirmed discovery was made in 1992, of an exoplanet orbiting a neutron star. Three years later, the first exoplanet with a sun-like star was discovered. Since then, over 5,000 exoplanets have been recorded. The existence of exoplanets often raises questions about the possibility of life elsewhere in the universe.\"Detecting heavy elements in the atmospheres of ultra-hot exoplanets is another step towards learning how the atmospheres of planets work. The better we get to know these planets, the greater chance we have of finding Earth 2.0 in the future,\" concludes Nicholas Borsato. More information:N. W.

  "text": "Not one, but two rocket launches with ESA-led experiments are flying to the edge of space just a week apart, providing unique data to researchers eager to learn more about fundamental physics, semiconductor production, the formation of planets and how our immune cells react to spaceflight.          A Texus sounding rocket can propel up to 270 km altitude to return to Earth in an elongated arc. As it falls freely, the experiments inside experience weightlessness\u2014six minutes of valuable research time each for these flights, to then land softly on the tundra near the Esrange launch facility in Sweden.VIPER, planets and iron fuelThe first rocket, Texus-58, launched on 25 April at 07:20 CEST with three ESA-led experiments, all linked with previous research.The VIPER experiment investigates the interaction between free-floating particles and growing crystals. Several industrial processes, such as growing crystals for solar cells, suffer from an unavoidable amount of dirt, or what scientists call foreign phase particles. This research could improve the quality of the crystalline material.To analyze what is happening scientists removed gravity from the equation. Silicon is not transparent, so any crystal formation is hard to judge. The VIPER experiment uses water as an analogy for growth processes in industry.Wim Sillekens, ESA's materials science lead for Human and Robotic Exploration says, \"The idea is a very basic one, but that often makes the experiment very complicated!\" In just six minutes the beads were injected and the water frozen, all while being recorded and traveling at supersonic speeds.A second study tries to simulate the first stages of planet formation. It takes thousands of years for dust particles to grow into centimeter-sized clouds in protoplanetary disks. To shorten the timescale, the ICAPS experiment increases the concentration of dust particles and observes their growth within a few minutes using a microscope.The experiment flew on the sounding rocket for the second time equipped with a new instrument to observe how the light scattered.The Texus-58 sounding rocket launched on 25 April at 07:20 CEST with three ESA-led experiments, all linked with previous research. A Texus sounding rocket can propel up to 270 km altitude to return to Earth in an elongated arc. As it falls freely, the experiments inside experience weightlessness \u2013 six minutes of valuable research time. Once the rocket motors shut off, the experiments enter freefall, even though at this point they are still heading upwards. On the downward arc parachutes deploy and gravity takes over once again, lowering the experiments to the ground with impact speeds of around 8 m/s. ESA has used sounding rockets for over 30 years to investigate phenomena under microgravity from Esrange in northern Sweden. Experiments are held in circular containers with diameters of up to 60 cm. The containers are held by elastic dampers to reduce launch vibrations. Credit: SSCThis week's launch included a continuation of the Perwaves experiment that studies how flames propagate through clouds of iron particles in oxygen and xenon gas. Without the effect of gravity to disrupt the suspensions in glass tubes, the iron flame shows unique behaviors, slowly carving its path through the mixture by jumping from particle to particle instead of burning fuel continuously.A unique 3D reconstruction of the flames will allow the researchers to better understand how they and a whole family of waves behave. The data is also important to chart the way for a carbon-free fuel of the future: iron dust. Burn iron dust and you get rust\u2014and a lot of energy. Data from Perwaves can allow engineers to design better burners to extract that energy.      T-Rex on a rocket and double data safariNext Monday, 1 May, will see the Texus 59 rocket launch with two ESA experiments sharing the ride with another investigation on flame propagation, called Topoflame, from the German Aerospace Center.ESA's T-Rex experiment is an abbreviation for T-cell gene regulation experiment and it will look at how the gene expression system in immune cells responds to the sounding rocket flight.Previous experiments showed that it takes just 20 seconds for cells to react to weightlessness. The research team wants to understand how gravity is encoded in our genome.This flight was a repetition of previous flight on a sounding rocket in 2015. The difference lies on an integrated and far-reaching analysis. The series are part of a larger effort to understand the process, and it includes experiments on the International Space Station.The second ESA experiment is called SaFari and investigates crystal growth in semiconductors. An eight-millimeter silicon crystal will be partly molten and re-crystallized after cooling down.Silicon doesn't melt easily\u2014a furnace will heat the material above 1,400\u00b0C within a few seconds. Scientists will analyze the inner part of the crystal. The outcome after the six-minute flight will lead to a better understanding of the causes of crystal defects in semiconductors for technological applications.\"These semiconductor experiments will help create better computer chips and solar panels, as we understand the process to make them better,\" concludes Wim.

  "answer_squad": " CHIME/FRB Discovery of 25 Repeating Fast Radio Burst Sources",
  "text": "A Canadian-led research team has doubled the number of repeating fast radio bursts, adding 25 new 'cosmic probes'.          Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are cosmic radio signals: extremely short, energetic pulses of radio emission emanating from space. They're an astronomical mystery, as scientists aren't sure exactly what causes them and where they come from.And while astronomers have identified more than 500 FRBs to date, only 25 were observed to repeat\u2014until now. The new research by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)/FRB collaboration, which includes UBC researchers, adds a further 25 repeating FRBs to the list, and suggests we may just not have been watching FRBs for long enough. Of the repeating FRBs the collaboration observed from 2019 to 2021, some had just two bursts while others had as many as 12.\"Many apparently one-off FRBs have simply not yet been observed long enough for a second burst from the source to be detected,\" said corresponding author Dr. Ziggy Pleunis (he/him), a Dunlap postdoctoral fellow at the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics.Astronomers do know that FRBs come from far outside of the Milky Way. They are likely to be the dense cores of once-massive, exploded stars with strong magnetic fields. Because repeating FRBs have different characteristics than FRBs not observed to repeat, including the range of frequencies emitted, astronomers thought they may have different origins.Finding more repeating sources is key to answering this question.The research published today in The Astrophysical Journal provides 25 new sources for study. Astronomers can use FRBs as cosmic probes to measure various properties of the universe. \"One exciting avenue of research is utilizing them to measure the amount of matter between galaxies, or the intergalactic medium,\" said co-author Adam Dong (he/him), a doctoral student in the UBC department of physics and astronomy (PHAS).The group calculated the fraction of FRBs that repeat and found it was about two percent. This could mean repeating FRBs are rare, or just have long intervals between bursts, Dong said. \"We need a longer observation time because some repeaters could repeat every 10 years. We just don't know. They don't play by our time scales.\"Repeating FRBs allow observation of the same source with other telescopes in more detail, as well as more information about the diversity of emission a source can produce. \"FRBs that repeat are great targets for other telescopes, including those that can measure their positions very accurately, and let us know which galaxies they come from,\" says co-author Dr. Ingrid Stairs (she/her), PHAS professor. \"In the long run, we hope to learn a lot about their origins.\"This is the first time the CHIME team have combed through the data to find every repeating source detected so far. To make this happen, they developed a new set of statistical tools. Dong's work involved clustering FRBs that are close to one another, observed over two years, which was then used to ascertain if the signals were likely to be from the same source.CHIME, located near the UBC Okanagan campus, has the capacity to scan the entire northern sky every day. \"Because it sees from horizon to horizon at any given moment, CHIME is far better than any other telescope at finding FRBs even when we don't know in advance where or when they'll go off,\" says co-author Dr. Alex Hill (he/him), assistant professor of physics at UBCO.The team highlighted 14 further sources which they say are promising repeating FRB candidates. Also of interest was a measured difference between non-repeating and repeating FRBs' dispersion measures, which could mean the two are indeed from different sources, or merely from observational effects, the authors say.

One of the researchers on the project is Dr. Thomas Smyth, a Senior Lecturer in Physical Geography within the Department of Biological and Geographical Sciences in the School of Applied Sciences.Alongside researchers from Ulster University, California Institute for Technology (Caltech) and the University of Wisconsin Madison in the U.S., the research has discovered a more informed and realistic Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) microscale modeling method, which will provide more detailed insight into the surface wind forcing of aeolian transport patterns on Martian surfaces such as dunes.CFD is a method regularly used in car design, turbomachinery, ship design, and aircraft manufacturing and has proved to be beneficial in astrophysics, biology, oceanography, oil recovery, architecture, and meteorology. It uses applied mathematics, physics and computational software to visualize how a gas or liquid flows\u2014as well as how the gas or liquid affects objects as it flows past.                Research has discovered a more informed and realistic Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) microscale modeling method, which will provide more detailed insight into the surface wind forcing of aeolian transport patterns on Martian surfaces such as dunes and will help to identify safe landing sites with increased accuracy, further paving the way for the first manned mission to the red planet. Credit: NASA, Caltech and the University of Huddersfield             The research, led by Ph.D. student Richard Love from Ulster University, has been published in the journal PLOS ONE and follows on from previous work Dr. Smyth was involved in titled \"The dune effect on sand-transporting winds on Mars\" which used \"fine scale\" 3D computer modeling to \"unravel complex airflow patterns on the planet\" and \"firmly identify the direction of winds passing over sand dunes on Mars\" that until then had been misinterpreted.\"We used to think sand dunes on Mars were perhaps static and didn't move,\" said Dr. Smyth, \"but as spacecraft started orbiting the planet and rovers landed on Mars, we started to notice they moved relatively quickly and Mars was in fact, actually quite dynamic.\"Dr. Smyth explained how the previous research, published in Nature Communications, modeled wind flow over sand dunes using a virtual wind tunnel and mapped the wind speed to how the sand dunes were moving on the surface of Mars, which at the time they found it mapped quite well and with good accuracy.\"Fast forward seven years however, and after working closely with Richard, we have now discovered a more informed and realistic Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) microscale modeling method,\" said Dr. Smyth.\"Richard's nested modeling approach allows for a more landscape-scale understanding to be obtained on the movement of the sand dunes on Mars and could avoid situations such as placing a Rover in an area that we suddenly find out is incredibly dynamic,\" he added.

  "text": "Astronomers have recently observed a low-mass X-ray binary known as IGR J17407\u22122808 with NuSTAR and XMM-Newton space telescopes. In result, they detected several fast X-ray flares from this source. The finding was reported in a paper published April 18 on the arXiv pre-print repository.          X-ray binaries (XRBs) are composed of a normal star or a white dwarf transferring mass onto a compact neutron star or a black hole. Based on the mass of the companion star, astronomers divide them into low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs).Discovered on October 9, 2004, by the International Gamma-Ray Astronomy Laboratory (INTEGRAL), IGR J17407\u22122808 (or J17407 for short) is an LMXB at a distance of some 12,400 light years away from the Earth. Although J17407 exhibited several peculiarly quick and strong flares in the past, it remained a poorly studied source.A team of astronomers led by Lorenzo Ducci of the University of Tuebingen in Germany decided to change this by conducting a comprehensive investigation of J17407's enigmatic nature using NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and ESA's XMM-Newton space observatories.\"In an attempt to clarify the nature of this object, in this work we report on the remarkable flaring activity detected for the first time from J17407 by NuSTAR during an observation performed in 2022. We also analyze the first source broadband spectrum (\u223c0.2-60 keV) obtained by combining the NuSTAR data with a quasi-simultaneous observation carried out with XMM-Newton during the persistent low luminosity state of the source,\" the researchers wrote.NuSTAR observations conducted by Ducci's team detected J17407 in a flaring state characterized by a variability as large as three orders of magnitude on time scales of a few tens of seconds. During this state, the source exhibited several fast X-ray flares, lasting between 1 to 100 seconds and profiles with either single or multiple peaks.The astronomers noted that the fast and strong variability of J17407 is similar to that observed in some other LMXB systems like Swift J1858.6\u22120814, V404 Cygni, and V4641 Sgr or in a HMXB designated A0538\u221266. However, they underlined that given that some fundamental characteristics of the stellar components hosted in J17407 are still unknown, it is difficult to conclude what accretion mechanisms are triggering its X-ray variability.According to the authors of the paper, analysis of the collected data suggests that the donor star in J17407 can be either a rare K or M-type sub-subgiant or a K-type main sequence (MS) star, or sub-giant star. Therefore, the researchers propose spectroscopic observations of J17407 in optical near-infrared in order to disentangle the true nature of the donor star, noting that their recent results further support the classification of this system as an LMXB.

  "text": "Scientists studying the supermassive black hole at the heart of the M87 galaxy have revealed the origins of the monster's powerful jet and imaged the jet and its source together for the first time. What's more, the observations have revealed that the black hole's ring is much larger than scientists previously believed. The observations are published today (April 26) in Nature.          The Global mm-VLBI Array (GMVA) united radio telescopes around the world to produce these new results, including the National Science Foundation's National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) and Green Bank Observatory (GBO), Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), and Green Bank Telescope (GBT).The SMBH at the center of the M87 galaxy is the most recognizable in the universe. It was the first black hole to be captured in an image, created by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and made public in 2019. The image of its dense, dark core framed by an amorphous glowing ring made international headlines.\"M87 has been observed over many decades, and 100 years ago we knew the jet was there, but we couldn't place it in context,\" said Ru-Sen Lu, an astronomer at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, leader of a Max Planck Research Group at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and lead author of the new paper. \"With GMVA, including the premier instruments at NRAO and GBO, we're observing at a lower frequency so we're seeing more detail\u2014 and now we know there are more details to see.\"Eduardo Ros, an astronomer and the Scientific Coordinator for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy added, \"We've seen the ring before, but now we see the jet. This puts the ring in context\u2014and it's bigger than we thought. If you think of it like a fire-breathing monster, before, we could see the dragon and the fire, but now we can see the dragon breathing the fire.\"                Scientists observing the compact radio core of M87 have discovered new details about the galaxy's supermassive black hole. In this artist's conception, the black hole's massive jet is seen rising up from the center of the black hole. The jet was born from energy created by the magnetic fields surrounding the spinning core of the black hole and winds rising up from the black hole's accretion disk. The observations represent the first time that the jet and the black hole have been imaged together, giving scientists new context into the compact radio core of M87. These observations also revealed that the black hole's ring is 50% larger than previously believed. Credit: S. Dagnello (NRAO/AUI/NSF)             Using many different telescopes and instruments gave the team a more complete view of the structure of the supermassive black hole and its jet than was previously possible with EHT, and all of the telescopes were required to paint a full picture. While VLBA provided a full view of both the jet and the black hole, ALMA allowed the scientists to resolve M87's bright radio core, and create a sharp picture. The sensitivity of the GBT's 100-meter collecting surface enabled astronomers to resolve both the large and small-scale parts of the ring and see the finer details.      \"The original EHT imaging revealed only a portion of the accretion disk surrounding the center of the black hole. By changing the observing wavelengths from 1.3 millimeters to 3.5 millimeters, we can see more of the accretion disk, and now the jet, at the same time. This revealed that the ring around the black hole is 50% larger than we previously believed,\" said scientist Toney Minter, GMVA coordinator for the GBT.Not only are the parts of the black hole bigger than shorter wavelength observations previously revealed, but it is now possible to confirm the origin of the jet. This jet was born from the energy created by the magnetic fields surrounding the spinning core of the black hole and winds rising up from the black hole's accretion disk.\"These results showed\u2014for the first time\u2014where the jet is being formed. Prior to this, there were two theories about where they might come from,\" said Minter. \"But this observation actually showed that the energy from the magnetic fields and the winds are working together.\"Harshal Gupta, NSF Program Officer for the Green Bank Observatory, added, \"This discovery is a powerful demonstration of how telescopes possessing complementary capabilities can be used to fundamentally advance our understanding of astronomical objects and phenomena. It is exciting to see the different types of radio telescopes supported by NSF work synergistically as important elements of the GMVA to enable the big picture view of M87's black hole and jet.\" More information:R.-S.

  "text": "Morphological study of open clusters can provide observational evidence for tracing the formation mechanism of star clusters and help to explore the evolution of star clusters.          The morphology of open clusters on the two-dimensional (2D) projection planes mostly conforms to the core-shell structure. However, whether this layered structure actually exists in three-dimensional (3D) space is not known.Recently, researchers from the Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory (XAO) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences proposed a rose diagram overlaying method based on Gaia data to study the 3D layered structure of open cluster samples within 500 parsec (pc) near the sun.Results showed that the proposed method could quantitatively depict the morphology of open star clusters and provide method support for identifying the 3D structure of open cluster samples. The method may play an important role in structural classification of open clusters. The study was published in Astronomy and Astrophysics.The researchers used the rose diagrams to quantitatively depict the random morphology of open clusters on three projection surfaces in 3D space. The synthetic rose diagram of each open cluster sample was obtained by overlay, and whether the composite diagram has a stable core circle was used as an indicator to identify whether the open cluster sample has a 3D layered structure.They found that if a stable inner circle appeared in the superimposed rose diagram of a cluster, then the open cluster had a 3D layered structure. In addition, they defined the basic parameters of the 3D layered structure, including circle core area and irregular nuclear region, the unstable kernel area, and the unstable parameters of the layered structure.Through statistical analysis, they also found that the circle core area of the open cluster sample maintained a relatively significant positive correlation with the number of its own member stars, while there was a significant negative correlation between the irregular nuclear region of the layered structure of the open cluster sample and the number of its own member stars.This study is the first to explore the 3D layered structure of open star clusters using the rose diagram overlaying method. The physical mechanism behind the 3D layered structure of star clusters and the conditions for forming the 3D layered structure of star clusters still need to be further studied.

  "question_squad": " What is the largest distant galaxy cluster ever observed using existing telescopes?",
  "answer_squad": " El Gordo",
  "text": "Astrophysicists have been trying to understand the formation of cosmological objects and phenomena in the universe for decades. Past theoretical studies suggest that quantum fluctuations in the early universe, known as primordial quantum diffusion, could have given rise to so-called primordial black holes.          In a paper published in Physical Review Letters, researchers at Niels Bohr Institute, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid and CNRS Universit\u00e9 de Paris recently explored the possibility that these fluctuations could also affect the creation of even larger cosmological structures, such as heavy galaxy clusters like \"El Gordo.\" El Gordo is the largest distant galaxy cluster ever observed using existing telescopes, which was first captured more than 10 years ago.\"The question of how structure formed in the universe might be one of the most ancient ones, but since the early 1980s it has gained a new dimension,\" Jose Mar\u00eda Ezquiaga, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org. \"At the time, scientists realized the incredible connection between the smallest and the largest scales, in which quantum fluctuations in the very early universe are stretched by a cosmic inflation to seed the formation of galaxies and large-scale structures in the universe.\"After physicists first started learning more about the connections between the early and late universe, the idea that black holes could be formed in the early universe started emerging. In 2015, the first observations of black hole mergers via gravitational waves renewed interest in this area, sparking new theoretical studies focusing on the primordial origin of black holes.\"Juan, Vincent and I had been investigating the formation of primordial black holes in the early universe,\" Ezquiaga said. \"Our key contribution was realizing that when quantum fluctuations are dominating the dynamics of cosmic inflation, this leads to a spectrum of density fluctuations that is non-Gaussian, with heavy exponential tails. In other words, quantum diffusion makes it easier to generate large fluctuations that would collapse into a primordial black hole.\"      After studying primordial black holes in the early universe, Ezquiaga and his colleagues Vincent Vennin and Juan Garcia-Bellido started wondering whether the same mechanism underpinning their formation, namely an enhanced non-Gaussian tail in the distribution of primordial perturbations, could also lead to the formation of other very large cosmological structures. In their recent work, they specifically explored the possibility that this mechanism affects the collapse of larger objects such as dark matter halos, which will later host galaxies and groups of galaxies.\"The formation of larger objects early on in the history of the universe could help alleviate some tensions between observations and our standard cosmological model,\" Ezquiaga explained. \"For example, under standard assumptions, massive clusters like El Gordo may look like outlier, while quantum diffusion make them natural.\"As part of their recent study, Ezquiaga and his colleagues computed the halo mass function and cluster abundance as a function of redshift in the presence of heavy exponential tails. This allowed them to determine whether quantum diffusion could increase the number of large galaxy clusters, depleting dark matter halos.\"Because gravity is always attractive, inhomogeneities will only grow as overdensities will attract mass for their surroundings and under densities will become emptier,\" Ezquiaga said. \"The question is whether inhomogeneities in the early universe are large and frequent enough to lead to the gravitational collapse necessary to explain the observed structures in the cosmos. Given an initial distribution of perturbations one only needs to press 'play' and let the system evolve gravitationally, In our case, we had a previous understanding of the distribution of initial perturbations when including quantum diffusion, so our job in this work was to parametrize in a suitable way this spectrum and analyze the results for the number of massive clusters as a function of redshift.\"The researchers' paper suggests that quantum fluctuations in the early universe might not only underly the formation of average-sized galaxies and primordial black holes, but also that of massive galaxy clusters, like the fascinating \"El Gordo\" and Pandora clusters. This would mean that current observations of galaxy clusters could be explained using existing theories, without the need to incorporate new physics in the standard model.\"The other very exciting outcome of our work is that it predicts unique signatures that could be tested in the near future,\" Ezquiaga said. \"In particular, we demonstrate that quantum diffusion not only makes heavy clusters easier to form early on, but also that the amount of substructure should be lower than expected.\"The simultaneous enhancement of massive cosmological structures and the depletion of substructures (i.e., halos) is not predicted by other theoretical models. Nonetheless, this potential theoretical explanation for the formation of large galaxy clusters appears to be aligned with recent cosmological observations and could also potentially solve other shortcomings of the standard model.In their next studies, Ezquiaga and his colleagues would like to paint a more complete picture of the structures in the universe and their formation. This could ultimately also help to fully probe the predictions of quantum diffusion.\"Next for us is fully testing the predictions of this model against observations,\" Ezquiaga added. \"Luckily, there are many new observations that we can use. In particular, the very recent observations of James Webb Space Telescope seem to indicate that there are many more massive galaxies at high redshift, somethings naturally aligning with our predictions, but we are waiting for astronomers to fully understand their systematics and confirm this 'unexpected' population. The other observations that might be interesting for us are number counts of dwarf galaxies with galaxy surveys like the Dark Energy Survey and constraints on subhalos from strong lensing.\" More information:Jose Mar\u00eda Ezquiaga et al, Massive Galaxy Clusters Like El Gordo Hint at Primordial Quantum Diffusion, Physical Review Letters (2023).

More than six hours after communication ceased, the Tokyo company ispace finally confirmed what everyone had suspected, saying there was \"a high probability\" that the lander had slammed into the moon.It was a disappointing setback for ispace, which after a 4 1/2-month mission had been on the verge of doing what only three countries have done: successfully land a spacecraft on the moon.Takeshi Hakamada, founder and CEO of ispace, held out hope even after contact was lost as the lander descended the final 33 feet (10 meters). Flight controllers peered at their screens in Tokyo as minutes went by with only silence from the moon.A grim-faced team surrounded Hakamada as he announced that the landing likely failed.Official word finally came in a statement: \"It has been determined that there is a high probability that the lander eventually made a hard landing on the moon's surface.\"If all had gone well, ispace would have been the first private business to pull off a lunar landing.

That was also the expected length of the full mission.Named Hakuto, Japanese for white rabbit, the spacecraft had targeted the Atlas crater in the northeastern section of the moon's near side, more than 50 miles (87 kilometers) across and just over 1 mile (2 kilometers) deep.

The UAE\u2014already in orbit around Earth with an astronaut aboard the International Space Station and in orbit around Mars\u2014was seeking to extend its presence to the moon.The moon is suddenly hot again, with numerous countries and private companies clamoring to get on the lunar bandwagon.

  "text": "Scientists have unlocked one of the biggest mysteries of quasars\u2014the brightest, most powerful objects in the universe\u2014by discovering that they are ignited by galaxies colliding.          First discovered 60 years ago, quasars can shine as brightly as a trillion stars packed into a volume the size of our solar system. In the decades since they were first observed, what could trigger such powerful activity has remained a mystery. New work led by scientists at the Universities of Sheffield and Hertfordshire has now revealed that it is a consequence of galaxies crashing together.The work is published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.The collisions were discovered when researchers, using deep imaging observations from the Isaac Newton Telescope in La Palma, observed the presence of distorted structures in the outer regions of the galaxies that are home to quasars.Most galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers. They also contain substantial amounts of gas\u2014but most of the time this gas is orbiting at large distances from the galaxy centers, out of reach of the black holes. Collisions between galaxies drive the gas towards the black hole at the galaxy center; just before the gas is consumed by the black hole, it releases extraordinary amounts of energy in the form of radiation, resulting in the characteristic quasar brilliance.The ignition of a quasar can have dramatic consequences for entire galaxies\u2014it can drive the rest of the gas out of the galaxy, which prevents it from forming new stars for billions of years into the future.This is the first time that a sample of quasars of this size has been imaged with this level of sensitivity. By comparing observations of 48 quasars and their host galaxies with images of over 100 non-quasar galaxies, researchers concluded that galaxies hosting quasars are approximately three times as likely to be interacting or colliding with other galaxies.The study has provided a significant step forward in our understanding of how these powerful objects are triggered and fueled.Professor Clive Tadhunter, from the University of Sheffield's Department of Physics and Astronomy, said, \"Quasars are one of the most extreme phenomena in the universe, and what we see is likely to represent the future of our own Milky Way galaxy when it collides with the Andromeda galaxy in about five billion years.\"It's exciting to observe these events and finally understand why they occur\u2014but thankfully Earth won't be anywhere near one of these apocalyptic episodes for quite some time.\"Quasars are important to astrophysicists because due to their brightness, they stand out at large distances and therefore act as beacons to the earliest epochs in the history of the universe.Dr. Jonny Pierce, Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Hertfordshire, explains, \"It's an area that scientists around the world are keen to learn more about\u2014one of the main scientific motivations for NASA's James Webb Space Telescope was to study the earliest galaxies in the universe, and Webb is capable of detecting light from even the most distant quasars, emitted nearly 13 billion years ago. Quasars play a key role in our understanding of the history of the universe, and possibly also the future of the Milky Way.\" More information:J C S Pierce et al, Galaxy interactions are the dominant trigger for local type 2 quasars, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (2023).

  "text": "NASA switched off one of its oldest instruments studying Mars on April 3, a step that's been planned since last year. Riding aboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, CRISM, or the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars, revealed minerals such as clays, hematite (otherwise known as iron oxide), and sulfates across the Red Planet's surface for 17 years.       Led by Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, CRISM produced high-resolution mineral maps crucial in helping scientists understand how lakes, streams, and groundwater shaped the planet billions of years ago. The instrument's two detectors saw in visible and infrared light, spotting the chemical fingerprints, or spectra, of minerals that form in the presence of water.\"Shutting down CRISM marks the end of an era for us,\" said Rich Zurek, MRO's project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the mission. \"It's revealed where and how water transformed ancient Mars. The CRISM data products will be mined by scientists for years to come.\"NASA has also relied on CRISM maps to figure out where the most scientifically interesting landing sites are, as with Gale Crater, which Curiosity has been exploring since 2012, and Jezero Crater, where NASA's Perseverance rover recently collected its 19th sample.                This image shows six views of the Nili Fossae region of Mars captured by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM), one of the instruments aboard NASA\u2019s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The varying colors represent minerals on the Martian surface seen in different wavelengths of light. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/JHU-APL             In order to study infrared light, which is radiated by warm objects and is invisible to the human eye, CRISM relied on cryocoolers to isolate one of its spectrometers from the warmth of the spacecraft. Three cryocoolers were used in succession, and the last completed its lifecycle in 2017.The CRISM team then looked for ways to continue producing data without the use of cryocoolers, deciding to create two new, nearly global maps. The first of these relied on data previously collected by the infrared spectrometer and by the second spectrometer on the instrument, which viewed a more limited range of minerals in visible and near-infrared light. This first map of water-related minerals, containing 5.6 gigapixels, has a spatial resolution of 600 feet (180 meters) per pixel and covers 86% of Mars. Scientists began releasing it in sections last year.For the second map, CRISM's remaining spectrometer gathered data at an even higher spatial resolution (300 feet, or 90 meters per pixel). This map is slated for release in September.\"With these new maps, researchers can easily tie mineral deposits observed in high-resolution images to regional scale trends, landscape features, and geology,\" said Kim Seelos, CRISM's deputy principal investigator at APL. \"Even though the CRISM investigation is formally coming to a close, I hope and expect to see many future scientists taking advantage of CRISM data for their research.\" Provided byJPL/NASACitation:NASA retires mineral mapping instrument on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (2023, April 25)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-nasa-mineral-instrument-mars-reconnaissance.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_race": " A Strange Asteroid---More Than Dust",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the asteroid that is closest to the sun?",
  "answer_squad": " 3200 Phaethon",
  "text": "A weird asteroid has just gotten a little weirder.          We have known for a while that asteroid 3200 Phaethon acts like a comet. It brightens and forms a tail when it's near the sun, and it is the source of the annual Geminid meteor shower, even though comets are responsible for most meteor showers. Scientists had blamed Phaethon's comet-like behavior on dust escaping from the asteroid as it's scorched by the sun. However, a new study using two NASA solar observatories reveals that Phaethon's tail is not dusty at all but is actually made of sodium gas.\"Our analysis shows that Phaethon's comet-like activity cannot be explained by any kind of dust,\" said California Institute of Technology Ph.D. student Qicheng Zhang, who is the lead author of a paper published in the Planetary Science Journal reporting the results.Asteroids, which are mostly rocky, do not usually form tails when they approach the sun. Comets, however, are a mix of ice and rock, and typically do form tails as the sun vaporizes their ice, blasting material off their surfaces and leaving a trail along their orbits. When Earth passes through a debris trail, those cometary bits burn up in our atmosphere and produce a swarm of shooting stars\u2014a meteor shower.After astronomers discovered Phaethon in 1983, they realized that the asteroid's orbit matched that of the Geminid meteors. This pointed to Phaethon as the source of the annual meteor shower, even though Phaethon was an asteroid and not a comet.In 2009, NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) spotted a short tail extending from Phaethon as the asteroid reached its closest point to the sun (or \"perihelion\") along its 524-day orbit. Regular telescopes hadn't seen the tail before because it only forms when Phaethon is too close to the sun to observe, except with solar observatories.This two-hour sequence of images from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) shows Phaethon (circled) moving relative to background stars. The images were taken on May 15, 2022, when the 3.4-mile-wide asteroid ventured close to the Sun, at a distance of 13 million miles. While SOHO routinely observes the Sun, it also observes many objects that pass near the Sun, including comets and asteroids. The random white specks are energetic particles, or cosmic rays, that constantly bombard the SOHO camera. Credit: ESA/NASA/USNRL/Karl BattamsSTEREO also saw Phaethon's tail develop on later solar approaches in 2012 and 2016. The tail's appearance supported the idea that dust was escaping the asteroid's surface when heated by the sun.      However, in 2018, another solar mission imaged part of the Geminid debris trail and found a surprise. Observations from NASA's Parker Solar Probe showed that the trail contained far more material than Phaethon could possibly shed during its close approaches to the sun.Zhang's team wondered whether something else, other than dust, was behind Phaethon's comet-like behavior. \"Comets often glow brilliantly by sodium emission when very near the sun, so we suspected sodium could likewise serve a key role in Phaethon's brightening,\" Zhang said.An earlier study, based on models and lab tests, suggested that the sun's intense heat during Phaethon's close solar approaches could indeed vaporize sodium within the asteroid and drive comet-like activity.Hoping to find out what the tail is really made of, Zhang looked for it again during Phaethon's latest perihelion in 2022. He used the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft\u2014a joint mission between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA)\u2014which has color filters that can detect sodium and dust. Zhang's team also searched archival images from STEREO and SOHO, finding the tail during 18 of Phaethon's close solar approaches between 1997 and 2022.In SOHO's observations, the asteroid's tail appeared bright in the filter that detects sodium, but it did not appear in the filter that detects dust. In addition, the shape of the tail and the way it brightened as Phaethon passed the sun matched exactly what scientists would expect if it were made of sodium, but not if it were made of dust.                The Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) imaged asteroid Phaethon through different filters as the asteroid passed near the Sun in May 2022. On the left, the sodium-sensitive orange filter shows the asteroid with a surrounding cloud and small tail, suggesting that sodium atoms from the asteroid\u2019s surface are glowing in response to sunlight. On the right, the dust-sensitive blue filter shows no sign of Phaethon, indicating that the asteroid is not producing any detectable dust. Credit: ESA/NASA/Qicheng Zhang             This evidence indicates that Phaethon's tail is made of sodium, not dust.\"Not only do we have a really cool result that kind of upends 14 years of thinking about a well-scrutinized object,\" said team member Karl Battams of the Naval Research Laboratory, \"but we also did this using data from two heliophysics spacecraft\u2014SOHO and STEREO\u2014that were not at all intended to study phenomena like this.\"Zhang and his colleagues now wonder whether some comets discovered by SOHO\u2014and by citizen scientists studying SOHO images as part of the sungrazer Project\u2014are not comets at all.\"A lot of those other sunskirting 'comets' may also not be 'comets' in the usual, icy body sense, but may instead be rocky asteroids like Phaethon heated up by the sun,\" Zhang explained.Still, one important question remains: If Phaethon doesn't shed much dust, how does the asteroid supply the material for the Geminid meteor shower we see each December?Zhang's team suspects that some sort of disruptive event a few thousand years ago\u2014perhaps a piece of the asteroid breaking apart under the stresses of Phaethon's rotation\u2014caused Phaethon to eject the billion tons of material estimated to make up the Geminid debris stream. But what that event was remains a mystery.More answers may come from an upcoming Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) mission called DESTINY+ (short for Demonstration and Experiment of Space Technology for Interplanetary voyage Phaethon fLyby and dUst Science). Later this decade, the DESTINY+ spacecraft is expected to fly past Phaethon, imaging its rocky surface and studying any dust that might exist around this enigmatic asteroid.

  "text": "Microbes are just about everywhere, from the soil to the air to Arctic ice to oceans, lakes, and rivers\u2014not to mention all over your body and the phone or computer you're using right now.          \"It's rare to find a place where there are no microbes,\" says Jeffrey J. Marlow, a Boston University College of Arts & Sciences assistant professor of biology. But there are exceptions: extreme environments\u2014hot molten lava, boiling water jetting from deep sea vents\u2014where the absence of microbes gives Marlow and his team an opportunity to study how these organisms survive and change over time. How long, for example, does it take for microbes to inhabit a cooling piece of molten rock, and where do they even come from?Microbes\u2014single-celled organisms like bacteria and archaea\u2014help sustain life on Earth, driving nutrient cycles, breaking down organic matter and chemicals, and producing oxygen. They can cause infections, too, but the vast majority are neutral. Understanding these invisible yet indispensable communities can help scientists unlock the origins of life on Earth\u2014the oldest fossil records, dating back 3.5 billion years, are traces of microbes\u2014and serve as a guide for finding life on other planets.\"Life permeates the Earth, quickly altering new habitats. However, the details of how and how quickly microbes take control of new environments has never been observed over sustained intervals of time,\" says Peter Schroedl, a Ph.D. student in BU's Program in Ecology, Behavior & Evolution who works in Marlow's lab.Respecting an active volcanoOver the past year, Marlow, Schroedl, and other lab members have been laying the groundwork for a project documenting microbial habitation on newly formed rock. They traveled, along with students Erin Frates and Dylan Mankel, to one of the most extreme environments in the world: an active volcano.In 2021, a new volcanic eruption began in Iceland's Fagradalsfjall volcano after 781 years of dormancy. And then, it erupted again in August 2022. Locals and tourists all rushed to the scene to take epic photos, of course. But for researchers, this presented a rare opportunity to collect fresh rock samples, and get a close look at the molten insides of our planet. Marlow and his team of students went to the volcano site just weeks before the second eruption, when the land was still hot and lava was still trickling underground from the first one.\"Jeff took a piece of rock that we were sampling, put it in a bag, and the bag started to melt,\" Frates says. She is a second-year Ph.D. student who studies microbial diversity and their metabolic activity in Marlow's lab. She and her teammates traversed the edge of the lava field away from tourists, chiseling off pieces of hardened basaltic rock.                Erin Frates, Dylan Mankel, Peter Schroedl, and Jeffrey Marlow in the lab holding pieces of igneous rock collected from Fagradalsfjall, Iceland. Credit: Cydney Scott             In the week they were there, the team collected samples, incubated and preserved them, and brought them back to Boston\u2014all while ensuring they didn't become contaminated.Once lava cools and hardens into a rock, microbes can move in\u2014but how long does that take? And who are they? Where do they come from? Marlow and his team are looking to see what type of microbial communities appear, and ultimately, what particular environmental and biological factors set a chunk of volcanic rock on the path toward becoming a forest or another developed ecosystem.\"The fact that life could, and actively does, conduct chemical reactions on its own is amazing; it seems like magic,\" says Frates. \"Microbes are tiny chemists.\"In the past, researchers have found that it takes less than four months for microbes to move into a newly formed rock, Marlow says, but the specifics beyond that have not been well documented. In the lab, the rocks, which shimmer with speckles of green and blue, are awaiting DNA and mineral composition analysis. This will clarify which microbes were present at the time the rocks were found, 10 months after their formation. The team also has samples just days or weeks old, thanks to a partnership with collaborator Solange Duhamel at the University of Arizona. The researchers plan to return to the volcano to take another batch of samples to see how the microbial community has changed in the year since they visited.\"Our work provides an opportunity to discern how microbes wrest control of an abiotic environment, using a continuing volcanic eruption as an ideal natural laboratory,\" Schroedl says. He stayed in the weeks after Marlow's group left to continue doing research with NASA's RAVEN project, which tests drones in Iceland's lava fields for future Mars exploration. He was there to witness Fagradalsfjall roar to life after more than a year of inactivity, and took the opportunity to collect additional samples.\"Roaring is no exaggeration,\" Schroedl says. \"It is a rare privilege to get up close and personal with an erupting volcano, respecting the volcano and honoring that rarity was personally of the utmost importance.\"      Underwater chemistryJust weeks after trekking around the Icelandic volcano, Marlow threw himself into another extreme environment. That same summer, he ventured more than 5,000 meters below the Caribbean Sea aboard the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's Alvin submersible, which had recently reached historic depths of 6,500 meters. Marlow attended a two-week-long cruise with scientists from across the world to test the submersible's scientific capabilities. He also collected samples from the Mid-Cayman Spreading Center, an area of mid-ocean ridges where two tectonic plates are slowly separating and material is spewing from the interior, making it a hot spot of hydrothermal vents.                The rocks are preserved in their natural state in order to gather accurate DNA information about any microbial life that could be present. This will give the researchers clues about when the microbes inhabited the rock after it hardened, and where they might have come from. Credit: Cydney Scott             Scientists believe that hydrothermal vents\u2014which are basically underwater volcanoes\u2014were a breeding ground for the earliest microbes. These vents are a cocktail of chemicals, sediments, and hot liquid from deep in the Earth mixing with cool ocean water\u2014vent fluid can be 400 degrees Celsius, and the seawater only 4 degrees C, resulting in huge temperature differences in the span of just a few inches. Marlow wants to find the threshold where microbes can survive in such conditions.During his time in the sub, he examined the watery depths for new tectonic activity, while other dives retrieved chunks of hydrothermal vent chimneys, largely composed of copper, sulfur, and other metals.Back in a lab, Marlow mixed raw materials\u2014like carbon, nitrogen, or amino acids\u2014with the sample material to track the microbes eating and breaking down the added components, giving clues to the microbial abundance and activity. For now, the vent sample is sealed and waiting to be studied. He is particularly interested in microbes that metabolize methane, called anaerobic methanotrophs. In a 2021 paper, Marlow and a team of scientists studied four different marine methane seeps, which is where methane gas leaks from seafloor sediments, in the Gulf of Mexico, the US Atlantic Margin, the Guaymas Basin, and off the California coast. They found that previous studies had vastly underestimated the rock-based methanotrophs' methane consumption.\"Methane is a very strong greenhouse gas, and there are aquatic microbes that eat the methane before it gets to the surface,\" Marlow says. About 80 percent of methane released underwater gets gobbled up by microbes, he says, saving that gas from ever reaching the atmosphere.\"Microbes are the world's premier chemists, and when we work with them, we can accomplish truly spectacular feats,\" says Schroedl. If it weren't for a 1966 discovery, we wouldn't have COVID-19 tests, which use an enzyme first discovered in a heat-resistant microorganism found at a Yellowstone lake. When it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Marlow believes methanotrophs could potentially be studied as a way to sequester and regulate methane gas.Beyond our own planet, scientists are using microbes found in extreme environments as templates for finding single-celled life on other planets and moons\u2014since deserts, volcanoes, and seafloor vents are the most analogous places we have to Mars and Saturn's biggest moon, Titan. This is broadly called astrobiology, a field that seeks to find possible extraterrestrial life by studying Earth's systems. By continuing the hunt for early microbes in the most harsh places, Marlow and his team hope to contribute more to understanding life here\u2014and beyond.\"What is happening, even when it seems out of sight, is still directly impacting the whole planet,\" Frates says. \"There's inherent value in exploration.\" Provided byBoston UniversityCitation:What microbes can tell us about life on Earth and in space (2023, April 25)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-microbes-life-earth-space.html  This document is subject to copyright.

Meanwhile, SpaceX continues to build out a backup site for human launches on the Space Coast to assuage NASA fears of potential Starship damage for when it starts flying from Kennedy Space Center.Those launches won't come until SpaceX completes testing from SpaceX's Starbase launch site in Boca Chica, Texas where the first integrated launch of the Starship and its Super Heavy booster took place last Thursday.While it didn't make it to space, the booster's 33 Raptor engines that can produce more than 17 million pounds of thrust was able to clear the launch tower. About four minutes after flying only to about 24 miles and tumbling back to Earth, SpaceX sent the self-destruct command resulting in the rocket exploding over the Gulf of Mexico.\"The vehicle experienced multiple engines out during the flight test, lost altitude, and began to tumble,\" reads an update on the SpaceX website. \"The flight termination system was commanded on both the booster and ship.\"While Musk had tempered expectations for the Starship mission to complete its goal of making it to space and flying 2/3 the way around the Earth on a suborbital flight path, teams said clearing the launch pad was their No. 1 goal, and part of a testing approach by the company that expects hardware to fail through more frequent test launches.While the failing engines and lack of a planned stage separation are two big problems for the next launch attempt, repairing the major damage from the launch site will be needed first.\"All that's left of the concrete lateral support beam is the rebar! Hopefully, this didn't gronk the launch mount,\" Musk posted on Twitter to images comparing the launch site's construction to post-launch damage.Musk said the company had prepared for a \"massive water-cooled, steel plate to go under the launch mount,\" but that it was not ready in time for the test launch.He said \"we wrongly thought\" the launch pad concrete would survive the launch based on data from a static fire performed in February that saw 31 of the 33 engines manage a successful test burn.\"Still early in analysis, but the force of the engines when they throttled up may have shattered the concrete, rather than simply eroding it,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"The engines were only at half thrust for the static fire test.\"      Video from around the launch site showed chunks of concrete flying all over the place including several pieces into the surf just over a quarter mile away. One piece slammed into an unoccupied minivan for website NASASpaceflight.com that was parked close to the pad to shoot video prompting tweets of \"RIP NSF Van.\"\"The two cameras we placed on the roof of the van got hit and were taken out. Obviously, this was all at our own risk which was well understood,\" posted Michael Baylor, part of the live stream team for the website.Images of the rocket lifting into the sky showed only 27 of the 33 engines lit up a minute into flight, and more have failed before the mission concluded. It's unclear if any were damaged by debris on liftoff.\"With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and we learned a tremendous amount about the vehicle and ground systems today that will help us improve on future flights of Starship,\" the company posted on it site.Starship's power was nearly twice that of NASA's Space Launch System that still holds the record at 8.8 million pounds of thrust for a rocket that actually made it to space during its launch from Kennedy Space Center last November on the Artemis I moon mission. The damage SLS did to the Mobile Launcher at Kennedy Space Center's Launch Pad 39-B has led to what continues to be months of repair work as teams get it ready for Artemis II in 2024.The sheer power of Starship for what's planned to be future launches from KSC at SpaceX's Launch Pad 39-A raised NASA concerns last year with the uncertainty of what sort of damage it might do to the pad. SpaceX is continuing to build out a Starship launch tower at 39-A for when the spacecraft is ready for operational flights.The problem, though, without Boeing's Starliner as a backup yet, NASA relies on SpaceX with its Crew Dragon spacecraft as its sole U.S.-based transport of astronauts to the International Space Station. Those launches for now can only take place from 39-A, and the potential threat of Starship launch pad damage has driven SpaceX to work on upgrading its nearby launch site at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station's Space Launch Complex 40 so it could fly the Dragon spacecraft as well.\"SpaceX and the NASA team has done an incredible job laying out the crew and cargo capability from pad 40,\" said NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager Steve Stich in February. \"SpaceX has started groundbreaking on that pad, and actually the initial work to clear the site and then pour the pilings for the crew tower.\"SpaceX's Dragon mission management director Sarah Walker said she expects the site to be ready this fall for initial launches with just cargo.\"We've think it enables even greater flexibility to our Dragon customers,\" she said. \"Our primary focus first will allow cargo missions to launch and just allow them to be interchangeable between the two pads, 39 and 40. And then we'll add the final certification elements for human spaceflight capability soon after, but we're seeing good progress.\"NASA has a vested interest in Starship progress as well, though, as it will rely on a version of it to act as the Human Landing System for the Artemis III mission as soon as 2025, which aims to return humans including the first woman to the surface of the moon for the first time since Apollo 17 in 1972.NASA Administrator Bill Nelson congratulated the SpaceX team last Thursday posting on Twitter despite the mission ending in a fireball.\"Every great achievement throughout history has demanded some level of calculated risk, because with great risk comes great reward,\" he posted. \"Looking forward to all that SpaceX learns, to the next flight test\u2014and beyond.\"    2023 Orlando Sentinel.

  "text": "Japanese start-up ispace conceded Wednesday its ambitious attempt to become the first private company to land on the Moon had failed but pledged to move ahead with new missions.          The unmanned Hakuto-R Mission 1 lander had been scheduled to arrive on the Moon's surface overnight but communications were lost during its descent and had still not been reestablished 25 minutes after the scheduled landing.\"It has been determined that there is a high probability that the lander eventually made a hard landing on the Moon's surface,\" ispace said in a statement.The company said its engineers were working to establish why the landing had failed.\"Although we do not expect to complete the lunar landing at this time, we believe that we have fully accomplished the significance of this mission, having acquired a great deal of data and experience,\" ispace CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada said.\"What is important is to feed this knowledge and learning back to Mission 2 and beyond,\" he said.Hakamada said the firm is developing two further attempts to land on the lunar surface and the setback would not change that.Still, the apparent crash marks a frustrating end to a mission that began with the lander's launch last December aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.The vessel was carrying payloads from several countries, including a lunar rover from the United Arab Emirates.Chief technology officer Ryo Ujiie became emotional as he addressed reporters, describing the attempt as a \"very precious experience\".

Plans for settling the MoonIspace, which listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Growth Market this month, was already planning its next mission before the failure of Hakuto-R.The spacecraft, whose name refers to the Moon-dwelling white rabbit of Japanese folklore, was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on December 11.The lander carried several lunar rovers, including a round, baseball-sized robot jointly developed by Japan's space agency and toy manufacturer Takara Tomy, the creator of the Transformer toys.It also had the 10-kilogram (22-pound) chair-sized Rashid rover developed by the United Arab Emirates and an experimental imaging system from Canadensys Aerospace.The UAE'S space centre praised ispace for working \"tirelessly\" on the mission and said its team was \"inspired and believes that greater accomplishments are yet to come in our pursuit of space exploration\".With just 200 employees, ispace has said it \"aims to extend the sphere of human life into space and create a sustainable world by providing high-frequency, low-cost transportation services to the Moon\".Hakamada touted the mission as laying \"the groundwork for unleashing the Moon's potential and transforming it into a robust and vibrant economic system\".The firm believes the Moon will support a population of 1,000 people by 2040, with 10,000 more visiting each year.It plans a second mission, tentatively scheduled for next year, involving both a lunar landing and the deployment of its own rover.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Hard landing: Japan firm fails in historic Moon bid (2023, April 25)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-japan-firm-moon.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "The large impact craters dotting our planet are powerful reminders that asteroids and comets strike the Earth from time to time. As often said, it's not a question of \"if\"; it's a matter of \"when\" our planet will face an impending strike from space. But an impact is one existential threat humanity is finally starting to take seriously and wrap its head around.          Seemingly spurred by the success of the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), NASA just released a new planetary defense strategy and action plan, describing its efforts to find and identify potentially hazardous objects to provide an advanced warning, and then even push them off an impact trajectory.This 10-year strategy looks to advance efforts to protect the Earth from a devastating encounter with a Near Earth asteroid or comet.\"An asteroid impact with Earth has potential for catastrophic devastation, and it is also the only natural disaster humanity now has sufficient technology to completely prevent,\" said Lindley Johnson, NASA's planetary defense officer, in a NASA press release. \"The release of this NASA strategy steps up NASA's intentions for the next 10 years to ensure the agency works both nationally and internationally to protect our planet for the benefit of all.\"The 46-page \"NASA Planetary Defense Strategy and Action Plan\" (pdf document) was released on April 18, 2023 and follows another document that was put out on April 3 by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, \"National Preparedness Strategy and Action Plan for Near-Earth Object Hazards and Planetary Defense\" (pdf document).Each of the reports focuses on enhancing the detection, characterization and responses to impact threats as well as improving international cooperation for coordinating strategies among government agencies.NASA wants to focus on six key areas for planetary defense over the next decade:Improving NEO survey, detection, and characterization efforts to work toward a completed catalog of all NEOs that might pose an impact hazard to EarthDeveloping and demonstrating NEO mitigation technologies similar to the agency's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission, the world's first planetary defense test mission, which successfully demonstrated one method of asteroid deflection using a kinetic impactor spacecraftFostering international collaboration related to NEO surveying and mitigation to leverage international capabilitiesStrengthening interagency coordination between NASA and other U.S. government agencies to enhance and streamline U.S. government NEO preparedness and response planningReview the agency's internal planning to maximize the benefits obtained from limited resourcesBetter integrate messaging regarding planetary defense work with the agency's strategic communicationsEach of the strategy objectives are defined into short-term, medium-term, long-term, and ongoing timelines with the goal of meeting all objectives within the next 10 years.                NEO size and hazard. Credit: Johns Hopkins University / Applied Physics Lab             The Near Earth Objects (NEOs) that NASA feels are of most concern range in diameter from 10 m (33 ft.) to more than 10,000 meters (33,000 ft), and that come within 42 million km (30 million miles of the Earth's orbital path.For decades, scientists and other proponents have been championing the need for humanity to prepare for an what will certainly happen at some point. Apollo astronaut Rusty Schweickart, who helped found the planetary defense nonprofit advocate B612 Foundation has talked with Universe Today numerous times about planetary defense. Even back in 2010, he emphasized that the technology needed to divert an asteroid already existed.\"That is, we do not have to go into a big technology development program in order to deflect most asteroids that would pose a threat of impact,\" he said. He also added that coordination and cooperation between countries around the world was essential, and would perhaps be even more difficult to organize than the technology.JWST captured this sequence of the DART collision on Dimorphos. Courtesy NASA, ESA, CSA, and STScI.\"Bureaucracy is the most likely reason we will be hit with an asteroid in the future, not the technology,\" said Schweickart. \"That is an audacious statement to make, but if we can get past that and do our jobs right we should never be hit in the future by an asteroid that could threaten life on Earth. And it's going to be a heck of a challenge.\"Of course, finding the NEOs that are potentially on course for our planet is key. One such mission is now officially on track. The Near Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor mission is a space telescope to detect near Earth asteroids as part of NASA's planetary defense efforts. The fiscal year 2023 omnibus spending bill enacted in December directed NASA to spend no less than $90 million on this mission and it is tentatively set to launch no earlier than 2028.The DART mission was a key milestone for addressing the need for testing ways to deflect an asteroid. On Sept. 26, 2022, DART slammed into Dimorphos, a 530-ft. asteroid moonlet almost 7 million mi. from Earth and successfully demonstrated a kinetic-impact strategy for diverting an NEO on a course to strike the Earth. Dimorphos does not pose an actual threat, but was chosen for the test because it and its larger parent asteroid, Didymos, could be observed from Earth before and after the encounter to measure the effectiveness of a kinetic impact.\"As we saw with the success of the DART mission, NASA is committed to protecting Earth from potentially hazardous asteroids and comets,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"Planetary defense benefits all of humanity and NASA's strategy and action plan outlines how we will continue to protect our home planet over the next decade.\"NASA says that the release of this plan of action is an important step forward in ensuring the momentum of DART and the upcoming NEO Surveyor mission continues to move forward for safeguarding Earth from potentially hazardous NEOs for generations to come.

The Mission 1 lander, from the Tokyo-based commercial company ispace, took the image during the time of the April 20 solar eclipse, where totality was visible in Australia; and so the photo includes a perfect view of the shadow of the moon passing above the Land Down Under.       The spacecraft was approximately 100 km (60 miles) above the lunar surface when it took the photo.\"We've received another incredible photo from the camera onboard our Mission 1 lander!\" ispace Tweeted this morning.Earth and the moon are seen with stunning clarity, showcasing the lander-mounted camera's abilities.This could be a big week for Hakuto-R, as its landing on the moon could come as soon as today, Tuesday, April 25 at 16:40 (UTC)/12:40 (EST). This is the earliest targeted landing date, but it could change depending on how the checkouts proceed.The Hakuto-R mission launched on Dec. 11, 2022 along with the Lunar Flashlight mission on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Ispace is aiming to become the first commercial company to have an uncrewed lunar lander touch down safely on the moon. Hakuto-R was originally designed for the Google Lunar XPrize. But it got a chance to launch only in 2022, long after the competition was over.The launch trajectory took the spacecraft on a journey approximately 1.4 million km (879,000 miles) into deep space before it successfully entered lunar orbit on March 21, 2023 after a several-minute controlled burn.The ispace Series 1 Lunar Lander stands about 2.3 meters tall (7.5 ft) and has four landing legs, and fully fueled with its payload, it weighs roughly 1000 kg (2,200 lbs). The main body is an octagonal prism, 1.6 meters high and about 1.6 meters (5.25 X 5.25 ft) across its widest diameter. It has one main landing thruster and six assist thrusters. Its electronics are powered by solar panels.The startup is planning a second lunar lander mission perhaps in 2024, depending on the success of this first mission. In addition to launching lunar landers, the company aims to one day deploy satellites around the moon. Ispace says it is negotiating with multiple companies for transporting payloads to the lunar surface, as well as carrying payloads to orbit around the moon.

  "text": "If they exist, intermediate-mass black holes likely devour wayward stars like a messy toddler\u2014taking a few bites and then flinging the remains across the galaxy\u2014a new Northwestern University-led study has found.          In new 3D computer simulations, astrophysicists modeled black holes of varying masses and then hurled stars (about the size of our sun) past them to see what might happen.When a star approaches an intermediate-mass black hole, it initially gets caught in the black hole's orbit, the researchers discovered. After that, the black hole begins its lengthy and violent meal. Every time the star makes a lap, the black hole takes a bite\u2014further cannibalizing the star with each passage. Eventually, nothing is left but the star's misshapen and incredibly dense core.At that point, the black hole ejects the remains. The star's remnant flies to safety across the galaxy.Not only do these new simulations hint at the unknown behaviors of intermediate-mass black holes, they also provide astronomers with new clues to help finally pinpoint these hidden giants within our night sky.\"We obviously cannot observe black holes directly because they don't emit light,\" said Northwestern's Fulya K\u0131ro\u011flu, who led the study. \"So, instead, we have to look at the interactions between black holes and their environments. We found that stars undergo multiple passages before being ejected. After each passage, they lose more mass, causing a flair of light as its ripped apart. Each flare is brighter than the last, creating a signature that might help astronomers find them.\"Watch an intermediate-mass black hole take a bite of a wayward star and then fling the leftovers across the galaxy. Credit: Fulya K\u0131ro\u011flu/Northwestern UniversityK\u0131ro\u011flu will present this research during the virtual portion of the American Physical Society's (APS) April meeting. The Astrophysical Journal has accepted the study for publication.While astrophysicists have proven the existence of lower- and higher-mass block holes, intermediate-mass black holes have remained elusive. Created when supernovae collapse, stellar remnant black holes are about 3 to 10 times the mass of our sun. On the other end of the spectrum, supermassive black holes, which lurk in the centers of galaxies, are millions to billions times the mass of our sun.Should they exist, intermediate-mass black holes would fit somewhere in the middle\u201410 to 10,000 times more massive than stellar remnant black holes but not nearly as massive as supermassive black holes. Although these intermediate-mass black holes theoretically should exist, astrophysicists have yet to find indisputable observational evidence.                A star (bright orange dot on right) flying across the galaxy after being ejected from an intermediate-mass black hole (small ring on left). Credit: Fulya Kiroglu/Northwestern University             \"Their presence is still debated,\" K\u0131ro\u011flu said. \"Astrophysicists have uncovered evidence that they exist, but that evidence can often be explained by other mechanisms. For example, what appears to be an intermediate-mass black hole might actually be the accumulation of stellar-mass black holes.\"To explore the behavior of these evasive objects, K\u0131ro\u011flu and her team developed new hydrodynamic simulations. First, they created a model of a star, consisting of many particles. Then, they sent the star toward the black hole and calculated the gravitational force acting on the particles during the star's approach.\"We can calculate specifically which particle is bound to the star and which particle is disrupted (or no longer bound to the star),\" K\u0131ro\u011flu said.Through these simulations, K\u0131ro\u011flu and her team discovered that stars could orbit an intermediate-mass black hole as many as five times before finally being ejected. With each pass around the black hole, the star loses more and more of its mass as its ripped apart. Then, the black hole kicks the leftovers\u2014moving at searing speeds\u2014back out into the galaxy. The repeating pattern would create a stunning light show that should help astronomers recognize\u2014and prove the existence of\u2014intermediate-mass black holes.\"It's amazing that the star isn't fully ripped apart,\" K\u0131ro\u011flu said. \"Some stars might get lucky and survive the event. The ejection speed is so high that these stars could be identified as hyper-velocity stars, which have been observed at the centers of galaxies.\"Next, K\u0131ro\u011flu plans to simulate different types of stars, including giant stars and binary stars, to explore their interactions with black holes.

  "text": "An international team of space scientists has found evidence suggesting that planets could have formed during the so-called \"cosmic noon.\" In their study, reported in the journal Nature Astronomy, the group used data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to study a part of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) to learn more about planet development around young stars.          For many years, astronomers have been studying planet creation and the likelihood of the existence of planets similar to Earth. But it is still not clear how planets could have could come to exist in the early universe when most, if not all of the stars, were small. In this new effort, the research team focused on a part of the night sky known as the SMC, a dwarf galaxy not too far from the Milky Way. More specifically, they focused their attention on a part of the SMC called NGC 346, because it is made up of hundreds of young, low-mass stars. They wanted to know if planets were forming there. To find out, they turned to data from the JWST.Prior research has shown that planets form via accretion of materials from and around a star. But researchers have believed that that the materials also need to be the right kind, such as aluminum, silicon and iron. Such materials are thought to be in short supply around small, young stars, suggesting that planets are unlikely to form around them.To learn more, the team used infrared data from JWST, which can see through the dust clouds that typically surround small, young developing stars. They found that past assumptions are wrong. The data revealed evidence of rock-forming elements in the SMC, despite the lack of metals\u2014elements that are similar to materials found in galaxies that are much farther away. Such materials are believed to represent a period in the universe known as \"cosmic noon,\" when huge numbers of stars were forming all across the universe. And that suggests that many planets may have been forming around them at that time. More information:Olivia C.

  "text": "A distant star, dying a fiery and dramatic death, torn apart by a supermassive black hole in a forgotten corner of the sky. One of the most luminous, energetic, long-lasting transient objects didn't blaze through the night sky inspiring legends and launching civilizations. Instead, astronomers, acting as celestial supersleuths, uncovered evidence of the star's death throes where it had hidden undetected for years in a mass of computer-gathered telescope data.          \"It's absurd. If you take a typical supernova and multiply it a thousand times, we're still not at how bright this is\u2014and supernovas are among the most luminous objects in the sky,\" said Danny Milisavljevic, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy in Purdue University's College of Science. \"This is the most energetic phenomenon I have ever encountered.\"In astronomy, things that are the most luminous are often the most energetic. Milisavljevic, an expert on stellar life cycles\u2014especially star death\u2014noted that the data points to an extremely anomalous observation.The object, like all those observed, was assigned a random name when it was discovered. Its name is ZTF20abrbeie, or, as astronomers affectionately call it, \"Scary Barbie.\" Barbie for its alphanumeric designation and \"scary\" because, Milisavljevic said, \"It's so much of an outlier; its characteristics are terrifying.\"The object is what is known as a transient\u2014something observed in the sky that either appears and then disappears or changes in some dramatic way over the course of hours or days rather than centuries or millennia. In a new paper accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters (and currently available on  the arXiv preprint server), Milisavljevic, his graduate student Bhagya Subrayan, and their team analyzed the data to conclude that the bright, long-lived transient is a black hole in the process of consuming a star. Subrayan's research focuses on big data analysis of sky survey data.\"We think a very supermassive black hole pulled in a star and ripped it apart,\" Subrayan said. \"The forces around a black hole, called tidal disruption, pull other objects apart in a process called 'spaghettification.' We think that's what happened, but on extreme time scales: The most massive of black holes ripping apart a massive star. The duration is unlike anything we've ever seen before, and it produced the most luminous transient in the universe.\"      If Scary Barbie is so bright and so notable, how did it just now come to light, even though datasets indicate the first observations occurred in 2020?It hid in plain sight. While it's bright, it is also extremely far away and in a somewhat neglected corner of the sky. The anomaly was discovered using Milisavljevic's lab's AI engine. The Recommender Engine For Intelligent Transient Tracking (REFITT) combs through observations from a number of telescopes around the world, including those made by the Zwicky Transient Facility using the Palomar Observatory in California.\"REFITT does big data analysis,\" Milisavljevic said. \"It combs through millions of alerts and figures out what interesting things we might want to look at closer. This is a great example. Computers are really good at finding things when we can tell them precisely what to look for. But things like this, anomalous objects, the computer often doesn't even know to look for. It doesn't even have a template. This is so different from anything else we've ever seen that we hadn't even gotten around to trying to classify it. It's been hanging out in the public data for years.\"Once the team and REFITT had identified Scary Barbie as an intriguing opportunity for research, they used data from other telescopes, including the Lick Observatory in California and the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Spectrographic analysis from those telescopes helped the team put a name to the odd phenomenon the data reported.Scary Barbie is not just orders of magnitude brighter and more energetic than any transient scientists have recorded before, but it is also lasting much longer than usual transients do. Most transients last weeks or months, but this one has lasted for more than 800 days\u2014over two years\u2014and latest available data show that it may be visible for years to come.The actual event itself\u2014the spaghettification of this massive star\u2014may be of much shorter duration, but because the transient is so far away the law of relativity slows down the light as it travels to human eyes, making it seem to last nearly twice as long.\"There are few things in the universe that can be so powerful, reactions that can be this long-lived,\" Milisavljevic said. \"Discoveries like this really open our eyes to the fact that we are still uncovering mysteries and exploring wonders in the universe\u2014things no one has ever seen before.\" More information:Bhagya M.

  "text": "When a lander descends toward the moon\u2014or a rocky planet, asteroid, or comet\u2014the exhaust plume of the rocket interacts with the surface, causing erosion and kicking up regolith particles. The resulting blanket of dusty debris can create a dangerous brownout effect, limiting visibility and potentially damaging the spacecraft or nearby equipment.          In the journal Physics of Fluids,, researchers from Chungnam National University, the University of Edinburgh, Gyeongsang National University, and the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information developed a model to describe the interaction between a rocket plume and the surface of a planetary body in near-vacuum conditions. The results can be used to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a proposed landing site and to optimize the design of spacecraft and rocket engines for planetary landings.\"Understanding the interaction between the rocket plume and the surface is important for the safety and success of space missions in terms of contamination and erosion, landing accuracy, planetary protection, and engineering design, as well as for scientific understanding and future exploration,\" said author Byoung Jae Kim of Chungnam National University.The computational framework takes in information about the rocket, its engines, and the surface composition and topography, as well as the atmospheric conditions and gravitational forces at the landing site.By considering the interaction of the gas with solid particles as a system of equations, the simulation estimates the shape and size of the plume, the temperature and pressure of the plume and surface, and the amount of material eroded or displaced. It does so in a way that is more computationally efficient than previous methods.\"Our tool can simulate the plume surface interaction problem at the fundamental level (e.g., scour pattern formation and development of erosion models) and for practical engineering applications (e.g., predicting particle trajectories to avoid damage to the lander and previously established sites and planning descend/ascend scenarios),\" said Kim.In the model, small regolith particles reached high altitudes and caused severe brownout effects during ascent and descent. In contrast, larger particles with increased bed height led to a more favorable brownout status.\"The insights gained from this study of the effects of different parameters on plume-surface interaction can inform the development of more effective and efficient landing technologies,\" said Kim. \"The study also sheds light on the festooned scour patterns that can be observed on planetary surfaces, which can provide valuable information for future scientific investigations of planetary bodies.\"The researchers plan to improve the capabilities of the framework to include more complex physics, such as chemical reactions and solid particle collisions. They believe the model can be applied to other physics scenarios including needle-free drug delivery systems.

  "text": "An international team of astronomers have employed India's AstroSat spacecraft to observe a system of interacting galaxies known as NGC 5291. Results of the observational campaign, published April 6 in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, yield crucial information regarding star-formation activity in this system.          Located some 62 million light years away in the western outskirts of the galaxy cluster Abell 3574, NGC 5291 is an interacting galaxy system consisting of an early type galaxy NGC 5291 and a companion galaxy called \"the Seashell\" interacting with it. The system has extensions or tails, defined by knots, emerging from the galaxy.Previous observations of the NGC 5291 revealed a giant collisional HI (neutral atomic hydrogen) ring structure connected to the system, indicating that the observed knots are star-forming complexes that may even be young tidal dwarf galaxies. Further inspection of the system found that these knots are in fact young tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) formed from the pre-enriched gas in the tidal debris.A group of astronomers led by R. Rakhi of the NSS College in Pandalam, India, decided to take a closer look at the star-forming activity in the knots of NGC 5291. They used AstroSat's Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) to conduct high-resolution ultraviolet imaging observations of the system.\"The main aim of the paper is to identify and characterize the star forming knots in the tidal tails and determine the star formation rates in these knots at the best possible resolution, taking into account dust attenuation of the ultraviolet spectrum,\" the researchers explained.The observations identified a total of 57 star-forming knots that are part of the NGC 5291 interacting system, out of which 12 turned out to be new detections. The sizes of these knots range from 4,500 to 37,000 light years.The astronomers calculated the total extinction-corrected star-formation rate (SFR) of the knots, excluding the NGC 5291 and Seashell galaxies. They found that the knots form stars at a level of approximately 1.75 solar masses per year. The SFR of NGC 5291 and the Seashell galaxy is estimated to be 1.93 and 1.16 solar masses per year, respectively. It was noted that three known tidal dwarf galaxies in the system, located to the north (NGC 5291N), south (NGC 5291S) and south-west (NGC 5291SW), have relatively low SFR values of 0.3, 0.3 and 0.22 solar masses per year, respectively.The researchers compared the SFR of NGC 5291's knots with other dwarf galaxies. They found that many of these knots have SFR values comparable to that of blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies.\"Many of the knots associated with the NGC 5291 system have high SFRs similar to BCD galaxies; this is characteristic of Category 1 TDGs,\" the authors of the paper concluded.

  "question_squad": " What is the region of geospace spanning from 60 to 1000 kilometers above the Earth?",
  "answer_squad": " ionosphere",
  "text": "The ionosphere\u2014the region of geospace spanning from 60 to 1000 kilometers above the Earth\u2014impairs the propagation of radio signals from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) with its electrically charged particles. This is a problem for the ever higher precision required by these systems\u2014both in research and for applications such as autonomous driving or precise orbit determination of satellites.          Models of the ionosphere and its uneven, dynamic charge distribution can help correct the signals for ionospheric delays, which are one of the main error sources in GNSS applications. Researchers led by Artem Smirnov and Yuri Shprits of the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences have presented a new model of the ionosphere in the journal Scientific Reports, developed on the basis of neural networks and satellite measurement data from 19 years.In particular, it can reconstruct the topside ionosphere, the upper, electron-rich part of the ionosphere much more precisely than before. It is thus also an important basis for progress in ionospheric research, with applications in studies on the propagation of electromagnetic waves or for the analysis of certain space weather events, for example.Background: Importance and complexity of the ionosphereThe Earth's ionosphere is the region of the upper atmosphere that extends from about 60 to 1000 kilometers in altitude. Here, charged particles such as electrons and positive ions dominate, caused by the radiation activity of the sun\u2014hence the name. The ionosphere is important for many scientific and industrial applications because the charged particles influence the propagation of electromagnetic waves such as radio signals.The so-called ionospheric propagation delay of radio signals is one of the most important sources of interference for satellite navigation. This is proportional to the electron density in the space traversed. Therefore, a good knowledge of the electron density can help in correcting the signals. In particular, the upper region of the ionosphere, above 600 kilometers, is of interest, since 80 percent of the electrons are gathered in this so-called topside ionosphere.The problem is that the electron density varies greatly\u2014depending on the longitude and latitude above the Earth, the time of day and year, and solar activity. This makes it difficult to reconstruct and predict them, the basis for correcting radio signals, for example.      Previous modelsThere are various approaches to modeling electron density in the ionosphere, among others, the International Reference Ionosphere Model IRI, which has been recognized since 2014. It is an empirical model that establishes a relationship between input and output variables based on the statistical analysis of observations. However, it still has weaknesses in the important area of the topside ionosphere because of the limited coverage of previously collected observations in that region.Recently, however, large amounts of data have become available for this area. Therefore, Machine learning (ML) approaches lend themselves to deriving regularities from this, especially for complex non-linear relationships.Animation of the changing electron density of the Ionosphere around the Earth over three full days: high values in red, low values in blue.

(2023) - Scientific Reports (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-28034-z)New approach using machine learning and neural networksA team from the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences around Artem Smirnov, Ph.D. student and first author of the study, and Yuri Shprits, head of the \"Space Physics and Space Weather\" section and Professor at University Potsdam, took a new ML-based empirical approach.For this, they used data from satellite missions from 19 years, in particular CHAMP, GRACE and GRACE-FO, which were and are significantly co-operated by the GFZ, and COSMIC. The satellites measured\u2014among other things\u2014the electron density in different height ranges of the ionosphere and cover different annual and local times as well as solar cycles.With the help of Neural Networks, the researchers then developed a model for the electron density of the topside ionosphere, which they call the NET model. They used the so-called MLP method (Multi-Layer Perceptrons), which iteratively learns the network weights to reproduce the data distributions with very high accuracy.The researchers tested the model with independent measurements from three other satellite missions.Evaluation of the new model\"Our model is in remarkable agreement with the measurements: It can reconstruct the electron density very well in all height ranges of the topside ionosphere, all around the Globe, at all times of the year and day, and at different levels of solar activity, and it significantly exceeds the International Reference Ionosphere Model IRI in accuracy. Moreover, it covers space continuously,\" first author Artem Smirnov sums up.Yuri Shprits adds, \"This study represents a paradigm shift in ionospheric research because it shows that ionospheric densities can be reconstructed with very high accuracy. The NET model reproduces the effects of numerous physical processes that govern the dynamics of the topside ionosphere and can have broad applications in ionospheric research.\"Possible applications in ionosphere researchThe researchers see possible applications, for instance, in wave propagation studies, for calibrating new electron density data sets with often unknown baseline offsets, for tomographic reconstructions in the form of a background model, as well as to analyze specific space weather events and perform long-term ionospheric reconstructions. Furthermore, the developed model can be connected to plasmaspheric altitudes and thus can become a novel topside option for the IRI.The developed framework allows the seamless incorporation of new data and new data sources. The retraining of the model can be done on a standard PC and can be performed on a regular basis. Overall, the NET model represents a significant improvement over traditional methods and highlights the potential of neural network-based models to provide a more accurate representation of the ionosphere for communication and navigation systems that rely on GNSS.

A blast of superhot material from the sun late last week hurled scorching gases known as plasma toward Earth at nearly 2 million mph (3 million kph), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday.          Earth felt the brunt of the storm Sunday, according to NOAA, with forecasters warning operators of power plants and spacecraft of the potential for disruption.Auroras were reported across parts of Europe and Asia.

  "text": "Scientists observed seismic waves traveling through Mars' core for the first time and confirmed model predictions of the core's composition.          An international research team\u2014which included University of Maryland seismologists\u2014used seismic data acquired by the NASA InSight lander to directly measure properties of Mars's core, finding a completely liquid iron-alloy core with high percentages of sulfur and oxygen. Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on April 24, 2023, these findings reveal new insights into how Mars formed and the geological differences between Earth and Mars that may ultimately play a role in sustaining planetary habitability.\"In 1906, scientists first discovered the Earth's core by observing how seismic waves from earthquakes were affected by traveling through it,\" said UMD Associate Professor of Geology Vedran Lekic, second author of the paper. \"More than a hundred years later, we're applying our knowledge of seismic waves to Mars. With InSight, we're finally discovering what's at the center of Mars and what makes Mars so similar yet distinct from Earth.\"To determine these differences, the team tracked the progression of two distant seismic events on Mars, one caused by a marsquake and the other by a large impact, and detected waves that traveled through the planet's core. By comparing the time it took those waves to travel through Mars compared to waves that stayed in the mantle, and combining this information with other seismic and geophysical measurements, the team estimated the density and compressibility of the material the waves traveled through. The researchers' results indicated that Mars most likely has a completely liquid core, unlike Earth's combination of a liquid outer core and solid inner core.                The InSight mission\u2019s seismometer, though coated by several years of Martian dust, was able to capture recordings of seismic events from the far side of the planet. NASA's InSight Mars lander acquired this image of the area in front of the lander using its lander-mounted, Instrument Context Camera (ICC). Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech             Additionally, the team inferred details about the core's chemical composition, such as the surprisingly large amount of light elements (elements with low atomic numbers)\u2014namely sulfur and oxygen\u2014present in Mars' innermost layer. The team's findings suggested that a fifth of the core's weight is made up of those elements. This high percentage differs sharply from the comparatively lesser weight proportion of light elements in Earth's core, indicating that Mars' core is far less dense and more compressible than Earth's core, a difference that points to different conditions of formation for the two planets.      \"You can think of it this way; the properties of a planet's core can serve as a summary about how the planet formed and how it evolved dynamically over time. The end result of the formation and evolution processes can be either the generation or absence of life-sustaining conditions,\" explained UMD Associate Professor of Geology Nicholas Schmerr, another co-author of the paper. \"The uniqueness of Earth's core allows it to generate a magnetic field that protects us from solar winds, allowing us to keep water. Mars' core does not generate this protective shield, and so the planet's surface conditions are hostile to life.\"Although Mars does not currently have a magnetic field, scientists hypothesize that there was once a magnetic shielding similar to Earth's core-generated field due to traces of magnetism lingering in Mars' crust. Lekic and Schmerr noted that this might mean that Mars gradually evolved to its current conditions, changing from a planet with a potentially habitable environment into an incredibly hostile one. Conditions in the interior play a key role in this evolution, as might violent impacts, according to the researchers.\"It's like a puzzle in some ways,\" Lekic said. \"For example, there are small traces of hydrogen in Mars' core. That means that there had to be certain conditions that allowed the hydrogen to be there, and we have to understand those conditions in order to understand how Mars evolved into the planet it is today.\"The team's findings have ultimately confirmed the accuracy of current modeling estimates that aim to unravel the layers hidden beneath a planet's surface. For geophysicists like Lekic and Schmerr, research like this is also paving the way for future geophysics-oriented expeditions to other celestial bodies, including planets like Venus and Mercury.\"This was a huge effort, involving state-of-the-art seismological techniques which have been honed on Earth, in conjunction with new results from mineral physicists and the insights from team members who simulate how planetary interiors change over time,\" noted Jessica Irving, a senior lecturer at Bristol University and first author of the study. \"But the work paid off, and we now know much more about what's happening inside the Martian core.\"\"Even though the InSight mission ended in December 2022 after four years of seismic monitoring, we're still analyzing the data that was collected,\" Lekic said. \"InSight will continue to influence how we understand the formation and evolution of Mars and other planets for years to come.\" More information:Irving, Jessica C.

  "text": "NASA has finished its planning and is ready to go. Humans will soon be returning to the Moon\u2014this time in a manned base. But, if this project is to succeed, astronauts must be able to grow their own food. Norwegian researchers are in the process of making this possible.          The lunar \"soil,\" or regolith as geologists call it, is essentially a powder in which it is difficult to grow plants. As if this wasn't enough, the moon is characterized by temperatures that can reach 200 degrees during the day and fall to as low as minus 183 degrees at night.So says SINTEF researcher Galina Simonsen. However, in spite of this, Simonsen and her colleagues working as part of the international project LunarPlant, which is being headed by NTNU Social Research and the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Space (CIRiS), believe that it will be possible to grow food plants on the moon.Meeting this challenge requires a rational utilization of available resources, combined with sufficient light and an artificial atmosphere. There is also a need to find a replacement for fertile soil.\"You may already have heard of hydroponics,\" says Simonsen. \"This is a method of growing plants in water, which is entirely possible if the water contains sufficient nutrients. The use of this method is essential to the success of this project,\" she explains.How much water is there on the moon? \"Radar data indicates that the moon's polar regions hold more than 600 billion kilograms of ice,\" says Simonsen, \"This is enough to fill about 240,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. It is much less than we have on Earth, but will be enough to enable humans to maintain some level of activity. The ice will be melted to form water which will be used to cultivate food plants,\" she explains.However, growing plants in water requires that the water contains sufficient nutrients. The \"fertilizer\" that will be utilized on the moon will in fact be provided by the astronauts themselves in the form of human waste\u2014their urine. Because this project is based on the circular use of resources.This is where the term \"liquid gold\" makes its entrance. Gardening enthusiasts among Gemini readers will know that this is the name given to urine diluted in water. Many a flower bed has been brought into bloom thanks to more than a few drops of \"liquid gold.\" However, it is normally not recommended to use urine as a fertilizer for plants intended for human consumption. One of the challenges in this project is to find out how we can use this resource safely.\"Barriers linked to the use of urine as a fertilizer include the strict regulations governing the use of human waste in food plant cultivation,\" explains Simonsen. \"In addition, the handling of human urine is generally unpleasant, combined with the odor and the fact that it releases long-lived organic environmental toxins and trace metals,\" she says.Plants grown in \"liquid gold\" must be analyzed carefully and accurately so that we can identify safe threshold values with a view to approving their use as a food source. Moreover, the plants themselves have to contain sufficient nutrients.\"It may be possible to extract some nutrients for plant growth from the lunar regolith (the lunar soil)\", says Simonsen. \"But these are somewhat meager. Urine can provide nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous. If you are cultivating salad plants, you can also grow other edible plants that can assist with the regulation of both the water quality and nutrient balance in the system,\" she says.      Soil? We only find true soils on EarthAnother aspect of the LunarPlant project is focusing on soil. Or, to be more precise in the case of the moon, the lack of soil. Soil on Earth not only provides nutrients\u2014it is also the habitat in which the plants \"live.\"\"We're trying to find out how we can get the plants to grow without collapsing,\" says Simonsen. \"This involves identifying a growing medium that enables plants to develop a root system that gives them adequate support,\" she says.In order to stand upright, plants prefer to have something solid in which to drive their roots. Currently, rockwool is used by some hydroponic horticulturalists. But rockwool is not a sustainable material, at least not on the moon.\"Sending rockwool to the moon could cost up to NOK 20 million per kilo,\" explains Simonsen. \"For this reason, it is important that we can use a material that is entirely circular. It has to be light and multifunctional. In other words, a material that can first be used for a purpose other than that as a growing medium,\" she says.So, in collaboration with the VTT technical research center in Finland, the researchers have developed a substrate that functions as a supportive collar for the growing plants.The substrate is in fact a cellulose-based alternative to soil and rockwool. The cellulose is produced by plants or, more precisely, from plant waste. The substrate can first be used as insulation material for the secure transport of vital and sensitive equipment that has to be carried from Earth to the moon. On its arrival, it can be reused as a growing medium.So far, the results have been promising.\"We observe that the substrate doesn't break up in the aqueous growing medium. Its components are also plant-friendly and free from any chemicals that may have a negative impact on plant growth or food safety,\" says Simonsen.But does the system have any limitations?\"Yes,\" replies Simonsen. \"Its application is limited to only certain types of plants. Only a few plants can be cultivated hydroponically, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, strawberries and salad vegetables. Others, such as root vegetables, cannot be grown using this method,\" she explains.Learning from the oil industryThe substrate is thus essential, but it is also important to know how the water it contains behaves. For example, some plants do not like \"getting their feet too wet.\"\"The water must not be allowed to stagnate,\" says Simonsen. \"There must always be adequate water flow. Both air and water have to be transported efficiently through the material in order to ensure healthy plant growth. The substrate must be sufficiently robust to support a fully developed plant and at the same time enable the roots to grow unobstructed,\" she says.In order to find out how this happens, the researchers have obtained know-how from the oil industry, and multiphase flow modeling has been shown to be a very useful tool.\"Technologies used for oil and gas transport have proved to be transferable,\" says Simonsen. \"The methods we apply for fluid hydrocarbon transport in major installations can be transferred to the mechanisms working in minute structures such as these plant substrates,\" she says\"Our aim is to construct a digital model that simulates the different factors that influence the behavior of the substrate,\" explains Simonsen. \"This will enable us to run simulations under conditions that are identical to those on the moon, including the effect of weightlessness,\" she says.Can we also use this technology to grow plants in hostile regions on Earth?\"Absolutely,\" says Simonsen. \"This method of cultivation can be applied anywhere, and is particularly important in the context of resource utilization. Urine contains phosphorous, which is a non-renewable resource, and rockwool, which is currently used in a number of situations, is not biodegradable,\" she says.

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the galaxy that is closest to the Milky Way?",
  "answer_squad": " Andromeda",
  "text": "Our galaxy's largest nearby companion is the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a dwarf galaxy visible to the naked eye in the Southern Hemisphere. In recent years, new theoretical research and better observational capabilities have taught astronomers a great deal about our (not-so-little) neighbor. It's becoming increasingly clear that the LMC is helping shape the Milky Way's evolution.          \"It was long assumed that our galaxy lives a quiet life of a hermit, with the nearest 'big' neighbor being Andromeda some 800 kiloparsecs away,\" says Eugene Vasiliev of the University of Cambridge. \"But with the growing realization that the LMC is rather massive, and because of a peculiar 'historical moment' (it just passed near the pericenter of its orbit, where its velocity and the reciprocal effect it imparts on the Milky Way are highest), we can no longer ignore the perturbations to our galaxy that it causes.\"Weighing in at 10%\u201320% the mass of our own galaxy, the LMC is worth taking seriously. Astronomers believe that it's on its first orbit around the Milky Way. Before that orbit began, it was a spiral galaxy in its own right. Interacting with the Milky Way distorted its spiral arms, though it still features a strong central bar as evidence of its previous structure.The Milky Way, too, was changed by the interaction. The stars and stellar streams nearest to the LMC had their orbits deflected, for example, and there were larger, structural changes to the Milky Way too. Because the Milky Way isn't rigid, but rather made up of stars, dust, gas, and rock in varying densities, parts of the galaxy closer to the LMC were affected more than distant parts. The end result was a subtle-but-significant deformation in the shape of the galaxy, especially in the outer regions.Astronomers should be able to see evidence of these changes, but it isn't an easy task. It's difficult to study the shape of our home galaxy, in large part because we can't take a snapshot of the entire Milky Way the way we can of a distant galaxy.\"Living inside our own galaxy is indeed a boon and a bane for an astrophysicist,\" Vasiliev told Universe Today. \"On the one hand, we can measure 3D positions and velocities for millions of stars with high precision, thanks to the Gaia astrometric satellite and numerous complementary ground-based spectroscopic surveys.\" That's something we can only dream of doing with distant galaxies, where we have \"no information about the distribution of stars along the line of sight.\"      On the other hand, the Milky Way blocks our view of much of itself: interstellar dust filters out light in dense regions of the galaxy, hiding information from view. What's more, the furthest reaches of the galaxy are too distant for position and velocity surveys like Gaia to be accurate. Researchers therefore need to rely on models to fill in the gaps: they make predictions about the distant parts of the galaxy based on what we know about the nearer parts.But that makes it hard to see the effects of the LMC on the Milky Way clearly. If there is a small error in the models\u2014even a 5% overestimate of distances, for example\u2014that would distort our picture of the Milky Way and would mask the perturbations caused by the LMC.The fact that it's difficult doesn't mean astronomers are giving up. The LMC's size and proximity mean that its perturbations on our home galaxy ought to be quite significant. But how to find them?                Hubble image of Globular cluster NGC 2808, which was possibly once the core of the Gaia-Enceladus Galaxy. It is believed to have merged with the Milky Way in the distant past. Credit: NASA, ESA, A. Sarajedini (University of Florida) and G. Piotto (University of Padua (Padova)             The answer may lie, in part, in the most recent Gaia data, which showed a peculiar 'striped' pattern in the position and velocity of stars in the Milky Way's galactic halo. The halo is a spherical region that encircles the galactic disk and contains stars at a much lower density than the more populous disk does.These stripe patterns are believed to be the traces left behind by long-dead galaxies that merged with the Milky Way in the ancient past, like the hypothesized Gaia-Enceladus galaxy.When the LMC passed near to the Milky Way in the more recent past, it should have left distortions in those stripes, and that's what astronomers like Vasiliev are hoping to find. The halo is the perfect place to look, because the region's low density makes it more susceptible to changes caused by the LMC's flyby than the inner regions of the galaxy are.In fact, our solar system and the dense regions of the galactic disk are somewhat immune from the LMC's distortions. These areas of the Milky Way are compact, so when the LMC passed by, every star was shifted by the same amount. It wouldn't have left behind any visible distortion.Vasiliev says it helps to think of the LMC's tug on the Milky Way in the same way we think of the Moon's tug on Earth: \"An isolated lake does not have tides,\" he explains, \"but the entire ocean does because the Moon's gravitational force varies across its spatial extent.\"In the same way, we are unlikely to see LMC distortions in our local neighborhood, but across the vast galactic halo, the effects become much more obvious.\"The further out we go, the more important the differential shifts become,\" says Vasiliev.In April, Vasiliev published a review of the current state of knowledge about the LMC's effects on the Milky Way. in the journal Galaxies. While there has been progress in recent years, there is still a lot more to learn, and the new Gaia data is paving the way for better models.As for the future of the Milky Way and the LMC, they are, ultimately, on a collision course. The LMC will merge with the Milky Way in a few billion years, delivering more mass and metallicity to the Milky Way's halo. Of course, this dramatic event will be only a precursor to the even larger merger in store for the Milky Way, as the Andromeda galaxy will, at that point, be on its final approach towards us.If there is a moral to this story, it's that no galaxy is an island. The Milky Way's neighbors are helping to shape its past, present, and future, and astronomers are making an effort to take those effects into account as they study of our home galaxy.

  "text": "A spacecraft around Mars has sent back the most detailed photos yet of the red planet's little moon.          The United Arab Emirates' Amal spacecraft flew within 62 miles (100 kilometers) of Deimos last month and the close-up shots were released Monday. Amal\u2014Arabic for Hope\u2014got a two-for-one when Mars photobombed some of the images. It was the closest a spacecraft has been to Deimos in almost a half-century.The spacecraft also observed the little explored far side of the odd-shaped, cratered moon, just 9 miles by 7 miles by 7 miles (15 kilometers by 12 kilometers by 12 kilometers).Mars' other moon, Phobos, is almost double that size and better understood since it orbits much closer to Mars\u2014just 3,700 miles (6,000 kilometers) away, the closest of any planet's moon in our solar system.Deimos' orbit around Mars stretches 14,000 miles (23,000 kilometers) out. That's close to the inner part of the spacecraft's orbit\u2014\"which is what made observing Deimos such a compelling idea,\" said the mission's lead scientist Hessa al-Matroushi.\"Phobos has got most of the attention up until now\u2014now it's Deimos' turn!\" she added in an email.Al-Matroushi and other scientists with the UAE Space Agency said these new images indicate Deimos is not an asteroid that got captured in Mars' orbit eons ago, the leading theory until now. Instead, they say the the moon appears to be of Martian origin\u2014perhaps from the bigger Martian moon or from Mars itself.The findings were presented Monday at the European Geosciences Union's general assembly in Vienna.Amal will continue to sweep past Deimos this year, but not as closely as the March 10 encounter, according to al-Matroushi.NASA's Viking 2 came within 19 miles (30 kilometers) of Deimos in 1977. Since then, other spacecraft have photographed Deimos but from much farther away.Amal rocketed to Mars on July 19, 2020, one day shy of the 50th anniversary of humanity's first moon landing\u2014Earth's moon, that is\u2014by Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

  "text": "A University of Georgia research team has confirmed evidence of a previously unknown planet outside of our solar system, and they used machine learning tools to detect it.          A recent study by the team showed that machine learning can correctly determine if an exoplanet is present by looking in protoplanetary disks, the gas around newly formed stars.The newly published findings in The Astrophysical Journal represent a first step toward using machine learning to identify previously overlooked exoplanets.\"We confirmed the planet using traditional techniques, but our models directed us to run those simulations and showed us exactly where the planet might be,\" said Jason Terry, doctoral student in the UGA Franklin College of Arts and Sciences department of physics and astronomy and lead author on the study.\"When we applied our models to a set of older observations, they identified a disk that wasn't known to have a planet despite having already been analyzed. Like previous discoveries, we ran simulations of the disk and found that a planet could re-create the observation.\"According to Terry, the models suggested a planet's presence, indicated by several images that strongly highlighted a particular region of the disk that turned out to have the characteristic sign of a planet\u2014an unusual deviation in the velocity of the gas near the planet.\"This is an incredibly exciting proof of concept. We knew from our previous work that we could use machine learning to find known forming exoplanets,\" said Cassandra Hall, assistant professor of computational astrophysics and principal investigator of the Exoplanet and Planet Formation Research Group at UGA. \"Now, we know for sure that we can use it to make brand new discoveries.\"The discovery highlights how machine learning has the power to enhance scientists' work, utilizing artificial intelligence as an added tool to expand researchers' accuracy and more efficiently economize their time when engaged in such a vast endeavor as investigating deep, outer space.The models were able to detect a signal in data that people had already analyzed; they found something that previously had gone undetected.\"This demonstrates that our models\u2014and machine learning in general\u2014have the ability to quickly and accurately identify important information that people can miss. This has the potential to dramatically speed up analysis and subsequent theoretical insights,\" Terry said. \"It only took about an hour to analyze that entire catalog and find strong evidence for a new planet in a specific spot, so we think there will be an important place for these types of techniques as our datasets get even larger.\" More information:J.

  "text": "Every giant was once a baby, though you may never have seen them at that stage of their development. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has begun to shed light on formative years in the history of the universe that have thus far been beyond reach: the formation and assembly of galaxies.          For the first time, a protocluster of seven galaxies has been confirmed at a distance that astronomers refer to as redshift 7.9, or a mere 650 million years after the big bang. Based on the data collected, astronomers calculated the nascent cluster's future development, finding that it will likely grow in size and mass to resemble the Coma Cluster, a monster of the modern universe.\"This is a very special, unique site of accelerated galaxy evolution, and Webb gave us the unprecedented ability to measure the velocities of these seven galaxies and confidently confirm that they are bound together in a protocluster,\" said Takahiro Morishita of IPAC-California Institute of Technology, the lead author of the study published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.The precise measurements captured by Webb's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) were key to confirming the galaxies' collective distance and the high velocities at which they are moving within a halo of dark matter\u2014more than two million miles per hour (about one thousand kilometers per second).The spectral data allowed astronomers to model and map the future development of the gathering group, all the way to our time in the modern universe. The prediction that the protocluster will eventually resemble the Coma Cluster means that it could eventually be among the densest known galaxy collections, with thousands of members.\"We can see these distant galaxies like small drops of water in different rivers, and we can see that eventually they will all become part of one big, mighty river,\" said Benedetta Vulcani of the National Institute of Astrophysics in Italy, another member of the research team.Galaxy clusters are the greatest concentrations of mass in the known universe, which can dramatically warp the fabric of spacetime itself. This warping, called gravitational lensing, can have a magnifying effect for objects beyond the cluster, allowing astronomers to look through the cluster like a giant magnifying glass. The research team was able to utilize this effect, looking through Pandora's Cluster to view the protocluster; even Webb's powerful instruments need an assist from nature to see so far.      Exploring how large clusters like Pandora and Coma first came together has been difficult, due to the expansion of the universe stretching light beyond visible wavelengths into the infrared, where astronomers lacked high-resolution data before Webb. Webb's infrared instruments were developed specifically to fill in these gaps at the beginning of the universe's story.The seven galaxies confirmed by Webb were first established as candidates for observation using data from the Hubble Space Telescope's Frontier Fields program. The program dedicated Hubble time to observations using gravitational lensing, to observe very distant galaxies in detail. However, because Hubble cannot detect light beyond near-infrared, there is only so much detail it can see. Webb picked up the investigation, focusing on the galaxies scouted by Hubble and gathering detailed spectroscopic data in addition to imagery.The research team anticipates that future collaboration between Webb and NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, a high-resolution, wide-field survey mission, will yield even more results on early galaxy clusters. With 200 times Hubble's infrared field of view in a single shot, Roman will be able to identify more protocluster galaxy candidates, which Webb can follow up to confirm with its spectroscopic instruments. The Roman mission is currently targeted for launch by May 2027.\"It is amazing the science we can now dream of doing, now that we have Webb,\" said Tommaso Treu of the University of California, Los Angeles, a member of the protocluster research team. \"With this small protocluster of seven galaxies, at this great distance, we had a one hundred percent spectroscopic confirmation rate, demonstrating the future potential for mapping dark matter and filling in the timeline of the universe's early development.\" More information:Takahiro Morishita et al, Early Results from GLASS-JWST.

  "text": "Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), astronomers from the University of Padua, Italy, and elsewhere have observed a metal-poor globular cluster known as Messier 92. The observations deliver crucial information regarding multiple stellar populations in this cluster. Results were published April 12 on the arXiv pre-print server.          Studies show that almost all globular clusters (GCs) exhibit star-to-star abundance variations of light elements such as helium (He), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), carbon (C) and calcium (Na). This indicates self-enrichment in GCs and suggests that star clusters are composed of at least two stellar populations.Located some 26,700 light years away in the constellation of Hercules, Messier 92 (or M92 for short) is a GC with a metallicity of just -2.31 and a mass of about 200,000 solar masses. The cluster, estimated to be 11.5 billion years old, is known to host at least two stellar generations of stars\u2014named 1G and 2G. Previous studies have found that Messier 92 has an extended 1G sequence, which hosts about 30.4% of cluster stars, and two distinct groups of 2G stars (2GA and 2GB).A team of astronomers led by University of Padua's Tuila Ziliotto decided to inspect these stellar populations of Messier 92, taking advantage of data collected by JWST and HST.\"This paper investigates multiple populations in metal-poor GCs by combining HST and JWST photometry of M 92, a metal-poor GC with [Fe/H]=\u22122.3, with isochrones and synthetic spectra,\" the researchers wrote.The observations identified the three previously reported stellar groups, namely 1G, 2GA and 2GB. These three stellar populations were found to share similar radial distributions of the proper motion dispersion, which range from about 0.2 mas/year near the cluster center to 0.15 mas/year around a distance of about 2.2 half-light radii. Moreover, the 1G, 2GA, and 2GB stars turned out to exhibit isotropic motions in the studied radial interval within about 1.5 half-light radii.Based on the comparison between the observed colors of the cluster stars and the colors derived by synthetic spectra, the astronomers found that helium abundances of 2GA and 2GB stars have higher mass fractions than that of the 1G stars by 0.01 and 0.04, respectively. They noted that helium difference between 2GB and 1G MS stars is consistent with the maximum helium variation inferred for red giant branch (RGB) stars.Furthermore, color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) show that main sequence (MS) stars of Messier 92 fainter than the so-called MS knee (a feature in CMD occurring at the low-mass end of the MS) exhibit an intrinsic color spread, which is present among stars with masses of about 0.1\u20130.4 solar masses. These low-mass stars appear to exhibit a continuous color distribution and do not showcase evidence for distinct groups of 1G and 2G stars.

Repairing the damage from Thursday's unmanned test flight is expected to take months, potentially delaying further launch attempts and slowing the development of a rocket NASA plans to use on its upcoming Moon missions.SpaceX boss Elon Musk had said before the test that just getting Starship in the air without destroying its launch pad would be \"a win.\"Luckily for Musk, the 390-foot-tall (120-meter) rocket successfully lifted off, climbing for about four minutes until it tumbled and exploded, well over the Gulf of Mexico.But SpaceX engineers may have underestimated the damage that Starship's 33 first-stage rocket engines would do.A few days later, the scene around the launch pad is one of desolation, an AFP photographer saw.During takeoff, SpaceX video showed a hail of debris being blasted as far as the Gulf of Mexico, over 1,400 feet (420 meters) away. According to local press reports, a cloud of dust floated over a small town several miles (kilometers) away.Photos of the launch site show the gigantic launch tower still standing while the rocket mount, which supports Starship before liftoff, damaged but still intact.                The launch of the Starship rocket on April 20, 2023 sent a huge cloud of dust and debris into the air around the Texas launch site.             Beneath it, however, lies a huge crater, images posted on social media showed.\"The force of the engines when they throttled up may have shattered the concrete, rather than simply eroding it,\" Musk conceded Saturday on Twitter\u2014another company in his portfolio.A delay of monthsOlivier de Weck, a professor of astronautics and engineering at MIT, told AFP that \"the radius of debris and disturbance was probably bigger than anybody anticipated.\"\"The main damage to the launch pad is underneath, where the flames impinge on the ground,\" he told AFP, adding that repairing the crater \"will take several months.\"De Weck said that Starship's launch site, unlike others used for such large rockets, lacked a \"water deluge system.\"Those are used to flood the pad with water, cooling it and absorbing shock and sound waves.                This photo shows a crater blasted by the takeoff of the Starship rocket.             The Texas site also lacks what is known as a flame trench\u2014tunnels which channel hot exhaust away from the pad.Such features come at a high price though, particularly when they have to stand up to the earth-shaking power of Starship.After Thursday's test, Musk said that SpaceX had begun building \"a massive water-cooled steel plate to go under the launch mount.\"But it \"wasn't ready in time,\" and engineers \"wrongly\" calculated that the pad could still withstand the test.Known for audacious goal-setting, Musk estimates that a next launch attempt could be carried out as soon as \"one to two months.\"      Melting steelScientist Philip Metzger, who previously worked for NASA on launch pad physics, said he thought the steel plate plan could have been \"a good solution.\"\"The problem,\" he added, \"is that this is such a large rocket and it takes so long to get off the pad,\" that the heat from the rocket's 33 engines \"possibly could melt the steel.\"                A chunk of twisted metal lies on the ground near the Starship's launch site.             That could be solved by pumping water through channels in the steel, \"so long as they have a high enough flow rate,\" said Metzger, now a professor at the University of Central Florida.He said the approach would not entirely solve the problem of shock waves, but he believes it's possible Starship has been designed to be solid enough to survive.Designing a launch pad, Metzger told AFP, can be just as complicated as developing a rocket.The maiden launch in November of NASA's new mega-rocket, the SLS, also caused damage to its launch pad in Florida, notably knocking launch-tower elevators out of service.Before its next test flight, SpaceX will need to determine the exact problems behind Thursday's test.In video broadcast by the company, several of Starship's 33 engines appeared to malfunction.The rocket's two stages also did not separate as planned, forcing SpaceX to trigger a self-destruct mechanism.                Members of the public walk through a debris field near the SpaceX launch pad on April 22, 2023.             The private aerospace firm will also have to persuade the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to authorize a new flight, noted de Weck.The US agency, which is leading an investigation into the explosion, has confirmed that no injuries resulted from Thursday's test. It has said that no new tests will be approved if there is any threat to public safety.De Weck echoed Musk's evaluation of the trial, calling it \"more a success than a failure.\"\"The reason they're achieving these incredible capabilities,\" the MIT professor continued, \"is because they are willing to take risks and break things.\"But they learn from it, and improve very, very quickly.\"    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Giant SpaceX rocket leaves crater, serious damage at Texas base (2023, April 24)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-giant-spacex-rocket-crater-texas.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "To sit under the vast expanse of stars is to imagine swimming across shining, stellar rivers, creeks and tributaries. But to sit here also is to feel that lump in your throat and skip in your heart, realizing everything you know is far smaller than the majesty of the universe.          You could sense all of that during a recent stargazing party at the University of Texas at Austin's McDonald Observatory, nestled high in the Davis Mountains. On a cool spring evening, dozens gathered at the edge of dusk, some walking with the help of a cane, others holding hands.Comforted by the celestial canopy, a young couple embraced and kissed. Near them, a father and his young daughter waited to peer through a giant telescope that stood tall and fierce like a rocket ready for liftoff. The father pointed to what he thought might be the Pleiades star cluster\u2014or maybe some other planet in the Milky Way.The visitors came to this vantage point, about 6,800 feet above sea level\u2014some from as far away as Norway, India and Chihuahua, Mexico. In hushed, reverent tones, they spoke in their native languages as they wandered around several telescopes.All gaped in wonder as the mountain air turned chilly and the colors above faded from bright orange to pale pink. All waited in keen anticipation for any hint of what they might find beyond the known universe.Here, astronomers and conservationists are fighting against the encroaching light of towns and industries, the kind of thing that humankind and progress bring. It's a campaign to maintain one of the world's largest dark sky reserves, which happens to grace the state of Texas.\"The Greater Big Bend region of Texas and Mexico is fortunate to be one of the darkest remaining areas in North America,\" said Stephen C. Hummel, chairman of the reserve and Dark Skies Initiative coordinator at McDonald Observatory.\"An uninterrupted view of the Milky Way,\" he said, \"is as integrally tied to the identity of the region as the mountains, flora and fauna.\"'Matt Damon is not up there'At the stargazing party, Tommy Lepori, long hair spilling down to his waist, adjusted his safari hat and smiled at all the, well, starstruck visitors.He informed everyone they had not identified the Pleiades, but instead located Mars.\"It's not a red planet; it's a rust planet\u2026 due to the oxidization of the iron content on the surface there,\" said Lepori, 28, a telescope operator at the party. \"And, no, Matt Damon is not up there,\" he said, referring to the Hollywood actor's role in \"The Martian.\"Laughter erupted.Far West Texas is the heart of the Greater Big Bend International Dark Sky Reserve, an ambitious initiative to create one of the world's largest sky reserves free of light pollution.The initiative seeks to educate governments, businesses and residents about the importance of reducing light pollution and nurturing darker skies, which can help generate tourism.The initiative, approved in 2022, spans this binational region, including the northern Mexican states of Chihuahua and Coahuila encircled by stunning desert beauty. The area spans the magnificent Rio Grande, which, along with the blanket of stars, ignores the border between countries.The effort, spearheaded by the McDonald Observatory, involves four counties in Texas plus a protected area in Northern M\u00e9xico, to create more than 15,000 square miles in parts of western Texas and northern Mexico, much of it desert and rugged terrain.Funding comes from the McDonald Observatory, which is supported by multiple private, state, federal and educational sources.It is the only such reserve to straddle an international border, and serves as a magnet for astronomers, conservationists and lovers of nature's cosmic mysteries.      Pollution-free skiesThe Texas Chapter of International Dark-Sky Association, a volunteer educational group, recently rebranded itself as DarkSky Texas to coincide with the annual International Dark Sky Week, April 15-22, to generate awareness of the importance of promoting \"pollution-free skies,\" said Soll Sussman, board member of the DarkSky Texas.Sussman said meetings are held the first Wednesday of every month with Texas communities to promote awareness. A DarkSky Texas delegation will be in Dallas during EarthX's Earth Day Expo 2023, April 21-23.The McDonald Observatory, DarkSky Texas and other entities have long pushed for the creation of the reserve, arguing that the designation would protect astronomers' research while also supporting unspoiled refuge for outdoor tourism, the economic lifeline of these sparsely populated counties.The West Texas region, from the Midland-Odessa area to Sierra Blanca and El Paso, is threatened by light pollution, which is defined by experts like Hummel as unwanted, artificial lighting.The sources of the light include the oil and gas industry in the Permian Basin and an immigration detention center in Sierra Blanca.\"Too many people associate security with light, and that's not what we need,\" Sussman said.Educating communitiesShelley Bernstein is executive director of the Big Bend Conservation Alliance, a nonprofit that promotes the conservation of water, dark skies and cultural heritage.One of her passions is promoting the importance of dark skies to surrounding communities in the counties of Jeff Davis, Presidio and Alpine.She visits city council meetings, businesses and neighbors and explains the importance of swapping \"mercury vapor light\" for \"LEDs under 2500 Kelvin,\" she said.\"McDonald Observatory is the leader,\" she said. \"They know all the science. What we know is the community. So what we did is [we] mapped a very specific kind of light that creates some of the worst kind of light pollution. You see the difference at night when these skies turn dark and beautiful. And it's economical, too.\"A study by the International Dark-Sky Association, founded in 1988 to increase awareness about light pollution, estimates light pollution costs Americans an estimated $2.2 billion a year nationwide, because it wastes energy.The reserve designation guidelines called for local governments across the Big Bend region to adopt stricter outdoor lighting rules. That's not as easy as it sounds, conservationists like Bernstein and Sussman say.The designation itself is largely symbolic as groups overseeing the reserves have no regulatory power. Still, the benefits have far-reaching ramifications for the population in the region and beyond.Light pollution prevents nearly 80% of North Americans from seeing the Milky Way in the night sky, according to a research study published in the journal Science Advances.Moreover, Hummel said, \"light pollution grew at an average rate of 10% per year in the past decade in North America, far faster than the rate of population growth.\"Since the reserve's designation, the night sky became 3% darker, a sign that light pollution is reversible with simple changes, Hummel said.ParadiseUp the road, some 30 miles from Marfa, lies Fort Davis.There, inside a small one-story house lives Peter Armstrong, an avid photographer of the skies. Armstrong believes he's found the closest thing to paradise, right in his backyard facing north toward the McDonald Observatory.The observatory is where he volunteered one summer and \"hung out right where Carl Sagan and Albert Einstein stood,\" he said.Armstrong, 78, who is legally blind, is retired and a self-described \"gadget guy.\" He uses a telescope to see the images on a giant computer screen.A veteran software expert, he fixes computers on the side, though most of his time is taken up by his fascination with what's beyond the earth's atmosphere.\"Most people\u2026 only have to take one good look at Saturn through a decent telescope and they'll be hooked,\" he said. \"Saturn is such a beautiful planet if you [have] good seeing conditions and have a decent telescope.\"A few miles away, after a steep climb up the Davis Mountains, star-gazers flocked in awe of giant telescopes pointing toward space. They gathered at the McDonald Observatory, waiting.Dusk faded, moving from shades of pink and blue to a deep cobalt.Lepori, the telescope operator, stood a few feet away from the crowd and loved what he saw.\"It's going to be a great night,\" he said. He can't wait for summer to come, when the crowds will grow larger\u2014and the skies darker.

  "text": "A research team led by the researcher Wang Jian from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), collaborating with the Polar Research Institute of China, developed the Near-Infrared Sky Brightness Monitor (NISBM) for measurements at DOME A. Their work was published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS) on March 21.       The Antarctic, with its unparalleled climate and geographical conditions, is considered to be the best candidate for observing infrared bands on Earth. Despite the extreme conditions of low temperature, high altitude, low pressure, and power difficulties of Dome A in Antarctica, Wang's team completed the NISBM for Dome A in 2018 with the advantage of InGaAs detector in J, H, and Ks bands.Researchers carefully analyzed the preliminary Antarctic observations obtained by NISBM for Dome A and concluded that when the solar altitude angle decreases to a specific inflection point, the background intensity of the sky in this band will no longer be influenced by the sun. By calculating and analyzing the zenith angle data, the sky background intensity of Antarctic Dome A in J, H, and Ks bands are 600 ~ 1100 \u03bcJy arcsec-2, 1100 ~ 2600 \u03bcJy arcsec-2, 200~900 \u03bcJy arcsec-2, respectively.Compared with the stations at low latitudes and high altitudes, DOME A has a significantly lower brightness in the Ks band, which is comparable to the South Pole. This indicates that DOME A is an excellent site for Ks-band astronomical observations.

  "answer_squad": " the Atacama Cosmology Telescope",
  "text": "In the 1960s, astronomers began noticing a pervasive microwave background visible in all directions. Thereafter known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the existence of this relic radiation confirmed the Big Bang theory, which posits that all matter was condensed onto a single point of infinite density and extreme heat that began expanding ca. 13.8 billion years ago.          By measuring the CMB for redshift and comparing these to local distance measurements (using variable stars and supernovae), astronomers have sought to measure the rate at which the universe is expanding.Around the same time, scientists observed that the rotational curves of galaxies were much higher than their visible mass suggested. This meant that either Einstein's Theory of General Relativity was wrong or the universe was filled with a mysterious, invisible mass.In a new series of papers, members of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration have used background light from the CMB to create a new map of Dark Matter distribution that covers a quarter of the sky and extends deep into the cosmos. This map confirms General Relativity and its predictions for how mass alters the curvature of spacetime.The ACT is an international consortium of more than 160 scientists from the U.S., the U.K., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Chile, Switzerland, Japan, South Africa, and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.Their goal is to provide improved measurements of parameters that describe the very early universe by monitoring the light that emerged during \"Cosmic Dawn\" (when the universe was only 380,000 years old), which is visible today as the CMB. By comparing this to measurements of the local universe, astronomers and cosmologists hope to learn more about how it evolved.According to the predominant cosmological model\u2014the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) model\u2014Dark Matter accounts for 85% of the mass in the cosmos. Unfortunately, it doesn't interact with normal (\"luminous\") matter via electroweak or strong nuclear forces, only gravity (the weakest of the fundamental forces). To track down this illusive and \"invisible\" mass, the ACT collaboration uses the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), a custom-built six-meter (~20-foot) millimeter-wave telescope located at the Llano de Chajnantor Observatory in northern Chile.                The Big Bang (left), the wavy lines illustrate the distortion; the warped light received by the ACT (right); the new Dark Matter map (lower left). Credit: Lucy Reading-Ikkanda/Simons Foundation/ACT Collaboration             As they describe in their three new papers scheduled for publication in The Astrophysical Journal, the team relied on data from the ACT's Data Release 6 (DR6), which consisted of five seasons of CMB temperature and polarization observations. These light readings were essentially used to backlight all of the matter between the present day and the Big Bang (ca. 13.8 billion years ago). Said Suzanne Staggs, the Henry DeWolf Smyth Professor of Physics at Princeton University and the director of ACT:      \"It's a bit like silhouetting, but instead of just having black in the silhouette, you have texture and lumps of dark matter, as if the light were streaming through a fabric curtain that had lots of knots and bumps in it. The famous blue and yellow CMB image is a snapshot of what the universe was like in a single epoch, about 13 billion years ago, and now this is giving us the information about all the epochs since.\"The image alluded to here is the famous full-sky image based on data collected by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) between 2001 and 2003. This mission (which remained in operation until 2010) built on the previous work by the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), which collected data on the CMB from 1989 to 1993.Then came the ESA's Planck satellite, which measured the CMB from 2009 to 2013 to map tiny temperature fluctuations. The increasingly accurate maps that resulted have provided insight into the evolution of the cosmos by showing what its initial conditions were.This latest map has taken that research a step further by using it to measure how the structure of matter has evolved since, 85% of which is Dark Matter. To visualize the presence and distribution of this mysterious mass, the research team examined how its gravity affected the curvature of spacetime between the CMB and Earth. This effectively showed how large collections of mass (both visible and invisible) altered the path its light followed as it traveled for billions of light-years (and billions of years) to reach us.                The full-sky image of the temperature fluctuations in the CMB made from nine years of WMAP observations. These are the seeds of galaxies from when the Universe was under 400,000 years old. Credit: NASA/WMAP             The team tracked how the gravitational pull of massive dark matter structures can warp the CMB on its 14-billion-year journey to us, just as antique, lumpy windows bend and distort what we can see through them. The resulting map revealed the \"scaffold\" of Dark Matter that holds visible matter and surrounds and connects galaxies and galaxy clusters.This led to the universe's large-scale structure (often referred to as the \"Cosmic Web\"), which can be seen clearly in the image. The map also breaks with convention by measuring the distribution of matter in our universe, not in terms of light but in terms of mass.Said co-author Blake Sherwin, a 2013 Ph.D. alumnus of Princeton and a professor of cosmology at the University of Cambridge (where he leads the ACT research group):\"We have mapped the invisible dark matter distribution across the sky, and it is just as our theories predict. This is stunning evidence that we understand the story of how structure in our universe formed over billions of years, from just after the Big Bang to today. Remarkably, 80% of the mass in the universe is invisible. By mapping the dark matter distribution across the sky to the largest distances, our ACT lensing measurements allow us to clearly see this invisible world.\"\"We've made a new mass map using distortions of light left over from the Big Bang,\" said Princeton assistant professor Mathew Madhavacheril, a 2016-2018 Princeton postdoc and a lead author of one of the papers. \"Remarkably, it provides measurements that show that both the 'lumpiness' of the universe, and the rate at which it is growing after 14 billion years of evolution, are just what you'd expect from our standard model of cosmology based on Einstein's theory of gravity.\"                A simple checkerboard pattern representing the CMB (left) warped by intervening mass (purple) to create the distorted image on the right (received by the ACT). Credit: Lucy Reading-Ikkanda/Simons Foundation             Mark Devlin, the Reese Flower Professor of Astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania and the deputy director of ACT, was one of a handful of researchers who saw the potential for this experiment back in the early 2000s. \"When we proposed this experiment in 2003, we had no idea the full extent of information that could be extracted from our telescope,\" he said. \"We owe this to the cleverness of the theorists, the many people who built new instruments to make our telescope more sensitive, and the new analysis techniques our team came up with.\"Their results could also provide new insight into the so-called \"Crisis in Cosmology,\" where light measurements using the CMB vs. local stars produce different values. Also known as the \"Hubble Tension,\" this disparity suggests that Dark Matter was not \"lumpy\" enough and that the standard model of cosmology (LCDM) may be incorrect. However, the ACT team's latest results precisely assessed the size and distribution of these lumps and determined that they were perfectly consistent with the LCDM model. Staggs, whose team built the detectors that gathered the data over the past five years, believes their new map could turn this \"crisis\" into an opportunity:\"The CMB is famous already for its unparalleled measurements of the primordial state of the universe, so these lensing maps, describing its subsequent evolution, are almost an embarrassment of riches. We now have a second, very primordial map of the universe. Instead of a 'crisis,' I think we have an extraordinary opportunity to use these different data sets together. Our map includes all of the dark matter, going back to the Big Bang, and the other maps are looking back about 9 billion years, giving us a layer that is much closer to us. We can compare the two to learn about the growth of structures in the universe. I think is going to turn out to be really interesting. That the two approaches are getting different measurements is fascinating.\"While the ACT was decommissioned in September 2022 (after 15 years in operation), the data it gathered still inspire new research and breakthroughs. More papers presenting results from the final set of observations in the DR6 are expected soon, and the Simons Observatory will conduct future observations from the same sight. These will be done using a new telescope scheduled to begin operations in 2024 that will be capable of mapping the sky almost ten times as fast as the ACT. Perhaps we can look forward to all-sky surveys that map the distribution of Dark Matter going back to the beginning of the cosmos.The three papers are published on the arXiv preprint server.

  "answer_squad": " Bath Physics Observatory",
  "text": "A low-cost, high-value observatory with a passing resemblance to a garden shed has been set up in the grounds of the University of Bath. The observatory is proving to be a game-changing experimental tool for undergraduates studying events in space, say lecturers at the university.          The timber cabin\u2014located on the university campus and designed to give astrophysics students hands-on experience observing objects in the night-sky\u2014was built and equipped for under \u00a335,000, thanks in part to a generous donation from Bath alumni.Academics involved in the construction project are now urging all universities offering courses in astrophysics to consider investing in a similar structure, as a way to bring the subject to life for students who would otherwise learn about stars and deep space almost entirely from lectures and textbooks.The Bath facility\u2014which is described in a paper published in the journal Physics Education\u2014sports a roll-off roof, two high-quality, computer-controlled telescopes and solar panels, and can accommodate two people at a time. Students use their time in the observatory to gather data that ties into specific science projects or modules on their courses.The four authors of the Bath Physics Observatory (BPO) paper, all academics in the Department of Physics at Bath who lecture on astrophysics, are coordinator Dr. Peter Sloan, science lead Dr. Vicky Scowcroft, technical lead Dr. Steve Davies and public engagement lead Dr. Gary Mathlin.Dr. Sloan said, \"We now have over 125 students enrolled on astrophysics programs, what was missing was the facility\u2014an observatory\u2014to perform hands-on observational astrophysics.\"For some of our students, there's a disconnect between what they learn in lecture theaters and what is happening above them in the sky. The observatory gives them a chance to see where their data\u2014star-light\u2014comes from. They still do hard science with the data they capture in the observatory, but a project becomes a lot more real and exciting when calculations come directly from what is observed and photographed through a telescope.\"Before construction of the observatory, students gathered data in a lot less comfort. \"We'd set up a collapsible camping table for students to make their observational measurements. By the time they'd finished their night's work, they had ice on their jackets,\" said Dr. Scowcroft.      An important objective in providing an observatory was to make star-gazing less elitist. Explaining, Dr. Scowcroft said, \"Some of our students have grown up with expensive telescopes in their homes, so they have an obvious advantage when they get to university. We want to make the experience of observing the stars democratic and accessible to all.\"Dr. Davies added, \"We have shown that with the advent of moderate-cost, high-quality, 'back-garden' astronomy, and standard computers powerful enough to produce original research, it's possible to build a small observatory capable of actual astrophysical research for a modest budget.\"Dr. Mathlin said, \"Around 35 universities in the U.K. have their own observatories but many others don't\u2014we'd highly encourage all places that teach astrophysics to set one up.\"Fred Caudwell, a fourth-year physics student at Bath who focuses on astrophysics, said, \"A lot of astrophysics at university is about sitting in lectures and solving problems that you've been given by your tutors\u2014the observatory is what brings the subject to life.\"He added that he could not have undertaken his Master's degree research project on variable stars (a type of star that fluctuates in brightness) without use of the observatory.\"I needed to use a telescope to get the necessary measurements for my project but large telescopes in dedicated facilities are extremely expensive and in high demand, so students generally do not have access to them. So the campus observatory was a necessity for me,\" he said.Lucy Sparkes, who has completed the second year of her undergraduate degree in Physics with Astrophysics and is now on a year-long industrial placement, said, \"As well as being fun, using the observatory equipment last year gave me a more practical understanding of how astronomy is done.\"It was good to be able to set up the telescope during the day, take calibration images at night and then use these images of variable stars and analyze the data I'd captured using Python (a computer programming language).

  "question_squad": " What is the mass of a pre-ELM WD?",
  "answer_squad": " 0.09 solar masses",
  "text": "A binary system containing an extremely low-mass (ELM) white dwarf (WD) progenitor and a compact invisible companion, was discovered by Chinese astronomers from the National Astronomical Observatories of Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC), using spectroscopic data from LAMOST and P200/DBSP, and multi-band photometric data from Catalina and Zwicky Transient Facility.          The mass of the visible star, a pre-ELM WD, is about 0.09 solar masses, lower than the theoretical limit of its species, and may challenge the current formation theory of the ELM WD.The study has been published in The Astronomical Journal.Most stars in the universe will end their lives as white dwarfs after their nuclear fuel were burned out. Most of the white dwarfs are carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WD), which means they are mostly composed of Carbon and Oxygen. They have masses of 0.5-1.4 solar masses.When the mass is greater than 1.4 solar masses, the electron degeneracy pressure at the core cannot resist the gravity and the white dwarf will continue to collapse into a neutron star. White dwarfs between 0.33 and 0.5 solar masses can have cores dominated by either CO or Helium (He). White dwarfs with even lower masses, known as ELM WDs, are composed of degenerate He.It is believed that these ELM WDs cannot form via the single star evolution channel, since the formation of such single low mass He WDs requires a progenitor star with a correspondingly very low initial mass and an extremely long evolution time, a time even longer than the current age of our universe. Therefore, it is generally accepted that ELMs are formed within interacting binary systems.In particular, it is proposed that the even lower mass fraction of ELMs (below 0.18 solar masses) loses most of its initial mass via a stable Roche Lobe overflow channel.To successfully form an ELM, the onset of the mass transfer should be at the right time. If the mass transfer starts too early, the donor will evolve into a low-mass main sequence star, similar to the secondary in the Cataclysmic Variable.On the other hand, if it starts too late, the core of the donor will be massive enough to evolve to the next stage by helium flash. Thus, there is a theoretical lower mass limit of the ELM-WD in such a restricted mass transfer process, which is about 0.14-0.16 solar masses.\"The special pre-ELM-WD looks like a normal F-type dwarf star orbiting an invisible component every 5.27 hours. It may have just completed its mass-transfer phase and is moving slowly towards the white dwarf cooling path. Its constant luminosity implies that its energy is supplied by a tiny burning hydrogen shell outside the degenerate He core. However, its dynamical mass is only about 0.09 solar masses, below the lower limit of theoretical predictions, which is indeed puzzling,\" said Dr. Yuan Hailong, first author of the study.The mass of the system is estimated based on multi-band time-domain photometric and spectroscopic data and Gaia parallax. After taking into account all error budgets, the estimated mass is still significantly low. The team has tested several theoretical models, none of which could fit the results properly. This discovery raises a question about the current ELM formation mechanism that is still awaiting an answer.The invisible compact component could have a mass of ~1.0M\u2609, and is more likely to be a WD, but a neutron star cannot be ruled out at present.The ELM binary systems with compact companions may be continuous gravitational wave sources and are among the most revealing objects in the gravitational wave detection project.As an important progress of the LAMOST compact object search project, the discovery proves the ability of LAMOST to study the ELMs. With more time-domain plates coming in during LAMOST's second regular five-year survey, more interesting compact binary systems are expected to be discovered.

  "text": "A team of oceanographers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, working with a colleague from Chungnam National University and another from the University of Hawaii, has mapped 19,000 previously unknown undersea volcanoes in the world's oceans using radar satellite data. In their paper published in the journal Earth and Space Science, the group describes how they used radar satellite data to measure seawater mounding to find and map undersea volcanoes and explains why it is important that it be done.          The ocean floor, like dry land masses, features a wide variety of terrain. And as with dry land, features that truly stand out are mountains\u2014in the ocean they are called seamounts. And as on land, they can be created by tectonic plates pushing against one another, or by volcanos erupting. Currently, just one-fourth of the sea floor has been mapped, which means that no one knows how many seamounts exist, or where they might be. This can be a problem for submarines\u2014twice U.S. submarines have collided with seamounts, putting such vehicles and their crew at risk. But not knowing where the seamounts are located presents another problem. It prevents oceanographers from creating models depicting the flow of oceanwater around the world.In this new effort, the research team set themselves the task of discovering and mapping as many seamounts as possible, and to do it, they used data from radar satellites. Such satellites cannot actually see the seamounts, of course, instead they measure the altitude of the sea surface, which changes due to changes in gravitational pull related to seafloor topography; an effect known as sea mounding. In so doing, they found 19,000 previously unknown seamounts.In their paper, the team notes that other important reasons for mapping the ocean floor include things like assisting with sea-floor mining efforts\u2014seamounts harbor vast amounts of rare-earth minerals. More complete seamount maps would also help geologists better map the planet's tectonic plates and geomagnetic field. Also, some seamounts provide a habitant for a vast array of marine life.But most importantly, they have a very strong impact on deep-sea ocean flow. As currents run into seamounts, they are pushed upward, carrying colder water with them, and mix in unknown ways. Mapping such currents has become more important as the oceans absorb more heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and freshwater melt, due to ongoing climate change.

  "answer_squad": " axions",
  "text": "Physicists believe most of the matter in the universe is made up of an invisible substance that we only know about by its indirect effects on the stars and galaxies we can see.          We're not crazy! Without this \"dark matter\", the universe as we see it would make no sense.But the nature of dark matter is a longstanding puzzle. However, a new study by Alfred Amruth at the University of Hong Kong and colleagues, published in Nature Astronomy, uses the gravitational bending of light to bring us a step closer to understanding.Invisible but omnipresentThe reason we think dark matter exists is that we can see the effects of its gravity in the behavior of galaxies. Specifically, dark matter seems to make up about 85% of the universe's mass, and most of the distant galaxies we can see appear to be surrounded by a halo of the mystery substance.But it's called dark matter because it doesn't give off light, or absorb or reflect it, which makes it incredibly difficult to detect.So what is this stuff? We think it must be some kind of unknown fundamental particle, but beyond that we're not sure. All attempts to detect dark matter particles in laboratory experiments so far have failed, and physicists have been debating its nature for decades.Scientists have proposed two leading hypothetical candidates for dark matter: relatively heavy characters called weakly interacting massive particles (or WIMPs), and extremely lightweight particles called axions. In theory, WIMPs would behave like discrete particles, while axions would behave a lot more like waves due to quantum interference.It has been difficult to distinguish between these two possibilities\u2014but now light bent around distant galaxies has offered a clue.Gravitational lensing and Einstein ringsWhen light traveling through the universe passes a massive object like a galaxy, its path is bent because\u2014according to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity\u2014the gravity of the massive object distorts space and time around itself.As a result, sometimes when we look at a distant galaxy we can see distorted images of other galaxies behind it. And if things line up perfectly, the light from the background galaxy will be smeared out into a circle around the closer galaxy.This distortion of light is called \"gravitational lensing\", and the circles it can create are called \"Einstein rings\".By studying how the rings or other lensed images are distorted, astronomers can learn about the properties of the dark matter halo surrounding the closer galaxy.Axions vs. WIMPsAnd that's exactly what Amruth and his team have done in their new study. They looked at several systems where multiple copies of the same background object were visible around the foreground lensing galaxy, with a special focus on one called HS 0810+2554.Using detailed modeling, they worked out how the images would be distorted if dark matter were made of WIMPs vs. how they would if dark matter were made of axions. The WIMP model didn't look much like the real thing, but the axion model accurately reproduced all features of the system.The result suggests axions are a more probable candidate for dark matter, and their ability to explain lensing anomalies and other astrophysical observations has scientists buzzing with excitement.Particles and galaxiesThe new research builds on previous studies that have also pointed towards axions as the more likely form of dark matter. For example, one study looked at the effects of axion dark matter on the cosmic microwave background, while another examined the behavior of dark matter in dwarf galaxies.Although this research won't yet end the scientific debate over the nature of dark matter, it does open new avenues for testing and experiment. For example, future gravitational lensing observations could be used to probe the wave-like nature of axions and potentially measure their mass.A better understanding of dark matter will have implications for what we know about particle physics and the early universe. It could also help us to understand better how galaxies form and change over time.

  "text": "Scientists from Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) led a team in the unique Citizen Continental-America Telescopic Eclipse (CATE) experiment to image the Sun's outer atmosphere, the corona, during a short solar eclipse on the opposite side of the Earth. Using four platforms in the northwest corner of Australia, the team successfully observed the million-degree solar corona at the April 20 eclipse viewed from the Exmouth peninsula. The Australian eclipse serves both as a unique scientific opportunity and a training exercise for the program's leadership in preparation for the 2024 U.S. eclipse.          The CATE 2024 team traveled nearly 10,000 miles for one minute of totality to observe the Sun's corona from the unique perspective offered by total solar eclipses. These phenomena allow scientists to view the complex and dynamic outer atmosphere in ways that aren't possible or practical by any other means, opening new windows into our understanding of the solar corona. SwRI is leading the Citizen CATE 2024 experiment, a broad scientific outreach initiative that will make a continuous 60-minute high-resolution movie during the April 8, 2024, solar eclipse over the United States. CATE 2024 will use a network of 35 teams of citizen scientists representing the local communities within the eclipse shadow path.\"Even though this was a very short eclipse, our team of community scientists performed flawlessly and captured fabulous images of the structure of the elusive solar corona,\" said Dr. Amir Caspi, a principal scientist at SwRI in Boulder, Colorado, and leader of the CATE 2024 project.The observations obtained by the team will allow scientists to study the complexities of the Sun's corona including its complicated shape, how it changes over time, or what causes the corona to reach temperatures of millions of degrees Fahrenheit. Today's images from Australia will also help the team to refine its experimental procedures for the immense, distributed community effort in the United States next year.                A team of researchers from SwRI, NSO, NCAR, the University of Northern Colorado, Rice University, the University of Indiana, and the University of Maine observed a rare hybrid eclipse April 20 from four platforms in the Exmouth Peninsula, as the eclipse tracked through parts of Australia and Indonesia.

  "text": "Astronomers using data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and other telescopes have identified a new threat to life on planets like Earth: a phase during which intense X-rays from exploded stars can affect planets over 100 light-years away. This result, as outlined in our latest press release, has implication for the study of exoplanets and their habitability.          This newly found threat comes from a supernova's blast wave striking dense gas surrounding the exploded star, as depicted in the upper right of our artist's impression. When this impact occurs it can produce a large dose of X-rays that reaches an Earth-like planet (shown in the lower left, illuminated by its host star out of view to the right) months to years after the explosion and may last for decades. Such intense exposure may trigger an extinction event on the planet.A new study reporting this threat is based on X-ray observations of 31 supernovae and their aftermath\u2014mostly from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, Swift and NuSTAR missions, and ESA's XMM-Newton\u2014show that planets can be subjected to lethal doses of radiation located as much as about 160 light-years away. Four of the supernovae in the study (SN 1979C, SN 1987A, SN 2010jl, and SN 1994I) are shown in composite images containing Chandra data in the supplemental image.The paper describing this result appears in the April 20, 2023 issue of The Astrophysical Journal.                Illustration of an Earth-like planet before and after radiation exposure. Credit: NASA/CXC/M. Weiss             Prior to this, most research on the effects of supernova explosions had focused on the danger from two periods: the intense radiation produced by a supernova in the days and months after the explosion, and the energetic particles that arrive hundreds to thousands of years afterward.If a torrent of X-rays sweeps over a nearby planet, the radiation could severely alter the planet's atmospheric chemistry. For an Earth-like planet, this process could wipe out a significant portion of ozone, which ultimately protects life from the dangerous ultraviolet radiation of its host star. It could also lead to the demise of a wide range of organisms, especially marine ones at the foundation of the food chain, leading to an extinction event.After years of lethal X-ray exposure from the supernova's interaction, and the impact of ultraviolet radiation from an Earth-like planet's host star, a large amount of nitrogen dioxide may be produced, causing a brown haze in the atmosphere, as shown in the illustration. A \"de-greening\" of land masses could also occur because of damage to plants.      A separate artist's impression (panel #1) depicts the same Earth-like planet as having been abundant with life at the time of the nearby supernova, years before most of the X-ray's impacts are felt (panel #2).                4 of the 31 supernovas in the study. Credit: NASA/CXC/Univ. of Illinois/I. Brunton et al             Among the four supernovae in the set of images, SN 2010jl has produced the most X-rays. The authors estimate it to have delivered a lethal dose of X-rays for Earth-like planets less than about 100 light-years away.There is strong evidence\u2014including the detection in different locations around the globe of a radioactive type of iron\u2014that supernovae occurred close to Earth between about 2 million and 8 million years ago. Researchers estimate these supernovae were between about 65 and 500 light-years away from Earth.Although the Earth and the solar system are currently in a safe space in terms of potential supernova explosions, many other planets in the Milky Way are not. These high-energy events would effectively shrink the areas within the Milky Way galaxy, known as the Galactic Habitable Zone, where conditions would be conducive for life as we know it.Because the X-ray observations of supernovae are sparse, particularly of the variety that strongly interact with their surroundings, the authors urge follow-up observations of interacting supernovae for months and years after the explosion.

  "text": "Astronomers have successfully launched a balloon-borne telescope which has begun capturing images of the universe on its first research flight.          The super pressure balloon-borne Imaging Telescope (SuperBIT) was flown to the edge of space by a helium-filled NASA scientific balloon the size of a football stadium where it will help researchers investigate the mystery of dark matter.SuperBIT has already taken its first images on this flight, showing the \"Tarantula Nebula\"\u2014a neighborhood of the Large Magellanic Cloud where new stars are being born, and the collision between the \"Antennae galaxies\" NGC 4038 and NGC 4039.SuperBIT is a collaboration between Durham University, UK, the University of Toronto, Canada, Princeton University, U.S., and NASA.It launched from W\u0101naka, New Zealand (Aotearoa) earlier this week, following a two-year delay due to the COVID pandemic.Carried by seasonally stable winds for about three months, it will circumnavigate the southern hemisphere several times\u2014imaging the sky all night, then using solar panels to recharge its batteries during the day.SuperBIT flies at 33.5km altitude, above 99.5 percent of the Earth's atmosphere. It takes high-resolution images like those of the Hubble Space Telescope, but with a wider field of view.                The SuperBIT telescope nestled among its solar panels and communications antennae. Picked up at dawn, ready to be carried to the launch pad beside the runway at W\u0101naka airport. Credit: Richard Massey.             The science goal for this first flight is to measure the properties of dark matter, a heavy but invisible type of material. Dark matter is all around us but poorly understood.SuperBIT will test whether dark matter particles can bounce off each other, by mapping the dark matter around clusters of galaxies that are colliding with neighboring galaxy clusters.Various theories about dark matter suggest that, during a collision, some dark matter might either slow down, spread out, or get chipped off.The researchers say that if they can map dark matter leaving the collision, they could finally start to learn what it is made of.Professor Richard Massey, of Durham University's Department of Physics, said, \"It takes the gravity from an entire galaxy to move dark matter and SuperBIT will look at clusters of galaxies that happen to be colliding with each other.                A false-color image taken by the SuperBIT telescope soon after launch in visible and ultra-violet light of a pair of galaxies smashing into each other. As they collide, the \u201cAntennae galaxies\u201d NGC 4038 and NGC 4039 are ripping strips off each other and opening themselves for inspection. Credit: SuperBIT             \"Essentially, we're using the largest particle accelerators in the universe, to smash lumps of dark matter and see where the bits fly.\"If dark matter goes 'crunch,' or if bits are chipped off, we could finally start to learn what it's made of.\"Although dark matter is invisible, SuperBIT will map where it is by the way it bends passing rays of light, a technique known as gravitational lensing.While telescopes on the ground have to squint through the Earth's atmosphere\u2014meaning their view can become blurred\u2014space-based telescopes get a clear view of the light that has traveled billions of years from the distant universe.SuperBIT is the first ever balloon-borne telescope capable of taking wide-field images with resolution limited only by the laws of optics.During its final test flight in 2019, SuperBIT demonstrated extraordinary pointing stability, with variation of less than one thirty-six thousandth of a degree for more than an hour.SuperBIT cost about $5 million, almost 1,000 times less than an equivalent satellite. Not only is helium cheaper than rocket fuel, but the ability of SuperBIT to return to Earth via parachute meant the team could tweak its design over several test flights.Reusable spacecraft can also be reconfigured and upgraded. For example, the development team buy a new camera shortly before each launch, because modern detectors are improving so rapidly. Using cutting-edge technology has kept SuperBIT young.

  "text": "Astronomers are celebrating NASA's Hubble Space Telescope's 33rd launch anniversary with an ethereal photo of a nearby star-forming region, NGC 1333. The nebula is in the Perseus molecular cloud, and located approximately 960 light-years away.          Hubble's colorful view, showcased through its unique capability to obtain images from ultraviolet to near-infrared light, unveils an effervescent cauldron of glowing gasses and pitch-black dust stirred up and blown around by several hundred newly forming stars embedded within the dark cloud. Hubble just scratches the surface because most of the star birthing firestorm is hidden behind clouds of fine dust\u2014essentially soot\u2014that are thicker toward the bottom of the image. The blackness in the image is not empty space, but filled with obscuring dust.To capture this image, Hubble peered through a veil of dust on the edge of a giant cloud of cold molecular hydrogen\u2014the raw material for fabricating new stars and planets under the relentless pull of gravity. The image underscores the fact that star formation is a messy process in our rambunctious universe.Ferocious stellar winds, likely from the bright blue star at the top of the image, are blowing through a curtain of dust. The fine dust scatters the starlight at blue wavelengths.Farther down, another bright, super-hot star shines through filaments of obscuring dust, looking like the sun shining through scattered clouds. A diagonal string of fainter accompanying stars looks reddish because dust is filtering starlight, allowing more of the red light to get through.Credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight CenterThe bottom of the picture presents a keyhole peek deep into the dark nebula. Hubble captures the reddish glow of ionized hydrogen. It looks like a fireworks finale, with several overlapping events. This is caused by pencil-thin jets shooting out from newly forming stars outside the frame of view. These stars are surrounded by circumstellar disks, which may eventually produce planetary systems, and powerful magnetic fields that direct two parallel beams of hot gas deep into space, like a double light saber from science fiction films. They sculpt patterns on the hydrogen cocoon, like laser-light-show tracings. The jets are a star's birth announcement.This view offers an example of the time when our sun and planets formed inside such a dusty molecular cloud, 4.6 billion years ago. Our sun didn't form in isolation but was instead embedded inside a mosh pit of frantic stellar birth, perhaps even more energetic and massive than NGC 1333.Hubble was deployed into orbit around Earth on April 25, 1990, by NASA astronauts aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery. To date, the legendary telescope has taken approximately 1.6 million observations of nearly 52,000 celestial targets. This treasure trove of knowledge about the universe is stored for public access in the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes, at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland.

  "text": "A study using data from telescopes on Earth and in the sky resolves a problem plaguing astronomers working in the infrared, and could help make better observations of the composition of the universe with the James Webb Space Telescope and other instruments. The work is published April 20 in Nature Astronomy.          \"We're trying to measure the composition of gases inside galaxies,\" said Yuguang Chen, a postdoctoral researcher working with Professor Tucker Jones in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of California, Davis.Most elements other than hydrogen, helium and lithium are produced inside stars, so the composition and distribution of heavier elements\u2014especially the ratio of oxygen to hydrogen\u2014can help astronomers understand how many and what kinds of stars are being formed in a distant object.Astronomers use two methods to measure oxygen in a galaxy, but unfortunately, they give different results. One common method, collisionally excited lines, gives a strong signal, but the results are thought to be sensitive to temperature changes, Chen said. A second method uses a different set of lines, called recombination lines, which are fainter but not thought to be affected by temperature.The recombination line method consistently produces measurements about double those from collisionally excited lines. Scientists attribute the discrepancy to temperature fluctuations in gas clouds, but this has not been directly proven, Chen said.Chen, Jones and colleagues used optical and infrared astronomy to measure oxygen abundance in dwarf galaxy Markarian 71, about 11 million light years from Earth. They used archived data from the recently retired SOFIA flying telescope and the retired Herschel Space Observatory, as well as making observations with telescopes at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Mauna Kea, Hawaii.SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy) was a telescope mounted in a Boeing 747 aircraft. By flying at 38,000 to 45,000 feet, the aircraft could get above 99% of the water vapor in Earth's atmosphere, which effectively blocks infrared light from deep space from reaching ground level. A joint project of NASA and the German space agency, SOFIA made its last operational flight in September 2022 and is now headed for a museum display in Tucson.The Herschel Space Observatory, named after astronomers William and Caroline Herschel, was an infrared space telescope operated by the European Space Agency. It was active from 2009 to 2013.A surprising resultWith data from these instruments, Chen and Jones examined oxygen abundance in Markarian 71 while correcting for temperature fluctuations. They found that the result from collisionally excited infrared lines was still 50% less than that from the recombination line method, even after eliminating the effect of temperature.\"This result is very surprising to us,\" Chen said. There is no consensus on an explanation for the discrepancy, he said. The team plans to look at additional objects to figure out what properties of galaxies correlate with this variation, Chen said.One of the goals of the James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2022, is to make infrared observations of the composition of distant galaxies in the first billion years of the universe. The new results provide a framework for making these measurements with the JWST and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array in Chile.Additional co-authors on the paper are: Ryan Sanders and Erin Huntzinger, UC Davis; Dario Fadder, Jessica Sutter and Robert Minchin, SOFIA Science Center, NASA Ames Research Center; Peter Senchyna, Observatories of the Carnegie Institute for Science, Pasadena; Daniel Stark and Benjamin Weiner, Steward Observatory, University of Arizona; Justin Spilker, Texas A&M University; and Guido Roberts-Borsani, UCLA.

  "text": "SpaceX's giant new rocket exploded minutes after blasting off on its first test flight Thursday and crashed into the Gulf of Mexico.          Elon Musk's company was aiming to send the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built on a round-the-world trip from the southern tip of Texas, near the Mexican border. The nearly 400-foot (120-meter) Starship carried no people or satellites.SpaceX later said multiple engines on the 33-engine booster were not firing as the rocket ascended, causing it to lose altitude and begin to tumble. The rocket was intentionally destroyed by its self-destruct system, exploding and plummeting into the water.Instead of a best-case-scenario 1 1/2-hour flight with the spacecraft on top peeling away and taking a lap around the world, the whole thing lasted four minutes. The rocket reached a maximum speed of about 1,300 mph (2,100 kph) and as high as 24 miles (39 kilometers), before going sideways and dropping.Throngs of spectators watched from South Padre Island, several miles away from the Boca Chica Beach launch site, which was off-limits. As Starship lifted off with a thunderous roar, the crowd screamed: \"Go, baby, go!\"                SpaceX's Starship launches from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, Thursday, April 20, 2023. Credit: AP Photo/Eric Gay             Musk, in a tweet, called it \"an exciting test launch of Starship! Learned a lot for next test launch in a few months.\" SpaceX termed it a \"rapid unscheduled disassembly.\"In the weeks leading up to the flight, Musk gave 50-50 odds that the spacecraft would reach orbit. He stressed that clearing the launch tower and not blowing up the pad would be a win.\"You never know exactly what's going to happen,\" said SpaceX livestream commentator and engineer John Insprucker. \"But as we promised, excitement is guaranteed and Starship gave us a rather spectacular end.\"At liftoff, the rocket kicked up huge plumes of sand and dust around the pad. In Port Isabel, about 10 miles (6 kilometers) away, particles covered cars and other surfaces. The only other report, said John Sandoval, assistant to the city manager, was a shattered window at a local business. \"Yes, it shook, rattled and rolled,\" he said of the rocket.                SpaceX's Starship launches from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, Thursday, April 20, 2023. Credit: AP Photo/Eric Gay             The Federal Aviation Administration said it would oversee the accident investigation, noting that no injuries or public property damage were reported. The agency also said that until it determines that there is no threat to public safety, Starships are grounded.      SpaceX intends to use Starship to send people and cargo to the moon and, eventually, Mars. NASA has reserved a Starship for its next moonwalking team, and rich tourists are already booking lunar flybys.Despite the abbreviated flight, congratulations poured in from NASA chief Bill Nelson and others in the space industry. Retired Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield tweeted, \"Huge accomplishment, huge lessons, onwards to the next attempt.\"\"It fell somewhere between a small step and their hoped-for giant leap, but it still represents significant progress toward a reusable super-heavy lift rocket,\" University of Chicago's Jordan Bimm, a space historian, said in an email.

Credit: AP Photo/Eric Gay             At 394 feet and nearly 17 million pounds of thrust, Starship easily surpasses NASA's moon rockets\u2014past, present and future. NASA successfully launched its new 322-foot (98-meter) moon rocket last November on a test flight, sending the empty Orion capsule around the moon.The stainless steel Starship rocket is designed to be fully reusable with fast turnaround, dramatically lowering costs, similar to what SpaceX's smaller Falcon rockets have done soaring from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Nothing was to be saved from this test flight, with the spacecraft\u2014if all had gone well\u2014aiming for a watery grave in the Pacific near Hawaii.The futuristic spacecraft flew several miles into the air during testing a few years ago, landing successfully only once. But this was the inaugural launch of the first-stage booster with 33 methane-fueled engines.

Monday's try was scrapped by a frozen booster valve.Jason and Lisa Flores drove down from Corpus Christi to watch the launch with their daughter, and noticed something was amiss.Lisa Flores cried seeing the liftoff and then realized, \"It's not working out the way it was supposed to.\"Elizabeth Trujillo, 13, wearing a \"Star Wars\" shirt and carrying toy binoculars, skipped school to see the launch from the beach with her mother and other relatives. The crowd cheered when Starship cleared the tower.Despite the failed attempt, \"it was worth it,\" said Jessica Trujillo, Elizabeth's mother. \"Just hearing and seeing the view, the excitement of the crowd, it was priceless.\"\"Practice makes perfect.

  "text": "Using the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO), astronomers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have investigated the atmosphere of MASCARA-4b\u2014a distant \"ultra-hot Jupiter\" exoplanet. The study, published April 11 on the arXiv pre-print server, resulted in the detection of rubidium and samarium in an exoplanet's atmosphere for the first time.          At a distance of some 556 light years away from the Earth, MASCARA-4b is a gas giant with an equilibrium temperature of 2,250 K orbiting a bright A-type star. Its size is about 1.51 Jupiter radii and its mass is 1.67 Jupiter masses, which gives a density at a level of 0.48 g/cm3. The planet orbits its host every 2.82 days, at a distance of 0.047 AU from it. Due to its large atmospheric scale heights and transmission spectroscopy metric (TSM), MASCARA-4b is an excellent target for atmospheric characterization.That is why a team of astronomers led by Zewen Jiang of the CAS Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy in Beijing, China, decided to observe MASCARA-4b with ESPRESSO\u2014a fiber-fed ultra-stable echelle high-resolution spectrograph, mounted on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) at European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Cerro Paranal, Chile.\"Two transits of MASCARA-4 b were observed on February 13, 2020 and March 1, 2020 with ESPRESSO under the ESO programs 0104.C-0605 (PI:WYTTENBACH).... In this letter, we present a survey of atoms/ions in the atmosphere of the MASCARA-4b, using the two VLT/ESPRESSO transits data,\" the researchers wrote.The observations detected several heavier species in the atmosphere of MASCARA-4 b, including rubidium (Rb), samarium (Sm), as well as ions of titanium (Ti+) and barium (Ba+). This is the first time when Rb and Sm are detected in the atmosphere of an exoplanet, while Ti+ and Ba+ were reported in several other extrasolar planets.Given that the new observations mark the third time when Ba+ is detected in the atmosphere of an ultra-hot Jupiter (UHJ) exoplanet, Jiang's team suspects that this element may be commonly present among the population of UHJs. The researchers added that the identification of Ba+ in high altitudes in UHJ's suggests that such planets may experience atmospheric dynamics that we currently do not expect.It was noted that Sm, with an atom number of 62, is so far the heaviest element found in the atmosphere of an alien world. It is also the first lanthanide series element that has been detected in exoplanets.Besides the new discoveries, the study also confirmed previous detections of magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), chromium (Cr) and iron (Fe) in the atmosphere of MASCARA-4b. The authors of the paper encourage further atmospheric studies of exoplanets in order to find other rare elements.\"Higher precision HRS [high-resolution spectroscopic] studies should be further conducted on UHJs to reveal the presence of additional species and even some relatively abundant minor isotopes,\" the researchers concluded.

  "text": "Under a cloudless sky, 20,000 eclipse chasers crowded a tiny outpost to watch a rare solar eclipse plunge part of Australia's northwest coast into brief midday darkness Thursday while temporarily cooling the tropical heat.          The remote tourist town of Exmouth, with fewer than 3,000 residents, was promoted as one of the best vantage points in Australia to see the eclipse that also crossed remote parts of Indonesia and East Timor.An international crowd had been gathering for days, camping in tents and trailers on a red, dusty plain on the edge of town with cameras and other viewing equipment pointed skyward.NASA astronomer Henry Throop was among those at Exmouth cheering loudly in the darkness.\"Isn't it incredible? This is so fantastic. It was mind-blowing. It was so sharp and it was so bright. You could see the corona around the sun there,\" the visibly excited Washington resident said.\"It's only a minute long, but it really felt like a long time. There's nothing else you can see which looks like that. It was just awesome. Spectacular. And then you could see Jupiter and Mercury and to be able to see those at the same time during the day\u2014even seeing Mercury at all is pretty rare. So that was just awesome,\" Throop added.First-time eclipse chaser Julie Copson, who traveled more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) north from the Australian west-coast port city of Fremantle to Exmouth, said the phenomenon left her skin tingling.

All this effort has come to fruition,\" Varrti said.In Indonesia's capital, hundreds came to the Jakarta Planetarium to see the partial eclipse that was obscured by clouds.Azka Azzahra, 21, came with her sister and friends to get a closer look by using the telescopes with hundreds of other visitors.\"I am still happy to come even though it is cloudy. It is happy to see how people with high enthusiasm come here to see the eclipse, because it is rare,\" Azzahra said.

Some of them came from other countries and gathered with locals to have a clear view of the eclipse.\"Timor Leste is one of the unique countries where the experience is less humid, less cloudy, so we are expecting a clear sky, that's why many international astronomers wish to converge here. We are hoping that there is going to be a clear sky,\" Zahri Bin Ahmad, astrophile from the South East Asia Astronomy Network of Brunei said as they waited Thursday.

They occur when Earth is in the \"sweet spot\" so the moon and the sun are almost the exact same size in the sky, said NASA solar expert Michael Kirk.At some points, the moon is a little closer and blocks out the sun in a total eclipse. But when the moon is a little farther away, it lets some of the sun's light peek out in an annular eclipse.

  "text": "European Space Agency director Josef Aschbacher promised a \"transformation\" of the continent's space sector in the coming years during an interview with AFP, including more collaboration between government and private industry.          Private firms will be \"encouraged to be a partner and not only a contractor,\" Aschbacher said, answering questions on the sidelines of an aerospace industry conference taking place this week in Colorado Springs, in the United States.US space agency NASA has long incorporated private firms into its space exploration, planning to send its astronauts to commercial orbiting outposts once the International Space Station is retired.But any major reorientation of the European space program will need to be discussed at the second European space summit, to be held in Seville, Spain, in November.Here are Aschbacher's answers to questions posed Tuesday by AFP.When will we know more about Europe's vision for space?Towards the space summit at the end of the year, I think we'll have a clearer picture of what is Europe's ambition in the next decade, which decisions we need to prepare today in order to get there. So there's a lot of work that's happening right now in Europe.I'm preparing the scenarios, and I'm preparing the facts, so that politicians can make a decision. It's up to them.                The European Space Agency's JUICE probe blasts into space on April 14, 2023 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket from Europe's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, on a mission to explore Jupiter's icy moons.             What are the different scenarios?It will be a phased approach. Certainly one step is cargo transport to low-Earth orbit (LEO), for commercial space stations\u2014because the space station by the end of the decade will be deorbited. We need a future LEO presence for Europe to continue our research.Second point is to get astronauts to LEO.Then the next block is to the Moon. That means first cargo not only to the Moon but also back from the Moon, and eventually astronauts to the Moon.And then of course there's a long-term perspective of going beyond the Moon towards Mars, but this is really further ahead.So for these various scenarios, we will develop architectures. What does it mean, what hardware, what are the cost estimates.... But it's also clear that this will be quite a different approach compared to how we procure today.So this will be a transformation of the space sector in Europe, which we also see here in the United States.How will the sector be transformed?Industry certainly will be not only invited, but encouraged to be a partner and not only a contractor. And we, ESA, we're not only a customer but a partner.That means we build up technology with them and for them. They have to engage, they have to commit. We provide the long-term framework and guarantee, we are a long-term anchor customer, but they need to provide the solution.We really would like to make them much more a driver in this new architectural buildup. Also them coming with money, which may be coming from their own sources. So that is really a new way of building up a space program.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:European Space Agency chief eyes tapping private industry partners (2023, April 19)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-european-space-agency-chief-eyes.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the astronomy mission that aims to return humans to the moon by the middle of the decade?",
  "answer_squad": " Artemis",
  "text": "Lunar exploration is undergoing a renaissance. Dozens of missions, organized by multiple space agencies\u2014and increasingly by commercial companies\u2014are set to visit the moon by the end of this decade. Most of these will involve small robotic spacecraft, but NASA's ambitious Artemis program, aims to return humans to the lunar surface by the middle of the decade.          There are various reasons for all this activity, including geopolitical posturing and the search for lunar resources, such as water-ice at the lunar poles, which can be extracted and turned into hydrogen and oxygen propellant for rockets. However, science is also sure to be a major beneficiary.The moon still has much to tell us about the origin and evolution of the solar system. It also has scientific value as a platform for observational astronomy.The potential role for astronomy of Earth's natural satellite was discussed at a Royal Society meeting earlier this year. The meeting itself had, in part, been sparked by the enhanced access to the lunar surface now in prospect.Far side benefitsSeveral types of astronomy would benefit. The most obvious is radio astronomy, which can be conducted from the side of the moon that always faces away from Earth\u2014the far side.The lunar far side is permanently shielded from the radio signals generated by humans on Earth. During the lunar night, it is also protected from the Sun. These characteristics make it probably the most \"radio-quiet\" location in the whole solar system as no other planet or moon has a side that permanently faces away from the Earth. It is therefore ideally suited for radio astronomy.Radio waves are a form of electromagnetic energy\u2014as are, for example, infrared, ultraviolet and visible-light waves. They are defined by having different wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum.Radio waves with wavelengths longer than about 15m are blocked by Earth's ionoshere. But radio waves at these wavelengths reach the moon's surface unimpeded. For astronomy, this is the last unexplored region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and it is best studied from the lunar far side.                Artist\u2019s conception of the LuSEE-Night radio astronomy experiment on the moon. Credit: Nasa/Tricia Talbert             Observations of the cosmos at these wavelengths come under the umbrella of \"low frequency radio astronomy.\" These wavelengths are uniquely able to probe the structure of the early universe, especially the cosmic \"dark ages\"\u2014an era before the first galaxies formed.At that time, most of the matter in the universe, excluding the mysterious dark matter, was in the form of neutral hydrogen atoms. These emit and absorb radiation with a characteristic wavelength of 21cm. Radio astronomers have been using this property to study hydrogen clouds in our own galaxy\u2014the Milky Way\u2014since the 1950s.Because the universe is constantly expanding, the 21cm signal generated by hydrogen in the early universe has been shifted to much longer wavelengths. As a result, hydrogen from the cosmic \"dark ages\" will appear to us with wavelengths greater than 10m. The lunar far side may be the only place where we can study this.The astronomer Jack Burns provided a good summary of the relevant science background at the recent Royal Society meeting, calling the far side of the moon a \"pristine, quiet platform to conduct low radio frequency observations of the early Universe's Dark Ages, as well as space weather and magnetospheres associated with habitable exoplanets.\"      Signals from other starsAs Burns says, another potential application of far side radio astronomy is trying to detect radio waves from charged particles trapped by magnetic fields\u2014magnetospheres\u2014of planets orbiting other stars.This would help to assess how capable these exoplanets are of hosting life. Radio waves from exoplanet magnetospheres would probably have wavelengths greater than 100m, so they would require a radio-quiet environment in space. Again, the far side of the moon will be the best location.A similar argument can be made for attempts to detect signals from intelligent aliens. And, by opening up an unexplored part of the radio spectrum, there is also the possibility of making serendipitous discoveries of new phenomena.We should get an indication of the potential of these observations when NASA's LuSEE-Night mission lands on the lunar far side in 2025 or 2026.                Permanently shadowed craters at the lunar poles could eventually host infrared telescopes. Credit: LROC / ASU / NASA             Crater depthsThe moon also offers opportunities for other types of astronomy as well. Astronomers have lots of experience with optical and infrared telescopes operating in free space, such as the Hubble telescope and JWST. However, the stability of the lunar surface may confer advantages for these types of instrument.Moreover, there are craters at the lunar poles that receive no sunlight. Telescopes that observe the universe at infrared wavelengths are very sensitive to heat and therefore have to operate at low temperatures. JWST, for example, needs a huge sunshield to protect it from the sun's rays. On the moon, a natural crater rim could provide this shielding for free.The moon's low gravity may also enable the construction of much larger telescopes than is feasible for free-flying satellites. These considerations have led the astronomer Jean-Pierre Maillard to suggest that the moon may be the future of infrared astronomy.The cold, stable environment of permanently shadowed craters may also have advantages for the next generation of instruments to detect gravitational waves\u2014\"ripples\" in space-time caused by processes such as exploding stars and colliding black holes.Moreover, for billions of years the moon has been bombarded by charged particles from the sun\u2014solar wind\u2014and galactic cosmic rays. The lunar surface may contain a rich record of these processes. Studying them could yield insights into the evolution of both the Sun and the Milky Way.For all these reasons, astronomy stands to benefit from the current renaissance in lunar exploration. In particular, astronomy is likely to benefit from the infrastructure built up on the moon as lunar exploration proceeds. This will include both transportation infrastructure\u2014rockets, landers and other vehicles\u2014to access the surface, as well as humans and robots on-site to construct and maintain astronomical instruments.But there is also a tension here: human activities on the lunar far side may create unwanted radio interference, and plans to extract water-ice from shadowed craters might make it difficult for those same craters to be used for astronomy. As my colleagues and I recently argued, we will need to ensure that lunar locations that are uniquely valuable for astronomy are protected in this new age of lunar exploration.

  "text": "Scientists from research institutions including Kyoto University have confirmed that the intrinsic alignments of galaxies have characteristics that allow it to be a powerful probe of dark matter and dark energy on a cosmological scale.          By gathering evidence that the distribution of galaxies more than tens of millions of light years away is subject to the gravitational effects of dark matter, the team succeeded in testing general theory of gravity at vast spatial scales. The international team analyzed the positions and orientations of galaxies, acquired from archived data of 1.2 million galaxy observations.With the help of available 3D positional information of each galaxy, the resulting statistical analysis quantitatively characterized the extent to which the orientation of distant galaxies is aligned. The work is published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\"These alignments, which are primarily produced by interactions with nearby objects, have been regarded as systematic noise in measuring weak lensing effect,\" states lead author Atsushi Taruya of KyotoU's Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics.\"We have also successfully measured the rate at which the galaxy distribution gradually becomes denser due to gravity, which is consistent with the general theory of relativity,\" says Teppei Okumura of the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics.\"Our research verified general relativity at the distant universe, but the nature of dark energy or the origin of cosmic acceleration still remains unresolved,\" adds Okumura.The archived data\u2014obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey\u2014consists of three galaxy samples selected for their brightness and distance. In addition, 3D positions and shape information for each galaxy helped to measure the magnitude of alignment relative to distant galaxies.The results of the team's model corroborated with theoretical calculations and gave Taruya and Okumura strong evidence that the orientations of these galaxies are related to each other, demonstrating a stronger case for general relativity on a cosmological scale.\"Current endeavors, such as the Subaru Telescope project, will provide extremely high-quality, high-precision observational data. These will spearhead innovative cosmological research using the intrinsic alignments to shed light on the nature of dark energy,\" notes Taruya.

  "answer_squad": " 2.04 mas/year",
  "text": "By analyzing the data from the 104-cm Sampurnanand Telescope (ST) and ESA's Gaia satellite, astronomers from India have inspected a Galactic open cluster known as NGC 1027. Results of the study, published April 12 on the arXiv pre-print server, shed more light on the properties of this cluster.          Open clusters (OCs), formed from the same giant molecular cloud, are groups of stars loosely gravitationally bound to each other. So far, more than 1,000 of them have been discovered in the Milky Way, and scientists are still looking for more, hoping to find a variety of these stellar groupings. Expanding the list of known galactic open clusters and studying them in detail could be crucial for improving our understanding of the formation and evolution of our galaxy.Located some 3,300 light years away in the eastern part of the Cassiopeia constellation, NGC 1027 (also known as Melotte 16 or Collinder 30) is an intermediate-age OC discovered by William Herschel in 1787. The cluster is estimated to be 355 million years old and its reddening was found to be at a level of 0.36 mag.A team of astronomers led by Apara Tripathi of the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gorakhpur University in Gorakhpur, India, decided to perform a photometric and kinematic study of NGC 1027 in order to get more insights into its structural and fundamental parameters. For this purpose they analyzed the available data collected by ST and Gaia.\"We present the photometric and kinematic study of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 1027 using UBV RIc data taken with the 1.04m Sampunanand telescope and Gaia EDR3 [Early Data Release 3] data,\" the researchers wrote in the paper.The study found that NGC 1027 has a radius of about 8.64 light years and that its center is approximately 2 arcminutes away from the center reported by previous observations. The mean proper motion for the cluster was measured to be -0.84 and 2.04 mas/year, in right ascension and declination, respectively.The astronomers conducted a membership analysis of NGC 1027 and identified 217 member stars (with membership probability higher than 70%) in the cluster region. They noted that the distribution of proper motion of the stars in the cluster region shows a clear separation between the cluster members and field stars.The researchers found that NGC 1027 has an age of some 130 million years, therefore, the cluster is younger than previously thought. The distance to NGC 1027 was measured to be about 3,700 light years and the cluster's reddening was found to be 0.36\u2014in good agreement with previous estimates.The study conducted by Tripathi's team also found that relatively massive stars are dominantly distributed in the inner regions of NGC 1027. The authors of the paper concluded that this suggests mass segregation, and they assume that the cluster is under the influence of external tidal interactions.

All around our planet, ultralow-frequency waves compose a cacophonous operetta portraying the dramatic relationship between Earth and the sun.          Now, a new citizen science project called HARP\u2014or Heliophysics Audified: Resonances in Plasmas\u2014has turned those once-unheard waves into audible whistles, crunches, and whooshes. Early tests have already made surprising finds, and citizen scientists can join the journey of sonic space exploration to decipher the cosmic vibrations that help sing the song of the sun and Earth.\"What excites me most about the HARP project is the ability for citizen scientists to make new discoveries in heliophysics research through audio analysis,\" said the project's principal investigator, Michael Hartinger, a heliophysicist at the Space Science Institute in Colorado. \"We need their help to understand complex patterns in the near-Earth space environment.\"Between Earth and the sun, space is not truly empty but is filled with a soup of charged particles called plasma. This plasma comes from the sun, pumped out in a steady stream called the solar wind and sporadically blasted away in explosive solar eruptions. When this solar plasma strikes Earth, it causes the magnetic field lines and plasma around Earth to vibrate like the plucked strings of a harp, producing ultralow-frequency waves.Listen to the sounds of space and help learn more about the Sun-Earth relationship with NASA\u2019s new HARP citizen science project. Credit: NASA/Beth AnthonyIn 2007, NASA launched five satellites to fly through Earth's magnetic \"harp\"\u2014its magnetosphere\u2014as part of the THEMIS mission (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms). Since then, THEMIS has been gathering a bounty of information about plasma waves across Earth's magnetosphere.\"THEMIS can sample the whole harp,\" Hartinger said, \"and it's been out there a long time, so it has collected a lot of data.\"The frequencies of the waves THEMIS measures are too low for our ears to hear, however. So the HARP team sped them up to convert them to sound waves. By using an interactive tool developed by the team, you can listen to these waves and pick out interesting features you hear in the sounds.Earth's magnetosphere is a magnetic bubble that envelops and protects our planet from most of the charged particles that flow from our Sun. However, when solar particles strike the magnetosphere, they can cause magnetic field lines and plasma around Earth to vibrate like the plucked strings of a harp, producing ultralow-frequency waves. Credit: Martin Archer (Imperial College London)/Emmanuel Masongsong (UCLA)/NASA\"The process of identifying new features through deep listening feels a bit like treasure hunting,\" said Robert Alexander, a HARP team member from Auralab Technologies in Michigan. \"I'm excited for individuals around the world to get a taste of this experience through the HARP project.\"      According to the team, humans are often better at picking out interesting wave patterns by ear than by eye\u2014and can even do better than computers at identifying complex patterns that emerge during extreme solar events.\"The human sense of hearing is an amazing tool,\" said HARP team member Martin Archer of Imperial College London. \"We're essentially trained from birth to recognize patterns and pick out different sound sources. We can innately do some pretty crazy analysis that outperforms even some of our most advanced computer algorithms.\"HARP was inspired by an earlier sonification project led by Archer called MUSICS (Magnetospheric Undulations Sonified Incorporating Citizen Scientists). When Archer asked high school students in London to listen to sonified data (measurements converted into sound) from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) satellites, they identified a new plasma wave pattern related to solar storms.\"London high school students were able to pick out a complex but repeatable pattern in the sound that the automated methods missed,\" Hartinger said. \"HARP is going to take this to a new level working with a much larger dataset from NASA's THEMIS mission and with a much larger online audience.\"There's an advantage to having a wide and diverse group of people listen to the sounds, the team says.\"Everyone hears the world differently,\" explained Emmanuel Masongsong of the University of California, Los Angeles, who is a HARP team member and a member of NASA's THEMIS mission. \"Every participant will react uniquely to the vibrations in space. What one person ignores, another may be drawn to immediately. We want people to discover things that we never considered, or that computer algorithms would not be able to detect. That's how discoveries are made!\"Preliminary investigations with HARP have already started revealing unexpected features, such as what the team calls a \"reverse harp\"\u2014frequencies changing in the opposite way than what scientists anticipated.\"HARP has the potential to find things that we weren't expecting, which is really exciting,\" Archer stated.HARP could also provide insights about phenomena that other NASA citizen scientists have encountered, such as sounds heard by amateur radio operators participating in the HamSCI project, or wave-like auroras examined through the Aurorasaurus project.\"Data sonification provides human beings with an opportunity to appreciate the naturally occurring music of the cosmos,\" said Alexander. \"We're hearing sounds that are literally out of this world, and for me that's the next best thing to floating in a spacesuit.\"To start exploring these sounds, visit the HARP website.

That's what happened to University of Hawaii astronomer Shadia Habbal\u2014several times.After traveling all the way to Antarctica on her latest expedition to study the inner part of the Sun's outer atmosphere\u2014the corona\u2014Habbal was met with clouds once again. \"It was a completely grayed-out sky,\" Habbal recalled.Now, as Habbal prepares to observe a total solar eclipse from the western tip of Australia this week, she has a plan to try to combat any clouds that might interfere with her next chance to conduct her investigation.\"Why don't we fly a kite?\" one of Habbal's collaborators proposed after the thwarted eclipse observation in Antarctica.So on April 20, a team led by Habbal will use a large kite to loft her scientific instrument about 3,500 feet (or a kilometer) above the Australian landscape.Funded by NASA, the experiment will fly a spectrometer called ALIMAS (for Advanced Low Intensity Multiplexed Astronomical Spectrometer). Spectrometers can separate light into its component wavelengths, revealing details such as elemental composition, temperature, and motion.With this information, Habbal hopes to better understand how charged particles\u2014namely, electrons, protons, and other heavier elements\u2014escape the Sun through the corona to form the solar wind, an ever-flowing stream that fills the solar system. Most of the action happens close to the Sun, in the inner part of the corona, which we can view briefly only during total solar eclipses. (Coronagraphs\u2014often used on solar observatories to mimic total eclipses by blocking the Sun with an artificial disk\u2014cover up the innermost part of the corona.)                This Cody box-shaped kite will fly a NASA-funded scientific instrument to study the total solar eclipse in Australia on April 20, 2023. Standing next to the kite is team member Benedict Justen, who proposed flying the instrument on a kite and designed a device that will allow the airborne instrument to track the eclipsed Sun during totality. Credit: Klemens Brumann and Benedict Justen             Habbal is also trying to learn more about the origins of features that emerge in the inner corona, such as towers of plasma called prominences and explosive eruptions called coronal mass ejections, which blast solar material into the solar system.      The kite that will carry the spectrometer is known as a box-type Cody kite, which means it is box-shaped and has wings. The kite's wingspan is about 21 feet (6.5 meters) across. When it reaches its peak height in the sky, it will appear roughly the same size as a large passenger plane cruising overhead and will not block the view of the eclipse for anyone on the ground. The kite and spectrometer will be launched on a kilometer-long tether attached to a tow bar on a vehicle. In the case that the tether breaks, a parachute attached to the spectrometer will safely deliver the instrument back to the ground.Even if there are no clouds in the sky during the eclipse, Habbal's team plans to fly the experiment on the kite as a technology demonstration to find out whether kite-based observations could work for future eclipses. If the experiment is successful, Habbal hopes to fly it again in the United States during the total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024, but even higher (up to 4 kilometers) and for a longer period of time.\"The Australia eclipse is only about one minute, whereas the U.S. eclipse will be longer\u2014over four minutes in many places,\" Habbal said.If successful, it will also be the first time a NASA heliophysics experiment has been flown on a kite.\"We haven't done that yet\u2014used a kite for heliophysics,\" said NASA scientist Madhulika Guhathakurta, who leads the agency's Heliophysics Innovation in Technology and Science (HITS) program, which provided funding for Habbal's experiment. \"In the future we could be using this platform for many different types of novel investigations.\"\"I think this is the beginning of an incredible opportunity,\" Habbal added.To watch this solar eclipse and learn more about the kite experiment, tune in to NASA Science Live at 10:30 p.m. EDT on April 19, which will be livestreaming the eclipse and discussing the kite experiment in Australia.

  "text": "Now in its fifth year in space, NASA's TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) remains a rousing success. TESS's cameras have mapped more than 93% of the entire sky, discovered 329 new worlds and thousands more candidates, and provided new insights into a wide array of cosmic phenomena, from stellar pulsations and exploding stars to supermassive black holes.          Using its four cameras, TESS monitors large swaths of the sky called sectors for about a month at a time. Each sector measures 24 by 96 degrees, about as wide as a person's hand at arm's length and stretching from the horizon to the zenith. The cameras capture a total of 192 million pixels in each full-frame image. During its primary mission, TESS captured one of these images every 30 minutes, but this torrent of data has increased with time. The cameras now record each sector every 200 seconds.\"The volume of high-quality TESS data now available is quite impressive,\" said Knicole Col\u00f3n, the mission's project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"We have more than 251 terabytes just for one of the main data products, called full-frame images. That's the equivalent of streaming 167,000 movies in full HD.\"\"TESS extracts parts of each full-frame image to make cutouts around specific cosmic objects\u2014more than 467,000 of them at the moment\u2014and together they create a detailed record of changing brightness for each one,\" said Christina Hedges, lead for the TESS General Investigator Office and a research scientist at both the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Goddard. \"We use these files to produce light curves, a product that graphically shows how a source's brightness alters over time.\"To find exoplanets, or worlds beyond our solar system, TESS looks for the telltale dimming of a star caused when an orbiting planet passes in front of it. But stars also change brightness for other reasons: exploding as supernovae, erupting in sudden flares, dark star spots on their rotating surfaces, and even slight changes due to oscillations driven by internal sound waves. The rapid, regular observations from TESS enable more detailed study of these phenomena.This mosaic combines more than 900 images from all 24-by-90-degree sectors surveyed by NASA's TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) through October 2022. The mosaic covers 93% of the sky and builds up in chronological order, illustrating the mission's progress over the past five years. A prominent feature in the mosaic is the Milky Way, a glowing U-shaped band that represents the bright central plane of our galaxy. Credit: NASA/MIT/TESS and Ethan Kruse (University of Maryland College Park)Some stars give TESS a trifecta of brightness-changing behavior. One example is AU Microscopii, thought to be about 25 million years old\u2014a rowdy youngster less than 1% the age of our Sun. Spotted regions on AU Mic's surface grow and shrink, and the star's rotation carries them into and out of sight. The stormy star also erupts with frequent flares. With all this going on, TESS, with the help of NASA's now-retired Spitzer Space Telescope, discovered a planet about four times Earth's size orbiting the star every 8.5 days. Then, in 2022, scientists announced that TESS data revealed the presence of another, smaller world, one almost three times Earth's size and orbiting every 18.9 days. These discoveries have made the system a touchstone for understanding how stars and planets form and evolve.      Here are a few more of the mission's greatest hits:TESS has observed hundreds of supernovae and thousands of other candidate transient, or short-lived, events so far.TOI 700 d was the first planet TESS found that orbits within its star's habitable zone. That's the range of orbital distances where liquid water potentially could exist on the planet's surface. In January, astronomers announced this Earth-sized world was joined by another, TOI 700 e, that also orbits in the star's habitable or \"Goldilocks\" zone.The active galaxy ESO 253-3 hosts a 78-million-solar-mass black hole that flares up every 114 days, the first supermassive black hole shown to flare regularly. To understand why, astronomers combined ground-based observations of the flares with data from TESS, NASA's Swift and NuSTAR telescopes, and the XMM-Newton satellite operated by ESA (the European Space Agency). The most likely answer, they say, is that a giant star skims close enough to the monster black hole once each orbit that the black hole's gravity strips away some stellar gas. This material falls inward, creating a flare when it strikes the vast disk of gas surrounding the black hole.TESS discovered a trio of hot worlds larger than Earth orbiting a much younger version of our Sun called TOI 451, located about 400 light-years away. The system was found in a newly discovered \"river\" of stars called the Pisces-Eridanus stream, which stretches across one-third of the sky. TESS showed that many of the stars revealed had star spots and rotated rapidly\u2014clear evidence the stream was only 120 million years old, or one-eighth the age of previous estimates.New discoveries are waiting to be made within the huge volume of data TESS has already captured. This is a library of observations astronomers will explore for years, but there's much more to come.\"We're celebrating TESS's fifth anniversary at work\u2014and wishing it many happy returns,\" Col\u00f3n said.

  "text": "Northern lights enthusiasts got a surprise mixed in with the green bands of light dancing in the Alaska skies: A light baby blue spiral resembling a galaxy appeared amid the aurora for a few minutes.          The cause early Saturday morning was a little more mundane than an alien invasion or the appearance of a portal to the far reaches of the universe. It was simply excess fuel released from a SpaceX rocket that launched from California about three hours earlier.Sometimes rockets have fuel that needs to be jettisoned, said space physicist Don Hampton, a research associate professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute.\"When they do that at high altitudes, that fuel turns into ice,\" he said. \"And if it happens to be in the sunlight, when you're in the darkness on the ground, you can see it as a sort of big cloud, and sometimes it's swirly.\"While not a common sight, Hampton said he's seen such occurrences about three times.The appearance of the swirl was caught in time-lapse on the Geophysical Institute's all-sky camera and shared widely. \"It created a bit of an internet storm with that spiral,\" Hampton said.Photographers out for the northern lights show also posted their photos on social media.                In this photo provided by Christopher Hayden, a light baby blue spiral resembling a galaxy appears amid the aurora for a few minutes in the Alaska skies near Fairbanks, Saturday, April 15, 2023. The spiral was formed when excess fuel that had been released from a SpaceX rocket that launched from California about three hours earlier turned to ice, and then the water vapor reflected the sunlight in the upper atmosphere. Credit: Christopher Hayden via AP             \"This all happened as it passed over Alaska during a beautiful aurora display, stunning many night-watchers including myself,\" professional photographer Todd Salat, known for stunning aurora images, told The Associated Press in an email.\"Trust me, at first, I was totally bewildered,\" he said. \"I now know it can be explained with rocket science, but during and immediately after the experience, I thoroughly enjoyed the mysterious feeling of the unknown.\"The rocket took off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on Friday night with about 25 satellites as its payload.The timing of the fuel dump and the fact that it was a polar launch made the blue spiral visible over a large swath of Alaska. \"And we got that really cool looking spiral thing,\" Salat noted.In January, another spiral was seen, this time over Hawaii's Big Island. A camera at the summit of Mauna Kea, outside the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan's Subaru telescope, captured a spiral swirling through the night sky.Researchers have said it was from the launch of a military GPS satellite that lifted off earlier on a SpaceX rocket in Florida.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

  "answer_race": " To introduce a new subsystem for NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the subsystem that was delivered to Ball Aerospace?",
  "answer_squad": " the Simplified Relative Calibration System",
  "text": "A vital subsystem for NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope was recently delivered to Ball Aerospace in Boulder, Colorado, and installed in the spacecraft's Wide Field Instrument (WFI). Called the Simplified Relative Calibration System (sRCS), this component will allow astronomers to measure the total light output of cosmic objects like galaxies and supernovae with extreme accuracy. When Roman launches by May 2027, scientists will use this data to unravel the secrets of dark energy and dark matter, discover exoplanets, and explore many topics in infrared astrophysics.          \"Without this calibration tool, we wouldn't be able to gather accurate enough measurements to achieve the next-level science Roman is designed to do,\" said Joshua Schlieder, a research astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.The Roman team originally planned to use a different version of the sRCS. But to ensure the sRCS would be ready on time and of the caliber needed for the mission, a team of engineers at Goddard jumped in with a new approach. Using some components from the original version, the team redesigned, built, and tested the sRCS\u2014a process that usually takes several years\u2014in about a year and a half, while ensuring it will meet all of the mission's requirements.\"This incredible feat was only made possible by pulling in extraordinary engineers and scientists from various disciplines who exemplify the teamwork and dedication that NASA prides itself in,\" said Hali Flores, the sRCS product development lead at Goddard.The subsystem was delivered to Ball Aerospace, where it was integrated into the WFI's Cold Sensing Module, pictured above. The gold and silver component at the center of the photo near the bottom is the electronics box that controls the sRCS, and we can see its output light as a red glow near the center of the image.The heart of the system is a softball-sized hollow sphere built by Hawaii Aerospace Corporation in Honolulu. Its interior is made of a diffusely reflective material called Spectralon that interacts with light from 24 light-emitting diodes (LEDs), in six different wavelength bands corresponding to the visible and infrared filters of the WFI. It will illuminate the detector array (which will fit in the smile-shaped hole in front of the red light like a puzzle piece) with precisely controlled light at different intensities.Scientists will periodically compare how the detectors respond to that light with their response to light from cosmic objects, which will reduce uncertainty in Roman's measurements. The sRCS is designed to enable the detectors to measure the relative brightness of celestial objects to roughly 0.1 percent accuracy even when the objects differ in brightness by a factor of 100,000.                This photo shows the engineering test unit of Roman's Simplified Relative Calibration System's light source \u201csphere.\u201d Light exits the sRCS through the gold cylinder on top. It can be seen as the red glow in the first image on this page. This subsystem will enable astronomers to measure the brightness of stars, galaxies, supernovae, and more with extreme accuracy. Credit: Hawaii Aerospace             \"The sRCS helps scientists understand exactly how our detectors respond to the light from the objects we observe\u2014particularly how that response varies with the color or brightness of the light,\" said Jackie Townsend, Roman's deputy project manager at Goddard. \"The ability to do this on-orbit with this accuracy is unique to Roman, and is core to achieving our science objectives.\"Next, additional components will be integrated into the WFI, including the detectors in May. Then, the sRCS and detectors will be tested together. As part of a thermal test this fall, the sRCS will perform its first calibration sequence on the detectors that will fly aboard the spacecraft.

  "answer_squad": " topological soliton",
  "text": "It looks like a black hole and bends light like a black hole, but it could actually be a new type of star.          Though the mysterious object is a hypothetical mathematical construction, new simulations by Johns Hopkins researchers suggest there could be other celestial bodies in space hiding from even the best telescopes on Earth. The findings are set to publish in Physical Review D.\"We were very surprised,\" said Pierre Heidmann, a Johns Hopkins University physicist who led the study. \"The object looks identical to a black hole, but there's light coming out from its dark spot.\"The detection of gravitational waves in 2015 rocked the world of astrophysics because it confirmed the existence of black holes. Inspired by those findings, the Johns Hopkins team set out to explore the possibility of other objects that could produce similar gravitational effects but that could be passing as black holes when observed with ultraprecise sensors on Earth, said co-author and Johns Hopkins physicist Ibrahima Bah.\"How would you tell when you don't have a black hole? We don't have a good way to test that,\" Bah said. \"Studying hypothetical objects like topological solitons will help us figure that out as well.\"The new simulations realistically depict an object the Johns Hopkins team calls a topological soliton. The simulations show an object looking like a blurry photo of a black hole from afar but like something else entirely up close.The object is hypothetical at this stage. But the fact that the team could construct it using mathematical equations and show what it looks like with simulations suggests there could be other types of celestial bodies in space hiding from even the best telescopes on Earth.The findings show how the topological soliton distorts space exactly as a black hole does\u2014but behaves unlike a black hole as it scrambles and releases weak light rays that would not escape the strong gravitational force of a true hole.Movie clip showing the gravitational lensing effects caused by no object in an observer's line of sight, a black hole, and the topological soliton. Credit: Pierre Heidmann / Johns Hopkins University.\"Light is strongly bent, but instead of being absorbed like it would in a black hole, it scatters in funky motions until at one point it comes back to you in a chaotic manner,\" Heidmann said. \"You don't see a dark spot. You see a lot of blur, which means light is orbiting like crazy around this weird object.\"      A black hole's gravitational field is so intense that light can orbit around it at a certain distance from its center, in the same way that Earth orbits the sun. This distance determines the edge of the hole's \"shadow,\" so that any incoming light will fatally hit the region that scientists call the \"event horizon.\" There, nothing can escape\u2014not even light.The Hopkins team simulated several scenarios using pictures of outer space as if they had been captured with a camera, placing a black hole and the topological soliton in front of the lens. The results produced distorted pictures because of the gravitational effects of the massive bodies.\"These are the first simulations of astrophysically relevant string theory objects, since we can actually characterize the differences between a topological soliton and a black hole as if an observer was seeing them in the sky,\" Heidmann said.Motivated by various results from string theory, Bah and Heidmann discovered ways to construct topological solitons using Einstein's theory of general relativity in 2021. While the solitons are not predictions of new objects, they serve as the best models of what new quantum gravity objects could look like compared to black holes.Scientists have previously created models of boson stars, gravastars, and other hypothetical objects that could exert similar gravitational effects with exotic forms of matter. But the new research accounts for pillar theories of the inner workings of the universe that other models don't. It uses string theory that reconciles quantum mechanics and Einstein's theory of gravity, the researchers said.\"It's the start of a wonderful research program,\" Bah said. \"We hope in the future to be able to genuinely propose new types of ultracompact stars consisting of new kinds of matter from quantum gravity.\"The team includes Johns Hopkins physicist Emanuele Berti. The topological soliton in the simulations was first constructed in research published in 2022 by Bah's group.

  "text": "As NASA builds a blueprint for human exploration throughout the solar system for the benefit of humanity, the agency released Tuesday the outcomes from its first Architecture Concept Review, a robust analysis process designed to align NASA's moon to Mars exploration strategy and codify the supporting architecture.          \"Our first Architecture Concept Review is a milestone that will help our moon to Mars strategy unfold through the objectives in missions both near and long term,\" said NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy. \"We're aligned with partners toward a future of expanded economic opportunity, scientific discovery, and greater activity on and around the moon, and with limitless possibilities deeper in the solar system.\"NASA's Architecture Definition Document written for highly technical audiences, and an associated executive summary, provide a deep dive into NASA's moon to Mars architecture approach and development process. Six supporting white papers also released address frequently discussed exploration architecture topics.\"NASA now has a goal-based foundation upon which to build our current and future exploration plans,\" said Cathy Koerner, deputy associate administrator for the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"Our approach is designed to ensure exploration of the moon and Mars has staying power.\"NASA's process answers a call from Vice President Harris, as Chair of the National Space Council, to develop a plan for an initial lunar surface architecture which includes commercial and international partnerships. The agency's moon to Mars architecture represents the hardware and operations needed for human missions to the moon and Mars, and how they function together as system.The architecture is not a mission, a manifest, or a set of requirements, but defines the elements\u2014rockets, spacecraft, rovers, spacesuits, communications relays, and more\u2014that will be incrementally developed and delivered to the moon and Mars for long-term, human-led scientific discovery in deep space.NASA released its revised moon to Mars Objectives in 2022 as guideposts in the agency's moon to Mars exploration approach to help space NASA investments, as well as those of the agency's industry and international space agency partners, toward the moon and beyond. They cover four broad areas: science; transportation and habitation; lunar and Martian infrastructure; and operations. The objectives were informed by input from U.S. industry, international space agencies, NASA's workforce, and others.The agency began developing its Architecture Definition Document in late 2022 as a detailed look at how current objectives are distilled into specific architecture elements. The agency plans yearly Architecture Concept Reviews to incorporate new technological capabilities and evolving objectives.Under Artemis, NASA has set a vision to explore more of the moon than ever before. With the crew for Artemis II recently named, the agency plans to return humans to the moon and establish a cadence of missions starting at the lunar South Pole region. These missions set up a long-term presence to inform future exploration of Mars and other potential destinations in the solar system.

  "answer_race": " A successful wind mission.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the instrument that Aeolus carries?",
  "answer_squad": " ALADIN",
  "text": "On 30 April 2023, all nominal operations of Aeolus, the first mission to observe Earth's wind profiles on a global scale, will conclude in preparation for a series of end of life activities.          Although a recent upgrade to Aeolus' original laser meant that in its last months it has been performing as well as ever, diminishing fuel combined with increasing solar activity means the mission must come to an end.That ESA's wind mission has made it this far is a great achievement, having outlived its predicted lifetime of three years by over 18 months.But it's not over just yet.Over the past year, scientists and industry specialists have been designing a thorough roadmap to bring the Aeolus mission to a close. After much consideration and careful planning it was decided that the best course of action is to carefully re-enter the satellite back to Earth.The finishing touches to the end-of-life schedule will be made over the coming weeks and a timeline will be announced in due course.In the meantime, Aeolus will provide data as usual up to the end of operations on 30 April 2023. While no new operational data will be gathered after 30 April, the mission's existing data will still be available to users.\"My gratitude goes to all our ESA and industry colleagues who have developed and operated this unique mission,\" said Aeolus Mission Manager, Tommaso Parrinello.\"A special thanks goes to the scientific community, whose support has been outstanding and has contributed to one of the most successful missions ever flown by ESA.\"A trailblazing wind missionAeolus, ESA's fifth Earth Explorer, was tasked with an extraordinarily challenging and pioneering feat: to measure global winds from space using a laser.Its launch in 2018 was an achievement some thought might not be possible, especially after many years of grit and determination to make its experimental technology work. Plenty of headscratchers and setbacks were encountered along the way.Once in orbit Aeolus met further trials, being forced into switching to its back up laser less than a year after launch.The struggles were worth it, as Europe's wind mission triumphed.Aeolus data are now used by major weather forecasting services worldwide, including the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, the UK Met Office, Germany's Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD), and India's National Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF).Its many successes, including economic benefits valued at over \u20ac3.5 billion, mean that an operational follow-on mission called Aeolus-2 will be launched within a decade.                Despite exceeding its design life in orbit, ESA\u2019s Aeolus mission continues to deliver excellent data. The uses for Aeolus wind data are many, from predicting the weather and improving climate models, to tracking events in near-realtime, such as the recent Hunga Tonga volcanic eruption. The image shows how the ash from the eruption left its mark in Aeolus\u2019 measurements on 15 January 2022. A huge blip, or drop, can be seen in the Aeolus signal over the Tonga region, suggesting the plume of volcanic ash must have reached an altitude above the range that can be detected by Aeolus. Credit: ESA             Remarkable improvements in weather forecastsAeolus carries an instrument known as ALADIN, which is Europe's most sophisticated Doppler wind lidar flown in space. A laser fires pulses of ultraviolet light towards Earth's atmosphere, and a receiver detects the light that is scattered back from air molecules, water molecules, and aerosols such as dust.Thanks to subtle changes in the properties of the light that is received, we can measure how quickly these particles travel away from Aeolus\u2014the speed of the wind.Over its four and a half year lifetime, orbiting Earth 16 times a day and covering the entire globe once a week, ALADIN has beamed down over seven billion laser pulses.Supported by the ground segment team, well over 99.5% of the data collected reach users such as weather forecasters within three hours.The impacts have been remarkable.Since ECMWF started assimilating Aeolus data in 2020 the satellite has become one of the highest impact-per-observation instruments in existence.A lot is down to Aeolus' capacity to measure winds where data are scarce. When planes were grounded during the lockdowns imposed due to the COVID pandemic, Aeolus was able to contribute missing data to plug the gap in weather forecasts.Researchers recently concluded that Aeolus data could also help to improve forecasting of hurricanes in regions of the planet where reconnaissance flights are sparse, particularly over the tropics.A universal collaborationThe Aeolus mission has been underpinned by a tightly-knit, Europe-wide collaboration of over forty experts that make up the Aeolus Data, Innovation, and Science Cluster (DISC).Years of calibration and validation activities by the DISC, including tens of thousands of kilometers flown in field campaigns from Greenland to Cape Verde, have honed and improved the instrument and the quality of its data.In recent years, an international collaboration known as the Joint Aeolus Tropical Airborne Campaign (JATAC) has expanded the remit of Aeolus, honing in on the use of Aeolus data to measure the role of aerosols in tropical weather systems.Where aerosols are concerned, Aeolus has managed to provide unique insight into volcanic plumes. The satellite was able to track the huge Hunga Tonga eruption of January 2022, and observed a completely new atmospheric phenomenon following the eruption of Raikoke in 2019.Aeolus wind data also improve modeling of plumes as they spread through Earth's atmosphere, which benefits air traffic safety.Other innovative projects have used Aeolus data to understand a range of phenomena from Saharan dust to ocean biochemistry and sea surface winds.The results will inform future Earth Explorer missions such as EarthCARE, a collaborative mission between ESA and JAXA that will carry a similar lidar instrument to measure atmospheric aerosols and clouds.\"The Aeolus mission has been a triumph of European innovation, collaboration and technical excellence,\" says ESA's Director of Earth Observation Programs, Simonetta Cheli.\"Aeolus is another example of how ESA's Earth Explorers perform beyond expectations, and a shining light for our Future EO program. Its impacts will live long beyond its lifetime in space, paving the way for future operational missions such as Aeolus-2.\" Provided byEuropean Space AgencyCitation:Trailblazing Aeolus mission winding down (2023, April 18)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-trailblazing-aeolus-mission.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the town that eclipse chasers will be visiting this week?",
  "answer_squad": " Exmouth",
  "text": "This week, eclipse chasers will be visiting the small town of Exmouth, at the tip of North West Cape in Western Australia. Weather permitting, they are coming to see one of nature's greatest sights\u2014a total eclipse of the sun on Thursday April 20.          Whether staying at hotels, resorts or camping sites, many would have made travel arrangements a year or more in advance. But don't be too disappointed if you can't be there; other opportunities to see total eclipses are coming up in the next few years. Here's what you need to know.A fully immersive experienceA total solar eclipse occurs on those rare occasions when the Moon lines up with the sun and passes in front of it from our vantage point here on Earth. The bright disk of the sun is entirely hidden for a short period\u2014seconds or minutes. During this time, called the totality, eclipse watchers will see a dark hole in the sky where the sun had been, surrounded by a faint glow\u2014our star's corona.This is what eclipse chasers seek to witness. The string of locations where a total eclipse will be visible to observers is called the \"path of totality.\" People will often travel thousands of kilometers to be in the right place at the right time. They are not only treated to the magnificent sight of the corona, but get a fully immersive experience.The sky rapidly darkens, the temperature drops, birds stop twittering and animals start going to sleep. The gathered observers, whether from your own group or from distant countries, are united in the experience.An addictive hobbyThere are two warnings associated with total solar eclipses. One is that chasing them is addictive. Often people who have seen their first eclipse immediately want to start planning to see their second.I can vouch for this personally\u2014after watching my first total eclipse on December 4, 2002, from the Woomera Rocket Range, I became most keen to observe another. Seeing the corona surrounding the dark sun come into view was an awe-inspiring experience, heightened by the fascinating location and the elation of fellow observers. My next eclipse was on August 1, 2008, at an even more interesting location\u2014a beach on the shore of the Novosibirsk Reservoir in Siberia; and most recently, I watched the Far North Queensland eclipse on November 14, 2012.The other warning is this: the only time it's safe to look directly at the sun is during the brief period of totality. All other times, during the partial phases before and after, it is necessary to take precautions.For this, special eclipse glasses are available from planetariums, public observatories, amateur astronomy groups and astronomy stores. Just make sure the glasses have the CE European standard mark.Taking photographs is safe, though only during totality unless you have the appropriate filters. A tripod is essential, as the corona is faint and you will need long exposures. Seasoned eclipse observers arrive at eclipse sites loaded with professional-grade cameras and telephoto lenses. But if it's your first time, it's probably better to just watch and absorb the event, rather than try photographing it.      Plan ahead and stay mobileAfter this week's eclipse in Australia, the next total solar eclipse will be visible on April 8, 2024, from the United States and Mexico. After passing through Mexico, the path of totality sweeps across the United States from Texas to Maine, before moving to parts of Canada.There are many potential viewing spots along the path. However, before picking a site, it's important to study the \"climate report\" for the eclipse. This grants the best chance of avoiding the eclipse watcher's greatest enemy\u2014clouds.However, even with the best advance planning, last-minute clouds are possible. Seasoned observers try to stay mobile, so that if the weather forecast is bad for their location, they can move to another location to avoid the clouds.The US total solar eclipse will be followed on August 12, 2026, with one where the path of totality passes over Spain and Iceland. Then there will be one on August 2, 2027, visible from Egypt and Saudi Arabia.An upcoming eclipse of greatest interest to Australians is the total solar eclipse on July 22, 2028, for which the path of totality passes from WA through the Northern Territory to New South Wales towns such as Bourke, Dubbo and Mudgee before reaching Sydney. It is rare for a major city to be in the path of totality, and the five million people of Sydney will get a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to view a total solar eclipse from their homes or backyards.Of course, like at any other eclipse, clouds are a possibility, so keep a lookout for weather reports closer to the date. Before eclipse day, look at the forecasts from the Bureau of Meteorology and specialized astronomy websites.As mentioned, for serious eclipse observers, mobility before a total eclipse is essential. For example, at the November 14, 2012, eclipse in Far North Queensland, a Sydney Observatory group made a successful last minute dash inland to avoid the forecast poor weather.Clouds, however, are not all bad. For the same eclipse, I was at Palm Cove Beach and fortunately, the clouds parted just at the start of totality. The excitement involved made for a fantastic and unique experience.If you are not at North West Cape this week and want to experience the wonders of a future total solar eclipse, you may want to start planning now.

  "answer_race": " Astronomers use strange units",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the asteroid that is set to fly near Earth?",
  "answer_squad": " 18 platypus",
  "text": "You may have heard about an asteroid set to fly near Earth that is the size of 18 platypus, or maybe the one that's the size of 33 armadillos, or even one the size of 22 tuna fish.          These outlandish comparisons are the invention of Jerusalem Post journalist Aaron Reich (who bills himself as \"creator of the giraffe metric\"), but real astronomers sometimes measure celestial objects with units that are just as strange.The idea of a planet that's 85% the mass of Earth seems straightforward. But what about a pulsar-wind nebula with a brightness of a few milliCrab? That's where things get weird.Why do astronomers use such strange units?The basic problem is that lots of things in space are way too big for our familiar units.Take my whippet Astro, who is 94cm long. Earth's radius is about 638 million cm, or 7.5 million Astros.Jupiter's radius is 11.2 Earths, or 85 million Astros. That number of Astros is a bit ridiculous, which is why we adjust our unit choice to one that makes more sense.At an even larger scale, consider the star Betelguese: its radius is 83,000 Earths, or 764 times the radius of the sun. So if we want to talk about how big Betelgeuse is, it's much more convenient to use the radius of the sun as our unit, instead of the radius of Earth (or to describe it as 632 billion Astros).Heavy stuffIf we want to measure how heavy an asteroid is, we could do it with camels\u2014but in space we're more interested in mass than in weight. Mass is a measure of how much stuff something is made of.On Earth the weight of an object, like Astro, depends on the mass of Astro and the gravitational force pulling him down to the ground.We can think of weight in terms of how hard it is to lift an 18kg Astro off the ground. This would be easy to do on Earth, even easier somewhere with lower gravity like the moon, and much harder somewhere with higher gravity like Jupiter.On the other hand, Astro's mass is how much stuff he's made of\u2014and it's the same no matter which planet he's on.Astronomers use Earth and the sun as handy units to measure mass. For example, the Andromeda galaxy is approximately three trillion times the mass of the sun (or 3\u00d71041\u2014that's a 3 followed by 41 zeros\u2014Astros).                A platypus that is approximately 1/18th of the size of Asteroid 2023 FH7. Credit: Stefan Kraft / Wikimedia, CC BY-SA Astronomical units and parsecsAstronomers also use comparisons to measure how far apart things are. The sun and Earth are 149 million kilometers apart, and we give this distance a name: an astronomical unit (AU).For an even twistier unit of distance, we use the parsec (insert Han Solo Kessel run joke here). Parsec is short for \"parallax second,\" and if you remember your trigonometry, this is the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angle triangle when the angle is 1 arcsecond (1/3,600 degrees) and the \"opposite\" side of the triangle is 1 AU.Parsecs are handy for measuring even bigger distances because 1 parsec = 206,265 AU. For example, the center of our very own galaxy, the Milky Way, is about 8,000 parsecs away from Earth, or 1.6 million AU.MagnitudesIf we want to measure how bright something is, astronomical units of measurement get even weirder. In the second century BC, the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus looked up at space and gave the brightest stars a value of 1 and the faintest stars a value of 6.Notice here that a brighter star has a lower number. We call these brightness values \"magnitudes.\" The sun has an apparent magnitude of \u201326!Even more confusing than a negative brightness, each single step in magnitude is a 2.512 times difference in brightness. The star Vega has an apparent magnitude of 0, which is two and a bit times brighter than the star Antares with an apparent magnitude of 1.At last, the milliCrabThe light we see with our eyes is, for obvious reasons, called \"visible\" light. The light we use to take pictures of your bones is called X-ray light.When astronomers use X-ray light to observe the sky we sometimes measure brightness in \"Crabs.\"The Crab is a rapidly spinning neutron star (or pulsar) in the remains of an exploded star that is extremely bright when we look at it using our X-ray telescopes. It's so bright in X-ray light that astronomers have been using it to calibrate their telescopes since the 1970s.So every X-ray astronomer knows how bright a Crab is. And if we're talking about a particular object, say a black hole binary system called GX339-4, and it's only five thousandths as bright as the Crab, we say it's 5 milliCrab bright.But buyer beware! The brightness of the Crab is different depending on what energy of X-ray light you're looking at, and it also changes over time.Whether we use lions or tigers or Crabs, astronomers make sure to define the units we're using. There's no use using an armadillo, or even your local whippet, unless you've made sure the definition is clear.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards the latest SETI research?",
  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the project that was led by Yuri Uno?",
  "answer_squad": " Breakthrough Listen",
  "text": "It has been more than sixty years since Dr. Frank Drake (father of the Drake Equation) and his colleagues mounted the first Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) survey. This was known as Project Ozma, which relied on the \"Big Ear\" radio telescope at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Greenbank, West Virginia, to look for signs of radio transmissions in Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani. Despite the many surveys conducted since then, no definitive evidence of technological activity (i.e., \"technosignatures\") has been found.          This naturally raises the all-important question: are we going about the business of SETI wrong? Instead of looking for technosignatures within our galaxy, as all previous SETI surveys have done, should we look for activity beyond our galaxy (from possible Type II and Type III civilizations)? This premise was explored in a recent paper led by researchers from the National Chung Hsing University in Taiwan. Using data from the largest SETI project to date, Breakthrough Listen, the team looked for potential radio technosignatures from extragalactic sources.The research team was led by Yuri Uno, a Ph.D. physics student at the National Chung Hsing University (NCHU) in Taichung, Taiwan. She was joined by an international team of astronomers and astrophysicists from the National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) in Hsinchu, Taiwan; The Australian National University (ANU), and the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ). The paper that describes their research and findings recently appeared in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.A key consideration for the team's study is the Kardashev Scale, the scheme for classifying extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) proposed by Soviet astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1964. According to Kardashev, ETIs could be classified into three \"types\" based on the amount of energy they can harness.Type I\u2014\"Planetary civilizations\" capable of harnessing and storing all of their home planet's energy (4\u00d71019 erg/sec).Type II\u2014\"Stellar civilizations\" capable of harnessing all the energy emitted by their star (4\u00d71033 erg/sec)Type III\u2014\"Galactic civilizations\" capable of harnessing the energy of an entire galaxy (4\u00d71044 erg/sec).To date, the majority of SETI studies were focused (implicitly or explicitly) on activities consistent with a Type I civilization. Aside from limited speculation about transiting megastructures, like the mysterious dimming of KIC 8462852 (aka Tabby's Star), attempts to look for possible Type II and Type III technosignatures has been very limited. According to the Taiwanese team, this leaves SETI surveys very limited in terms of the search area and overlooks potential technosignatures that would be very luminous. As Ono explained to Universe Today via email:      \"Most SETI surveys have focused solely on stars within our galaxy and have primarily searched for radio signals, assuming that other civilizations are similar to ours and use radio communication. However, this approach is less efficient regarding the number of observable stars because observations are conducted one by one out of 100 billion stars in our galaxy. Also, this approach may not be comprehensive enough to detect more advanced hypothetical civilizations that could handle strong radio signals in other galaxies.\"To address these limitations, Ono and her team focused on expanding the search beyond our galaxy and considered the possibility of highly advanced civilizations. These civilizations would be capable of sending several orders of magnitude more information over much greater distances, greatly increasing the odds of detection. According to Kardashev's original paper, a Type II civilization would be capable of transmitting 3\u00d7109 bits/sec within a 100,000 light-year radius from their star system, 3\u00d7105 bits/sec within a 1 million light-year radius, but nothing beyond that.A Type III civilization would be capable of transmitting at a rate of 2.4\u00d71015 to 2.4\u00d71013 bits/sec within a 100,000 and 10 million light-year radius and 3\u00d71010 bits/sec within a 10 billion light-years radius. For their study, Uno and her team examined data obtained by Breakthrough Listen (BL) since it began in 2016. Specifically, they conducted a statistical analysis of the non-detection results reported by BL. As Uno explained, the lack of detection allowed the BL team to establish upper limits on the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations based on the number of stars they observed:\"However, the radio telescopes' field of view was much larger than the apparent size of the target stars, allowing them to simultaneously observe other galaxies in the background. Therefore, we analyzed the number of stellar systems based on the background galaxies, assuming that advanced civilizations would have the capacity to send us signals from other galaxies. Our statistical analysis suggests that BL may have observed hundreds of trillions of stellar systems.\"By taking into account background galaxies from previously-observed SETI fields, Uno and her colleagues found that the number of observed stars was much greater than previously reported. In fact, they found that the total number was about ten orders of magnitude (n10) greater than previous studies that focused on individual stars in our galaxy. However, as Uno explained, their results indicated that the number of civilizations in our local universe that we might have a shot of hearing from was staggeringly low:\"Our statistical method suggests that less than one in hundreds of trillions of extragalactic civilizations within 969 Mpc possess a radio transmitter above 7.7 x 1026 W of power, assuming one civilization per one-solar-mass stellar system. Additionally, we cross-matched the BL survey fields with the WISE SuperCOSMOS Photometric Redshift Catalog and compared [it] with the statistical method. Our result sets the strictest limits to date on the transmitter rate at such high power levels, emphasizing the high efficiency of searching for radio transmitters in galaxies and the rarity of technologically advanced civilizations in our universe.\"Granted, this latest statistical analysis might sound like bad news. But it's important to note that research that establishes limits on the likelihood of finding extraterrestrial civilizations is essential to SETI research. This is what SETI forerunner Dr. Frank Drake attempted to capture with his famous Drake Equation, which established theoretical limits on the number of ETIs humanity could communicate within our galaxy. By extending those limits beyond the Milky Way, Uno and her colleagues have established theoretical constraints that are many orders of magnitude higher.What's more, Uno stressed that this latest analysis only covers a fraction of the known universe and is subject to significant limitations in frequency and duration. What's more, she says, it presents new opportunities for SETI research:\"It is important to note that even though this was the largest SETI search ever conducted, it covered only a fraction of the sky (0.05%), a fraction of frequency (0.5%) and limited time duration (five minutes). Moreover, there are other parameters to consider, such as timing and direction, and we cannot immediately conclude that we are alone in the universe.\"Previous works are limited by the small number of observed stars. In this paper, we demonstrated how efficient the extragalactic SETI search is in terms of the number of observable stars. Therefore, I believe that extragalaxies are the frontier of SETI research, and we must continue our SETI search to understand the possibility of other civilizations better.\" More information:Yuri Uno et al, Upper limits on transmitter rate of extragalactic civilizations placed by breakthrough listen observations, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (2023).

  "text": "Stars that contain comparatively large amounts of heavy elements provide less favorable conditions for the emergence of complex life than metal-poor stars, as scientists from the Max Planck Institutes for Solar System Research and for Chemistry as well as from the University of G\u00f6ttingen have now found.          The team showed how the metallicity of a star is connected to the ability of its planets to surround themselves with a protective ozone layer. Crucial to this is the intensity of the ultraviolet light that the star emits into space, in different wavelength ranges. The study provides scientists searching the sky with space telescopes for habitable star systems with important clues as to where this endeavor could be particularly promising.It also suggests a startling conclusion: as the universe ages, it becomes increasingly unfriendly to the emergence of complex life on new planets.In the search for habitable or even inhabited planets orbiting distant stars, researchers have in the past years increasingly focused on the gas envelopes of these worlds. Do observational data show evidence of an atmosphere? Does it perhaps even contain gases such as oxygen or methane, which on Earth are produced almost exclusively as metabolic products of lifeforms?In the next years, such observations will be pushed to new limits: Nasa's James Webb Telescope will make it possible to not only characterize the atmospheres of large gas giants like Super-Neptunes, but also to analyze for the first time the much fainter spectrographic signals from rocky planet atmospheres.With the help of numerical simulations, the current study, which was published in Nature Communications today, now turns to the ozone content of exoplanet atmospheres. As on Earth, this compound of three oxygen atoms can protect the planet's surface (and life forms residing on it) from cell-damaging ultraviolet (UV) radiation.A protective layer of ozone is thus an important prerequisite for the emergence of complex life. \"We wanted to understand what properties a star must have in order for its planets to form a protective ozone layer,\" Anna Shapiro, scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research and first author of the current study, explains the basic idea.As often in science, this idea was triggered by an earlier finding. Three years ago, researchers led by the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research had compared the sun's brightness variations with those of hundreds of sun-like stars. The result: the intensity of the visible light from many of these stars fluctuates much more strongly than in the case of the sun. \"We saw huge peaks in intensity,\" says Alexander Shapiro, who was involved in both the analyses from three years ago and the current study.\"It is therefore quite possible, that the sun, too, is capable of such spikes in intensity. In that case, also the intensity of the ultraviolet light would increase dramatically,\" he adds. \"So naturally we wondered, what this would mean for life on Earth and what the situation is like in other star systems,\" says Sami Solanki, director at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research and co-author of both studies.      Dual role of UV radiationAt the surface of about half of all stars around which exoplanets have been shown to orbit, temperatures range from about 5,000 to about 6,000 degrees Celsius. In their calculations, the researchers therefore turned to this subgroup. With a surface temperature of approximately 5500 degrees Celsius, the sun is also one of them. \"In the Earth's atmospheric chemistry, ultraviolet radiation from the sun plays a dual role,\" explains Anna Shapiro, whose past research interest focused on the influence of solar radiation on Earth's atmosphere.In reactions with individual oxygen atoms and oxygen molecules, ozone can both be created and destroyed. While long-wave UV-B radiation destroys ozone, short-wave UV-C radiation helps create protective ozone in the middle atmosphere. \"It was therefore reasonable to assume that ultraviolet light may have a similarly complex influence on exoplanet atmospheres as well,\" the astronomer adds. The precise wavelengths are crucial.The researchers therefore calculated exactly which wavelengths make up the ultraviolet light emitted by the stars. For the first time, they also considered the influence of metallicity. This property describes the ratio of hydrogen to heavier elements (simplistically and somewhat misleadingly called \"metals\" by astrophysicists) in the building material of the star. In the case of the sun, there are more than 31000 hydrogen atoms for every iron atom. The study also considered stars with lower and higher iron content.Simulated interactions of UV radiation with gasesIn a second step, the team investigated how the calculated UV radiation would affect the atmospheres of planets orbiting at a life-friendly distance around these stars. Life-friendly distances are those that allow moderate temperatures\u2014neither too hot nor too cold for liquid water\u2014at the planet's surface. For such worlds, the team simulated on the computer exactly which processes the parent star's characteristic UV light sets in motion in the planet's atmosphere.To compute the composition of planetary atmospheres the researchers used a chemistry-climate model that simulates the processes that control oxygen, ozone, and many other gases, and their interactions with ultraviolet light from stars, at very high spectral resolution. This model allowed the investigation of a wide variety of conditions on exoplanets and comparison with the history of the Earth's atmosphere in the last half billion years.During this period the high atmospheric oxygen content and the ozone layer were established that allowed the evolution of life on land on our planet. \"It is feasible that the history of the Earth and its atmosphere holds clues about the evolution of life that may also apply to exoplanets,\" says Jos Lelieveld, Managing Director of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, who was involved in the study.Promising candidatesThe results of the simulations were surprising for the scientists. Overall, metal-poor stars emit more UV radiation than their metal-rich counterparts. But the ratio of ozone-generating UV-C radiation to ozone-destroying UV-B radiation also depends critically on metallicity: in metal-poor stars, UV-C radiation predominates, allowing a dense ozone layer to form. For metal-rich stars, with their predominant UV-B radiation, this protective envelope is much more sparse.\"Contrary to expectations, metal-poor stars should thus provide more favorable conditions for the emergence of life,\" Anna Shapiro concludes.This finding could be helpful for future space missions such as Esa's Plato mission, which will comb through a vast array of stars for signs of habitable exoplanets. With 26 telescopes on board, the eponymous probe will be launched into space in 2026 and will focus its attention primarily on Earth-like planets orbiting sun-like stars at life-friendly distances.The mission's data center is currently being set up at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research. \"Our current study gives us valuable clues as to which stars Plato should pay special attention to,\" says Laurent Gizon, Managing Director at the Institute and co-author of the current study.Paradoxical conclusionMoreover, the study yields an almost paradoxical conclusion: as the universe ages, it is likely to become increasingly hostile to life. Metals and other heavy elements are formed inside stars at the end of their several-billion-year lifetimes and\u2014depending on the mass of the star\u2014are released into space as stellar wind or in a supernova explosion: the building material for the next generation of stars.\"Each newly forming star therefore has more metal-rich building material available than its predecessors. Stars in the universe are becoming more metal-rich with each generation,\" says Anna Shapiro. According to the new study, the probability that star systems will produce life thus also decreases as the universe ages. However, the search for life is not hopeless. After all, many host stars of exoplanets have a similar age as the sun. And this star is indeed known to harbor complex and interesting lifeforms on at least one of its planets.

  "text": "Using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), astronomers have discovered a new massive brown dwarf. The newfound object is nearly 80 times more massive than Jupiter and orbits an M-dwarf star known as TOI-5375. The finding was presented in a paper published April 10 on the arXiv pre-print server.          Brown dwarfs (BDs) are intermediate objects between planets and stars, occupying the mass range between 13 and 80 Jupiter masses (0.012 and 0.076 solar masses). Although many brown dwarfs have been detected to date, such objects orbiting other stars are a rare find.Recently, a transit signal has been observed with TESS in the light curve of TOI-5375 (also known as TIC 71268730)\u2014an active M dwarf located some 400 light years away. A team of astronomers led by Jesus Maldonado of the Palermo Astronomical Observatory in Italy, has found that this signal is caused by a massive substellar object using space-based photometric observations from TESS combined with high-precision radial velocities from ground-based facilities.\"We reveal the presence of a companion in the brown dwarf/very-low-mass star boundary orbiting around the star TOI-5375,\" the researchers wrote in the paper.The newfound companion received designation TOI-5375 b. The object is the size of Jupiter and its mass is estimated to be 77 Jupiter masses, which yields a density at a level of 98 g/cm3. It orbits the star every 1.72 days, at a distance of 0.025 AU from it. The equilibrium temperature of TOI-5375 b is assumed to be within the range of 931\u20131,107 K.Based on its derived properties, Maldonado's team classified TOI-5375 b as a massive brown dwarf. The researchers noted that the newly detected object in the boundary between the brown dwarfs and the very-low-mass stars. The discovery of TOI-5375 b is important for astronomers investigating the brown dwarf/star boundary as massive substellar companions orbiting around M dwarfs are rarely found.The host star has a spectral type M0.5, and is about 37% smaller and less massive than the sun. The star has a rotational period of approximately 1.97 days and its effective temperature was calculated to be about 3,800 K.Based on the star's rotational period, the authors of the paper concluded that the orbit of TOI-5375 b decays relatively quickly. They assume that the system should be in the phase in which the star is very close to synchronizing its rotation with the orbital period of the companion.Summing up the results, the researchers propose further observations of the system using space observatories like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Such studies could improve our knowledge regarding the atmospheres of massive brown dwarfs and low-mass stars. More information:J. Maldonado et al, The GAPS programme at TNG XLV.

  "text": "An international team of scientists, led by a researcher at The University of Manchester, have developed a novel AI (artificial intelligence) approach to distill technical astronomy terminology into simple understandable English in their recent publication.          The new research is a result of the international RGZ EMU (Radio Galaxy Zoo EMU) collaboration and is transitioning radio astronomy language from specific terms, such as FRI (Fanaroff-Riley Type 1), to plain English terms such as \"hourglass\" or \"traces host galaxy.\"The paper is published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.In astronomy, technical terminology is used to describe specific ideas in efficient ways that are easily understandable among professional astronomers. However, this same terminology can also become a barrier to including non-experts in the conversation. The RGZ EMU collaboration is building a project on the Zooniverse citizen science platform, which asks the public for help in describing and categorizing galaxies imaged through a radio telescope.Modern astronomy projects collect so much data that it is often impossible for scientists to look at it all by themselves, and a computer analysis can still miss interesting things easily spotted by the human eye.Micah Bowles, Lead author and RGZ EMU data scientist, said, \"Using AI to make scientific language more accessible is helping us share science with everyone. With the plain English terms we derived, the public can engage with modern astronomy research like never before and experience all the amazing science being done around the world.\"Radio telescopes work in a very similar way to satellite dishes, but instead of picking up television signals they can be used to pick up the radio light generated by very energetic astrophysical objects\u2014such as black holes in other galaxies. For many decades, these \"radio galaxies\" have been categorized into different types by astronomers to help them understand the origins and evolution of the universe.Recently, dramatic improvements to radio telescopes around the world have revealed more and more of these radio galaxies, not only making it impossible for professional astronomers to look at each one individually and categorize it, but also introducing new variations that aren't already captured by existing radio galaxy types. Instead of trying to invent more and more new technical terminology for different types of radio galaxy\u2014and train people to recognize them\u2014the RGZ EMU team saw a different path forward that would enable citizen scientists to participate more fully in their research project.The RGZ EMU team first asked experts to describe a selection of radio galaxies with their technical terms, and then asked non-experts to describe them in plain English. Using a first-of-its-kind AI-based approach they had developed, they then identified the plain English descriptions that carried the most scientific information. These descriptions(\"tags\") can now be used by anyone to describe radio galaxies\u2014in a way which is meaningful for any English speaker\u2014without any specialist training at all. This work will not only be crucial for the RGZ EMU project, but with ever-increasing volumes of data across many areas of science, this new AI approach could find use in many more situations where simplified language can accelerate research, collaboration and communication.Led from Manchester, this research was conducted by researchers from the UK, China, Germany, the U.S., the Netherlands, Australia, Mexico, and Pakistan. The data, code and results are all available online.

  "text": "Space travel has brought us to our next-door neighbor, the moon, and to the depths of our larger solar community inhabited by giants such as Saturn and Jupiter.          In 1982, Voyager 2 whisked past Uranus closer than any other spacecraft has since, and now is sailing\u201446 years after its launch\u2014through interstellar space, some 133 AU (approximately 19.9 billion km) from Earth.But there have been few comparable satellite missions in recent years. Cost is the main obstacle, but time frame is also a factor. The design for such long journeys takes years to calculate, and planning and construction of a space vehicle would take about a decade. Factoring in the time a satellite would require to reach distant targets means our next peek into the stars will likely not come any time soon.A team of scientists led by Slava Turyshev of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, which launched the Voyager satellites back in 1977, is anxious to get space exploration back on track. The team proposes a novel means of travel that could get us to the stars faster and cheaper.In a paper released on the arXiv preprint server, Turyshev and more than two dozen fellow researchers from the United States and Europe proposed merging miniature satellite units with a solar energy process that would create a fast, inexpensive, lightweight mode of travel.Solar sailing is a process by which the pressure generated by the sun's radiation is harnessed for propulsion. Recent innovations in this technology were demonstrated in a successful crowdfunded 2019 mission undertaken by the Planetary Society's LightSail-2 project.The researchers explain, \"Solar sails obtain thrust by using highly reflective, lightweight materials that reflect sunlight to propel a spacecraft while in space. The continuous photon pressure from the sun provides thrust, eliminating the need for heavy, expendable propellants employed by conventional on-board chemical and electric propulsion systems, which limit mission lifetime and observation locations.\"They say that sails are far less expensive than heavy equipment currently used for propulsion, and that the ever-present continuous solar photon pressure from the sun makes thrust available for a broad range of vehicular maneuvers, such as hovering or rapid orbital plane changes.Solar sails and miniaturization \"have advanced in the past decade to the point where they may enable inspiring and affordable missions to reach farther and faster, deep into the outer regions of our solar system,\" the report says.The researchers refer to the merging of these two technologies as the Sundiver Concept.\"Fast, cost-effective and maneuverable sailcraft that may travel outside the ecliptic plane open new opportunities for affordable solar system exploration,\" the report states, \"with great promise for heliophysics, planetary science, and astrophysics.\"With enhanced maneuverability, the spacecraft can easily deliver small payloads to multiple destinations if required, and can dock with related modular craft. The reliance on the sun and the miniaturization of the carrier, which requires no dedicated launch site, will prove to be significant cost savers, the researchers add: \"A substantial reason for the high costs is our [current] reliance on slow and expensive chemical propulsion, operating at the limits of its capabilities, effectively rendering the current solar system exploration paradigm unsustainable. A new approach is needed.\"The Universe Today web site observed this week that with the project gaining support from NASA, in a few years we may \"begin to see a fleet of ultra-fast solar sailing probes zipping throughout the solar system. That would be quite a sight.\" More information:Slava G. Turyshev et al, Science opportunities with solar sailing smallsats, arXiv (2023).

  "text": "When astronauts return to the moon in the next few years, the plan is to have them stay for good while establishing a permanent outpost on Earth's nearest celestial neighbor. Like all space missions, a lunar outpost will require fuel for long-term sustainability, but would it be better to mine fuel on the moon or get fuel resupply from the Earth? This is what a team of researchers led by Bocconi University in Italy hope to address as they addressed the best option in terms of deriving fuel from either the Earth or the moon.          Mattia Pianorsi, who is a junior researcher of the Space Economy Laboratory at the SDA Boccini School of Management and a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of St. Gallen, recently told Universe Today the main objective of the study was to ascertain the economic and technical feasibility of mining fuel from the moon's water ice deposits or from the Earth.Both options would use an orbiting depot (OD) which Pianorsi says would be used \"as a distribution channel for satellites as well as rockets in space.\" The OD, which is separate from NASA's proposed Lunar Gateway and is also not mentioned in the study, would possess a maximum fuel capacity of 25 tons and be located at the Earth-moon Lagrange Point L1 which is approximately three-quarters the distance between the Earth and the moon.For the study, the researchers conducted a Monte Carlo analysis to evaluate the risks associated with both options. For their scenario, the researchers used hypothetical variables such as a lunar mining company, a transporter/distributor company, and end-users.The hypothetical lunar mining company charges fuel at $500 per kilogram while for the Earth refueling option a transporter purchases the fuel from the Earth at a negligible cost. Both options considered fixed costs, including Design, Development, Testing, and Evaluation (DDT&E), Manufacturing, and Transportation, while the recurring costs included Refueling and Operations.The researchers determined the Earth refueling option would involve approximately 1.5 launches of a Falcon Heavy (FH) Expendable plus propellant tank with a spacecraft refueling payload of 17.5 tons. While the OD has a capacity of 25 tons, the FH would need to bring a combined total of 26.69 tons as the remaining 1.69 tons of fuel would be used to \"transfer the refilling tank with its subsystems,\" according to the study.As stated, the fuel costs are negligible, but the launch costs are estimated to be $150 million per launch, putting a total refueling price tag at $227.9 million, which includes launch plus fuel costs. The estimated launch costs also totaled $6511.4 per kilogram with a total operation cost of $42.38 million per year.For the moon refueling option, the researchers used a hypothetical moon shuttle built by the Cislunar Space Development Company (CSDC) with a payload of 25 tons that launches from the moon, docks and refuels the OD to its maximum capacity of 25 tons , then returns to the lunar surface, with the assumption that zero fuel is lost during the entire process.As stated, the hypothetical lunar mining company put the fuel costs at $500 per kilogram, and the study put the total refueling price tag at $37.51 million dollars, which includes launch plus fuel costs, giving a total operation cost of $35 million per year.Based on these results, the researchers concluded that refueling the OD is more affordable from the moon than from the Earth.\"So, if you want to put this project into real substance, it should be able to understand and to analyze data from a project financing point of view,\" Pianorsi recently told Universe Today.\"So it's the same logic under which you finance the infrastructure here on Earth, you have to understand how to incentivize your investors to jump in on the basis of the mitigation of the risk that you that you put in place, for instance, through contracts. So, this is a very important thing to do if you want to develop infrastructure, involving not only the public money, and maybe the money of the corporates, but even the money of financial investors. And I don't speak about venture capital or private equity, I speak about institutional investors,\" Pianorsi tells Universe Today that he believes these factors should be the next steps in terms of research.As for the upcoming Artemis missions, Pianorsi emphasized to Universe Today the importance of \"creating an economic cycle between the Earth and the moon\" but also emphasized the importance of not just having space agencies and space companies conducting lunar and Mars activities, but non-space companies, as well.\"The companies need to understand that economic sustainability is the new prerogative of the new space economy,\" Pianorsi tells Universe Today. \"It's not anymore cost-plus contracts of NASA. Right now, the times are changing and even space agencies, especially in times of budget constraints, need to rely on private companies to make innovation and to improve efficiency. And this implies not only from a cost perspective, but even from a market perspective.\"The research is published in the journal Acta Astronautica.

  "text": "The New Horizons mission currently flying through the Kuiper Belt could be facing an unexpected change of plans. NASA's Science Mission Directorate is soliciting input on turning the spacecraft into a heliospheric science probe. The agency wants to do it much sooner than mission planners intended. If that happens, it will stop further planned planetary exploration of objects in that distant regime of the solar system.          The changes NASA proposes come as a surprise since the spacecraft continues to perform Kuiper Belt object observations. And, it has received a very good recent senior science review. That report stated, \"This is likely the only spacecraft humans will send through the outer solar system for at least 20\u201330 years. The investigations proposed are strengthened by the unique position of this asset.\"More Kuiper Belt studiesTo date, the mission continues to accomplish its planned science goals in planetary exploration. \"We're doing a variety of Kuiper Belt science\u2014including tracing the dust distribution from colliding KBOs out much farther than ever before,\" said Principal Investigator Alan Stern. \"We're studying new, more distant KBOs from angles and closer ranges that you can't get from Earth to determine their surface properties, their satellite counts, and shapes, things that cannot be done well except by a spacecraft in the Kuiper Belt. And of course, we're on the prowl for a new flyby target if one can be found.\"Stern points out that the mission has, through 2022, observed and characterized 36 Kuiper Belt objects. In addition, it has studied several dwarf planets from its unique vantage point in the Belt. Data from those observations help calculate the shapes, orbits, and surface textures of these very distant bodies.What the science teams have found so far will help place some important constraints on KBO formation mechanisms. Future observations should also help the teams understand the processes driving the surface evolution and compositional differences between various KBOs.Building on New Horizons observations of Pluto and ArrokothScience also continues to flow from the mission's earlier discoveries, as reported at the March Lunar and Planetary Science conference. For example, the team may have figured out how the primitive Kuiper Belt object Arrokoth formed by gentle accretion. They've also been tracking the phenomenon of polar wander on Pluto. It turns out that the surface feature Sputnik Planitia may play a role.The spacecraft is well placed to \"look back\" and capture views of Uranus and Neptune. Those observations will be done in tandem with the Hubble Space Telescope. In addition, New Horizons will continue its planned studies of the heliosphere. Finally, it will continue to map the cosmic background in optical and ultraviolet light. In other words, there's plenty for the spacecraft to do in astrophysics, cosmology, and solar system sciences.      Searching for the next targetSince the Arrokoth encounter, the team's been hunting for another flyby target. According to Stern, it's been an intense search. \"We're twice as far out from Earth as when we found Arrokoth, which makes the targets we search for sixteen times farther. So, the search is much harder,\" he said. \"This is the only chance we've got to do Kuiper Belt science for decades and we need time to find the next target.\"That hunt uses enhanced equipment on ground-based telescopes and also takes advantage of machine-learning AI software. The Subaru Telescope in Hawai'i has a new high-throughput filter on its giant Hyper Suprime-Cam digital camera. The New Horizons team specifically purchased that filter to use in the KBO search. The Dark Energy Camera instrument at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile is another tool in the hunt. Those facilities should be able to find what amounts to a needle in the Kuiper Belt haystack. If the team finds an object along the New Horizons trajectory, they'll spool up planning for its observations.Proposed changes from NASASo given the current successes, why is NASA looking to discontinue planetary science using New Horizons? The first hints about this proposed change came when the agency sent word that the current extended mission will end on October 1, 2024. Originally, the team asked for funding to continue Kuiper Belt science through 2025. However, in May 2022, NASA informed the team of the cutback to only two years of further exploration. The team is working to get the third year back. This is important since the mission will be traversing the Kuiper Belt until at least 2027\u20132028. That gives plenty of time to do more planetary science.Other hints of possible changes came in another NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) suggestion. This one is to move the mission from the Planetary Science section to the agency's Heliophysics division. SMD also issued a request for Information (RFI) on March 15, 2023. It states, \"SMD is exploring whether interested science teams have a set of science objectives to propose to NASA for use of the mission beyond FY24. The purpose of this RFI is to gauge the level of interest of the wider science community in pursuing the next phase of science leadership for the mission, and to estimate appropriate annual costs.\"The SMD request for input from the larger science community seems focused on what to do with the mission (and its team) now that the Pluto and Arrokoth flybys are over. It doesn't acknowledge that New Horizons hasn't finished its survey of the Kuiper Belt. Plus, it's still actively doing planetary science there.Presenting the changesAt an SMD question-and-answer session on April 6th, Planetary Science Division director Lori Glaze acknowledged the mission extension proposal for operations past Fiscal Year 2024. She also noted that it received a good senior review as a multi-disciplinary approach for planetary science, astrophysics, and heliophysics.Glaze stated, \"[The review] says that the probability of additional science return for planetary science with New Horizons spacecraft is quickly diminishing and that there's very little additional planetary science that we can gain from the spacecraft.\" Glaze also pointed out that the astrophysics and heliophysics divisions evaluated the same review. \"They did identify significant heliophysics science that could be done from this unique location in the solar system,\" she said.The actual review she refers to says something slightly different. It states that proposed KBO studies are unlikely to dramatically improve the state of knowledge. This is a statement some planetary scientists have characterized as a naive assumption. But, it does not say specifically that there's very little planetary science to be gained. It also goes on to point out that an extended mission would support all the planetary science, plus astrophysical and heliophysics objectives outlined in the 2003 Decadal Survey.Truncating valuable planetary science?Despite the favorable reviews and mission accomplishments, the proposed plan to abruptly stop doing planetary science with New Horizons and turn it into a heliospheric mission will be devastating. According to Stern, if a further extension is not granted, it amounts to a truncation of New Horizons Kuiper Belt planetary science years too early.\"New Horizons is a national treasure,\" he said. \"We'll never get another Kuiper Belt extension if it goes to Heliophysics Division. Right now, we need to exploit this mission for every bit of planetary and particularly Kuiper Belt science we can get while we're still in the Kuiper Belt.\"Historically, the exploration of this regime of the solar system came from a prime recommendation of the 2003 Planetary Decadal Survey. It recommended a Pluto-Kuiper Belt explorer mission as a way to study solar system history, volatiles, and organics in the solar system. The survey report specifically stated that \"KBP's value increases as it observes more KBOs and investigates the diversity of properties.\"It further points out that \"The SSE Survey anticipates that the information returned from this mission might lead to a new paradigm for the origin and evolution of these objects and their significance in the evolution of objects in other parts of the solar system.\"That survey led to the creation of the New Horizons mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt. Its prime aims were to do as much planetary science in the Belt as possible. It also included robust heliophysics and astrophysical components from the beginning. So far, it has accomplished all those types of observations and more.What's lost if New Horizons KBO Mission gets shortened?According to Mark Sykes, a planetary scientist and CEO and Director of the Planetary Science Institute, the potential loss of planetary science from New Horizons is a big deal. \"It has a collection of instruments and a team that's operating now that knows best how they operate, their sensitivities, and so on,\" he said. \"New Horizons is the one opportunity we have to study these objects in their primordial state in the region where they have resided frozen for the age of the solar system.\"\"Four years ago New Horizons flew by the first such object ever seen, Arrokoth,\" he said. \"The most important thing NASA can do now is to make every effort to find a second target for New Horizons to fly by. It is the only way we could get any clue about the physical diversity of these objects, which would greatly impact our understanding of the formation and evolution of the solar system.\"Sykes points out that the search for a flyby target is high risk. \"There might not be a target close enough to New Horizons' flight path. But, the very high payback and the marginal cost of the effort is tiny compared to the billion dollars already invested by taxpayers in this mission,\" he said. \"While they hunt, there are a lot of unique planetary, astrophysical, and heliophysical observations that can be made. To not make these observations, to not make an effort in planetary, as well as astrophysics, and heliophysics with everything this spacecraft can do, to me, is a crime.\"Sykes also pointed out that the spacecraft's position in the Kuiper Belt provides the most unique look at dust distribution there. That's because it's taking in situ measurements. \"The dust tells you something about the collisional environment there, and provides a really important constraint in terms of what's going on,\" he said.What's next?For now, New Horizons has not yet been moved out of the planetary science portfolio. NASA is still soliciting input from the broader science community over the proposed move. The RFI ends on April 17th.The New Horizons team is working to get the planetary component extended. They also want to keep experienced mission scientists in place. Although the RFI doesn't state it directly, the wording seems to suggest that the Science Mission Directorate is looking to replace the current science team with new groups of scientists who will propose heliophysics science for the spacecraft moving forward. These researchers would not be as familiar with the mission instruments.Something like this has never been done to any spacecraft team before, said Stern. He fears that if new people are brought in to run the mission, the current team will be sent packing, unfunded and unaffiliated with the spacecraft they worked to build, launch, and operate. And, the loss to science is incalculable.\"If they shut it down as a planetary mission, it will be the end of Kuiper Belt exploration for several decades,\" he said. \"Cutting us off prematurely is exactly counter to what the Decadal Survey recommended.\"Planetary mission challengesThis challenge to New Horizons and its science team plays out against a backdrop of big budget issues at NASA. Just as one example, the agency is grappling with delays to the flagship Mars Science Return mission. There is talk about descoping it to save money. The Veritas mission just got delayed by three years. That's largely due to technical issues, as well as funding requirements for other missions.Budgetary constraints shouldn't be part of the New Horizons situation, according to Stern. \"Our budget request for another mission extension is around $10 million,\" he said. That's an amount the team requested to restore the fiscal year 2025 funding that NASA took away. He compared that to NASA's overall science budget of just under $8 billion. \"It's a drop in the bucket for the amazing science return we still hope to get.\" Provided byUniverse TodayCitation:NASA plans could threaten the future of New Horizons (2023, April 17)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-nasa-threaten-future-horizons.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Astronomers have investigated an ultraslow radio pulsar known as PSR J0901-4046, finding that it has an extremely high magnetic field\u2014at a level of 30 quadrillion Gauss. The discovery, published April 7 in Physical Review D, makes PSR J0901-4046 the most magnetized radio pulsar known to date.          Extraterrestrial sources of radiation with a regular periodicity, known as pulsars, are usually detected in the form of short bursts of radio emission. Radio pulsars are generally described as highly magnetized, rapidly rotating neutron stars with a lighthouse beam of radiation that produces the pulsed emission.PSR J0901-4046 was discovered on September 27, 2020, at 1284 MHz with the MeerKAT radio telescope and associated with an ultra-slowly rotating magnetized neutron star. It has an ultralong spin period of approximately 75.9 seconds\u2014therefore it rotates more than three times slower than the former record holder PSR J0250+5854.The strength of the surface magnetic field of PSR J0901-4046 was initially estimated to be at a level of 130 trillion Gauss, based on its period. However, further studies found that such a magnetic field is wholly insufficient for this pulsar to operate, excluding the hypothesis that PSR J0901-4046 may be a magnetar. Moreover, it remained unclear how such a slowly rotating source is still active in the radio band.That is why a team of astronomers led by Denis Sob'yanin of the P. N. Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, Russia, decided to take a closer look at PSR J0901-4046.\"In this paper we address the problem of the origin of radio emission from the apparently dead PSR J0901-4046. Eschewing the model of magnetic-dipole radiation and solely using energy transformation during plasma multiplication above the polar cap of a strongly magnetized rotating neutron star, we show that the actual surface magnetic field of PSR J0901-4046 is 2 orders of magnitude higher than the conventional estimate,\" the researchers explained.The study found that PSR J0901-4046 has a magnetic field of at least 27 quadrillion Gauss. Such a strong magnetic field explains the existence of plasma multiplication and the observed radio emission from this pulsar. Therefore, PSR J0901-4046 becomes the most magnetized radio pulsar so far discovered.The astronomers explained that the ultraslow rotation of PSR J0901-4046 implies that the surface magnetic field strength should exceed the value of 25 quadrillion Gauss. This is needed for an efficient cascade multiplication of an electron-positron plasma generating radio emission.The researchers added that the extremely strong magnetic field of PSR J0901-4046 indicates that the pulsar slows down not by magnetic-dipole radiation, but rather by an electric current of about 56 megaamperes, when rotational energy is expended in accelerating charged particles over the polar cap. In this scenario, the rotational energy of the neutron star fully transforms into the energy of primary particles in the acceleration gap, and not into the energy of magnetic-dipole radiation.

Around 12:18 p.m. ET Sunday, astronomer Kriszti\u00e1n S\u00e1rneczky detected an asteroid\u2014initially dubbed Sar2667\u2014at the Piszk\u00e9stet\u0151 Observatory in Hungary, the European Space Agency said in a news release. After a second observation was made minutes later, it was reported to the International Astronomical Union Minor Planet Center.'100% impact probability'About 40 minutes after the asteroid was discovered, the Vi\u0161njan Observatory in Croatia confirmed the object. The ESA said various impact assessment systems observed the asteroid and determined it has a \"100% impact probability\" above the English Channel\u2014the strip of the Atlantic Ocean between southern England and northern France.Luckily, astronomers said it was a 3-foot asteroid, officially named 2023 CX1, meaning it posed no threat to Earth or humanity.Asteroid 2023 CX1 hits Earth, turns into fireball seen throughout EuropeAstronomers around the world continued to observe the asteroid through Sunday night into Monday morning, spotting it until it became \"invisible\" as it fell into Earth's shadow, the ESA said.At 2:58 a.m. UT (9:58 p.m. ET), the asteroid entered Earth's atmosphere, turning into a \"beautiful fireball\" that streaked across the European skies. A fireball is another name for an usually bright meteor that has burned up in Earth's atmosphere, NASA says.The meteor was spotted throughout western Europe, as the International Meteor Organization said it received 61 reports of the fireball across Wales, England, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany.The ESA said its possible some fragments of the asteroid could have survived and made it near the coast north of Rouen in Normandy, France.Several videos of the fireball were posted on Twitter.Asteroids spotted just before hitting EarthOfficials said this was the seventh time an asteroid had been detected just before it hit Earth.One of the most recent instances also involved S\u00e1rneczky; in March 2022, a fridge-sized asteroid\u2014about 6 1/2 -feet-long\u2014hit Earth two hours after he initially spotted it.NASA's Asteroid Watch said although asteroids like 2023 CX1 aren't a threat to humanity, they are an \"excellent exercise\" of Earth's planetary defense capabilities, as the ESA added spotting these asteroids just before they hit Earth is \"a sign of the rapid advances in global detection capabilities.\"    (c)2023 USA Today      Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "text": "Extreme cold is merciless on machinery. Fluids thicken to useless goo. Rubber seals stiffen and crack.          The problems pile up as the temperature falls. Metal becomes brittle, and wires contract. Batteries stop working, adhesives stop sticking and LCD screens go black as their liquid crystal freezes solid.And that's just here on Earth.When NASA's new lunar rover lands on the moon's south pole next year, it will encounter a whole new kind of cold.Temperatures there hover around minus 280 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 173 degrees Celsius). In the permanent shadows of polar craters, it can fall to minus 388 F (minus 233 C).For context, Antarctica's Vostok Station holds the record for the lowest temperature ever recorded on this planet: minus 128.6 F (minus 89.2 C), recorded July 21, 1983. A typical day on the moon is about 150 degrees colder than the coldest it has ever been on Earth.Previous rovers for the moon and Mars\u2014which is also cold, averaging minus 80 F\u2014have been equipped with built-in heaters that switch on at the start of the lunar or Martian day and take several hours to warm enough for the machines to begin their daily tasks.That comes at a cost of time and energy, two precious commodities on any space mission. But what if you could build a rover that didn't need warm-up time?\"If you're able to work longer hours in one day, you'd be able to get more information,\" said Lacie Fradet, a project engineer at Motiv Space Systems in Pasadena, which is working with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to make this possible. If they succeed in building an arm that can operate in extremely cold regions, \"we will be able to go places we haven't gone before.\"The first step toward that vision is materializing in Motiv's climate-controlled clean room: a sleek robotic arm whose angles resemble those of a praying mantis.This is the Cold Operable Lunar Deployable Arm, a robotic arm capable of operating in the cold of the lunar poles. Motiv is building it using parts supplied by JPL in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge. If COLDArm passes all testing here on Earth, the next goal for the project is to secure a place on NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services, a program that allows U.S. companies to send technology to the moon's surface for testing or to conduct scientific experiments.      The 6.5-foot (2-meter) arm is only one piece of a future lunar rover, but it's a crucial one. The arm is the primary tool for scooping up samples from the moon's surface. If it fails, so does the mission.Motiv previously built the robotic arm on Perseverance, the rover currently exploring Mars' Jezero crater . The 7-foot-long arm holds such crucial instruments as SHERLOC, which searches for evidence of past microbial life, and the X-ray spectrometer known as PIXL.If COLDArm proves successful, it could supercharge the amount of experimentation that can be conducted in the chillier regions of our solar system.JPL has experience building machines that can function in Martian temperatures as cold as minus 202 F (minus 130 Celsius), said Ryan McCormick, the principal investigator for COLDArm.\"But getting even colder,\" he said, \"is a big challenge.\"Many lubricants and adhesives that function on Mars will degrade in the cold of a lunar night. Certain electronics that worked fine for the Mars rovers\u2014which can take advantage of the heat trapped by the thin Martian atmosphere\u2014won't work on the moon either.COLDArm is made of bulk metallic glass, a class of metals whose atomic arrangements more closely resembles that of glass, making them stronger and more durable than steel or ceramic.Bulk metallic glass doesn't require a wet lubricant at its joints. That's crucial, because wet lubricants freeze solid at minus 94 F (minus 70 C)\u2014a practically tropical temperature compared with the chill of the lunar poles. Previous rover arms have had to be built with tiny heaters at each joint to keep the lubricant at a pliable temperature. Bulk metallic glass makes that unnecessary, Fradet said.In addition, COLDArm's motor controllers have been fitted with an updated voltage converter that can function in extremely cold environments without the added bulk of cables or insulation, McCormick said.In March, the Motiv team disassembled the arm and tested its various components in a thermal vacuum set below 100 Kelvin, or roughly minus 175 C. (Extreme cold has its own temperature units, with zero Kelvin representing the point at which molecules stop moving.)All of the parts functioned in both the extreme cold and in vibration testing designed to simulate launch conditions, McCormick said. The next step is to reassemble the arm and ensure that it works as a whole in those conditions.Adding to the complexity is the fact that temperature functions in a completely different way on the moon than it does on Earth, said JPL planetary scientist Laura Kerber. The moon has no air to redistribute heat, so when light hits the moon's surface, it gets super hot\u2014up to 250 F at the equator. Without that light, it's super cold.Given the moon's position relative to the sun, the interiors of craters at its south pole remain in constant shadow. That makes them about as cold and dark as anything in the solar system.\"In those permanently shadowed regions, all they see is the cold of space,\" Kerber said. \"Engineering-wise, it's so hard to make something that can survive inside those really, really cold, permanently shadowed craters.\"That's a major issue for NASA's Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, better known as VIPER, which is scheduled to land at the moon's south pole in late 2024 to search for water ice.The strongest hints of water on the moon are in the deepest-shadowed areas. Those places are too cold for VIPER, but it will skirt around them and collect samples from the surrounding area, where the suggestions of water are weaker but still significant.Navigating the moon's temperature extremes has been a challenge since the earliest lunar missions. That's a big part of the reason Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin flew 240,000 miles for a relatively short wander around their spacecraft: It was simply too hot at Apollo 11's landing site in the Sea of Tranquility to go any farther.\"We were operating in a near-perfect vacuum, with the temperature well above 200 degrees Fahrenheit,\" Neil Armstrong told NPR in 2010. \"NASA officials limited our surface working time to 2 3/4 hours on that first surface exploration to assure that we would not expire of hyperthermia.\"    2023 Los Angeles Times.

  "text": "Shining like a brilliant beacon amidst a sea of galaxies, Arp 220 lights up the night sky in this view from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. Actually two spiral galaxies in the process of merging, Arp 220 glows brightest in infrared light, making it an ideal target for Webb. It is an ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) with a luminosity of more than a trillion suns. In comparison, our Milky Way galaxy has a much more modest luminosity of about ten billion suns.       Located 250 million light-years away in the constellation of Serpens, the Serpent, Arp 220 is the 220th object in Halton Arp's Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. It is the nearest ULIRG and the brightest of the three galactic mergers closest to Earth.The collision of the two spiral galaxies began about 700 million years ago. It sparked an enormous burst of star formation. About 200 huge star clusters reside in a packed, dusty region about 5,000 light-years across (about 5 percent of the Milky Way's diameter). The amount of gas in this tiny region is equal to all of the gas in the entire Milky Way galaxy.Previous radio telescope observations revealed about 100 supernova remnants in an area of less than 500 light-years. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope uncovered the cores of the parent galaxies 1,200 light-years apart. Each of the cores has a rotating, star-forming ring blasting out the dazzling infrared light so apparent in this Webb view. This glaring light creates diffraction spikes\u2014the starburst feature that dominates this image.

Note that the relationship between north and east on the sky (as seen from below) is flipped relative to direction arrows on a map of the ground (as seen from above). The scale bar is labeled in light-years, which is the distance that light travels in one Earth-year. (It takes 18,000 years for light to travel a distance equal to the length of the bar.) One light-year is equal to about 5.88 trillion miles or 9.46 trillion kilometers.

  "text": "The coastal town of Exmouth in Western Australia is due to experience one of the most spectacular astronomical phenomena on April 20 2023\u2014a total solar eclipse.          Eclipses have entranced us for millennia. But it turns out calculating exactly when and where we can watch an eclipse in its full glory can be surprisingly hard.Watching the sun and the moonBeing so dominant in the sky, the sun and the moon were the most captivating celestial bodies for ancient cultures to observe. Naturally, they also tried to anticipate and predict their motions.While the sun's movement is quite simple, the moon moves across the sky with much more complexity. For one thing, it has phases; it also grows and shrinks in apparent size as it travels on an elliptical orbit around Earth.On top of this, the moon appears to rock and wobble quite haphazardly on its journey across the sky, making it extremely challenging to accurately describe its orbit. In fact, explaining the moon's motion was the only problem that made Isaac Newton's head hurt.Since eclipses are so startling to witness, many ancient peoples both noted their occurrence in writing and art, and discovered the repeating characteristics of such events.During a lunar eclipse, where Earth blocks sunlight that would otherwise illuminate a full moon, the dimmed moon takes on a bloody hue. Many cultures attached foreboding to such events (like the partial lunar eclipse seen during the Fall of Constantinople in 1453) and quite reasonably wondered when the next such event might occur.                The Saros period (marked with a red rectangle) is visible on a fragment of the \u2018user manual\u2019 of the Antikythera mechanism. Credit: Xmoussas/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA The not-so-mythical Saros cycleVarious cultures around the world have independently discovered eclipses seem to occur on an 18-year cycle. It was mentioned in written records by the Babylonians and Assyrians (of ancient Mesopotamia and modern Iraq), and oral tradition suggests the cycle was used for ceremonial purposes by Torres Strait Islanders in what is now Australia.This 18-year cycle, which can persist as a sequence for over a thousand years, is now known as a Saros cycle. The word \"Saros\" was referenced in the 10th-century Byzantine Suda encyclopedia, and possibly has a Greek origin (\"saro\" meaning \"sweep\", perhaps relating to how eclipses sweep across the sky).The Saros cycle represents how long it takes for the sun-Earth-moon system to return to almost exactly the same triangular configuration. So, if you see a lunar eclipse, you can expect another one 18 years later, visible from most places on Earth.If you were an ancient culture that happened to observe a total solar eclipse, you would have been very lucky indeed (they occur roughly every 375 years at a given region on Earth). But would you have seen a similar event 18 years later? Alas, no. While there probably was another total solar eclipse 18 years later, it would have been over a completely different part of the planet.After 54 years\u2014three Saros cycles\u2014the eclipse region should have returned to roughly the same position on Earth. But only very roughly, as it could be thousands of kilometers away from the previous observation spot.Worldwide, there is a total solar eclipse visible somewhere roughly every 18 months during one of two possible \"eclipse seasons\" per year. This is much more frequent than an 18-year Saros cycle, and is possible because multiple repeating Saros sequences overlap at once (roughly a dozen), each offset by at least six months. For example, the 2028 total solar eclipse that will be visible in Sydney is part of an entirely different Saros sequence than this year's eclipse.After about a thousand years, when one long-term Saros sequence ends, another will begin with slightly different timing.                The path of the eclipse as described by Halley in 1715. Credit: University of Cambridge, Institute of Astronomy Library From antiquity to modern daySo could our ancient ancestors actually predict eclipses? Yes, if we are talking about lunar eclipses, and perhaps even partial solar eclipses.A famous predictive example is the Eclipse of Thales in 585 BCE, although the fact that a total solar eclipse happened over Greece was almost certainly more luck than science. That is, they wouldn't have predicted that 18 years later (567 BCE) a total solar eclipse was visible in what is now the United States.It is likely the famed Greek Antikythera Mechanism, an astoundingly complicated 2,000-year-old mechanical device that was used to predict the night sky, could calculate the 18-year Saros accurately. But significantly, it could not predict total solar eclipses at a precise place on Earth\u2014just their timing.In summary, it is clear ancient people could predict timings for lunar eclipses and partial solar eclipses, but there is no convincing evidence of people predicting the times and locations of total solar eclipses.Entering the modern era of science, the first true prediction of a total solar eclipse (both in time and location) occurred in 1715. Edmond Halley (of comet fame) correctly predicted, to within four minutes and 20 miles, a total solar eclipse that rather conveniently passed over his own house in London. He did this by making full use of Isaac Newton's new theories of gravity and orbital mechanics: the Principia.Today, we don't rely on calculating the orbits of the whole solar system to predict eclipses. For example, NASA uses a highly advanced form of an ancient technique\u2014pattern recognition. Using some 38,000 repeating mathematical terms, NASA can predict both solar and lunar eclipses for 1,000 years into the future. Beyond that, the moon's wobble and Earth's changing rotation make eclipse prediction less accurate.So for those of you lucky enough to witness a total solar eclipse this month, take a moment to think about what this shared experience has meant to humans around the world for thousands of years.Trying to predict and explain this phenomenon has directly driven advancements in mathematics and orbital mechanics, and with its beauty we have been forced to embrace the limits of our scientific knowledge.

  "question_squad": " What is the dominant form of matter in the universe?",
  "answer_squad": " Dark matter",
  "text": "Testing the possibility of models of gravity different from general relativity may be closer to home than we think. In a paper published on the arXiv preprint server, a team of researchers has proposed that we might be able to use seismic motions in the Earth itself to test for modified gravity.          We do not understand 95% of the contents of the universe. Collectively known as the dark sector, the unknowns include both dark matter and dark energy. Dark matter appears to be the dominant form of matter in the universe, with each galaxy containing up to 80% of this invisible form of matter. Meanwhile, dark energy is some source of energy that suffuses all of space-time and is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the cosmos.But the statements that dark matter and dark energy are physical entities rests on the assumption that our understanding of gravity is correct. Currently, our best understanding of gravity comes from Einstein's general theory of relativity. This theory tells us that gravity is the manifestation of the bending and warping of space-time itself.But we know the general relativity is incomplete. We know that it breaks down in the centers of black holes and at the beginning of the universe. So we know we do not yet have the full story of gravity in our hands. Motivated by this, many people over the decades have proposed theories of modified gravity, which constitute a set of extensions and refinements to Einstein's original model.However, all these extensions face a series of difficult hurdles. We have tested general relativity in many contexts and in many scales, so it is difficult to construct a theory that is significantly different enough from vanilla general relativity to potentially explain away dark matter and dark energy, and yet satisfies all known observational constraints.The more ways we can develop to probe modified gravity the better. And so a team of researchers have found that we don't necessarily need to look to the stars to test various modified theories of gravity. We can instead look down into the Earth. They discovered that under modified gravity, seismic waves travel through the Earth at different rates and in different ways.Since we know so many properties of the Earth so well, like its mass and its moment of inertia, we can turn this knowledge around to use seismic data to constrain modified gravity theories.So far the data do not suggest any need for a deviation from Einstein's original work. But the more tools we develop, and the more ways we can search, the better. More information:Aleksander Kozak et al, Planetary seismology as a test of modified gravity proposals, arXiv (2023).

  "question_squad": " What was the mission of the ICESat-2 satellite?",
  "answer_squad": " to use laser light to measure the height of Earth's ice, water, and land surfaces",
  "text": "The green light streaking across the cloudy sky was something that Daichi Fujii had never seen before. The museum curator's motion-detecting cameras were set up near Japan's Mount Fuji to capture meteors, allowing him to calculate their position, brightness, and orbit. But the bright green lines that appeared on a video taken Sept. 16, 2022, were a mystery.          Then Fujii looked closer. The beams were synchronized with a tiny green dot that was briefly visible between the clouds. He guessed it was a satellite, so he investigated orbital data and got a match. NASA's Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite 2, or ICESat-2, had flown overhead that night. Fujii posted his findings on social media, which eventually got the attention of the NASA team.It's the first time the ICESat-2 team has seen footage of the satellite's green laser beams streaming from orbit to Earth, said Tony Martino, ICESat-2 instrument scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\"ICESat-2 appeared to be almost directly overhead of him, with the beam hitting the low clouds at an angle,\" Martino said. \"To see the laser, you have to be in the exact right place, at the right time, and you have to have the right conditions.\"ICESat-2 was launched in September 2018 with a mission to use laser light to measure the height of Earth's ice, water, and land surfaces from space. The laser instrument, called a lidar, fires 10,000 times a second, sending six beams of light to Earth. It precisely times how long it takes individual photons to bounce off the surface and return to the satellite. Computer programs use these measurements to calculate ice losses from Greenland and Antarctica, observe how much of the polar oceans are frozen, determine the heights of freshwater reservoirs, map shallow coastal regions, and more.On Sept. 16, 2022, motion-sensing cameras set up by museum curator Daichi Fujii to capture meteors instead caught the laser beams of NASA's ICESat-2 satellite as it passed over Japan. It's the first time the ICESat-2 team has seen footage of the lasers at work in orbit. Credit: Daichi Fujii, Hiratsuka City MuseumFired from hundreds of miles up in space, the laser light is not harmful. In fact, it's tricky to spot. If someone stood directly under the satellite and looked up, the laser would have the strength of a camera flash more than 100 yards away, Martino said.People have tried to photograph the satellite when it passed over, and in a couple instances they were able to capture photos\u2014once from southern Chile and once from Oklahoma.The beam is even more difficult to capture, he noted, since cameras and eyes need the laser light to reflect off something to see the beam from the side. That's where the atmospheric conditions come in.On the night ICESat-2 passed over Fuji City, however, there were enough clouds to scatter the laser light\u2014making it visible to the cameras\u2014but not so many clouds that they blocked the light altogether. There were actually two thin layers of clouds over Japan that night\u2014information Martino found by analyzing the ICESat-2 data, which shows clouds as well as the ground below.                As its picture was being taken from the ground, ICESat-2 was at work collecting data on the height profile of the clouds, mountainous terrain and ocean of Japan below. This ICESat-2 data plot shows what the satellite measured as it passed over Fuji City, Japan (marked with a vertical green line) on Sept. 16, 2022. The laser instrument detected two cloud layers, one high and one low, which scattered the light enough to be detected by the cameras on the ground. Credit: NASA/Tony Martino             With the precise location of the satellite in space, the location of where the beam hit, the coordinates of where Fujii's cameras were set up, and the addition of cloudy conditions, Martino was able to confirm, definitively, that the streaks of light came from ICESat-2's laser.

  "text": "ESA's Solar Orbiter may have taken another step towards solving the eighty-year-old mystery of why the sun's outer atmosphere is so hot.          On March 3, 2022, just a few months into Solar Orbiter's nominal mission, the spacecraft's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) returned data showing for the first time that a magnetic phenomenon called reconnection was taking place persistently on tiny scales.At that time, the spacecraft was about halfway between the Earth and the sun. This enabled coordinated observations with NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) missions. The data from the three missions was then combined during the analysis.Magnetic reconnection occurs when a magnetic field changes itself into a more stable configuration. It is a fundamental energy release mechanism in superheated gasses known as plasmas and is believed to be the major mechanism for powering large-scale solar eruptions. This makes it the direct cause of space weather, and a prime candidate for the mysterious heating of the sun's outer atmosphere.It has been known since the 1940s that the sun's outer atmosphere, called the corona, is much hotter than the sun's surface. While the surface glows at around 5,500\u00b0C, the corona is a rarified gas of around 2 million \u00b0C. How the sun injects energy into its atmosphere to heat it to this tremendous temperature has been a major puzzle ever since.In the past, magnetic reconnection has usually been seen during large-scale, explosive phenomena. However, the new result presents ultra-high-resolution observations of persistent small-scale (around 390 km across) reconnection in the corona. These are revealed to be a long-lived 'gentle' sequence compared to sudden explosive releases of energy that reconnection is usually associated with.Credit: ESA & NASA/Solar Orbiter/EUI Team; acknowledgement: Cheng et alThe March 3, 2022 event took place over the period of one hour. The temperatures around the point of the magnetic field where the magnetic field intensity drops to zero, known as the null-point, sustained itself at around 10 million \u00b0C, and generated an outflow of material that came in the form of discrete \"blobs\" traveling away from the null point with a speed of around 80 km/s.      In addition to this continuous outflow, an explosive episode also took place around this null point, and lasted for four minutes.Solar Orbiter's results suggest that magnetic reconnection, at scales that were previously too small to be resolved, proceeds continually in both gentle and explosive ways. This is importantly because it means that reconnection can therefore persistently transfer mass and energy to the overlying corona, contributing to heating it. These results are published in Nature Communications in a paper titled \"Ultra-high-resolution Observations of Persistent Null-point Reconnection in the Solar Corona.\"These observations also suggest that even smaller and more frequent magnetic reconnections await discovery. The goal is now to observe these with EUI at even higher spatio-temporal resolution in the future around Solar Orbiter's closest approaches to estimate what fraction of the corona's heat may be transferred in this way.Solar Orbiter's most recent closest passage to the sun took place on 10 April 2023. At that time, the spacecraft was just 29% the Earth's distance from the sun.Solar Orbiter is a space mission of international collaboration between ESA and NASA, operated by ESA. More information:X.

  "text": "Elon Musk's SpaceX is about to take its most daring leap yet with a round-the-world test flight of its mammoth Starship.          It's the biggest and mightiest rocket ever built, with the lofty goals of ferrying people to the moon and Mars.Jutting almost 400 feet (120 meters) into the South Texas sky, Starship could blast off as early as Monday, with no one aboard. Musk's company got the OK from the Federal Aviation Administration on Friday.It will be the first launch with Starship's two sections together. Early versions of the sci-fi-looking upper stage rocketed several miles into the stratosphere a few years back, crashing four times before finally landing upright in 2021. The towering first-stage rocket booster, dubbed Super Heavy, will soar for the first time.For this demo, SpaceX won't attempt any landings of the rocket or the spacecraft. Everything will fall into the sea.\"I'm not saying it will get to orbit, but I am guaranteeing excitement. It won't be boring,\" Musk promised at a Morgan Stanley conference last month. \"I think it's got, I don't know, hopefully about a 50% chance of reaching orbit.\"Here's the rundown on Starship's debut:SUPERSIZE ROCKETThe stainless steel Starship has 33 main engines and 16.7 million pounds of thrust. All but two of the methane-fueled, first-stage engines ignited during a launch pad test in January\u2014good enough to reach orbit, Musk noted. Given its muscle, Starship could lift as much as 250 tons and accommodate 100 people on a trip to Mars. The six-engine spacecraft accounts for 164 feet (50 meters) of its height. Musk anticipates using Starship to launch satellites into low-Earth orbit, including his own Starlinks for internet service, before strapping anyone in. Starship easily eclipses NASA's moon rockets\u2014the Saturn V from the bygone Apollo era and the Space Launch System from the Artemis program that logged its first lunar trip late last year. It also outflanks the former Soviet Union's N1 moon rocket, which never made it past a minute into flight, exploding with no one aboard.                This photo provided by SpaceX shows the company's Starship rocket at the launch site in Boca Chica, Texas, on Wednesday, April 12, 2023. Credit: SpaceX via AP             GAME PLANThe test flight will last 1 1/2 hours, and fall short of a full orbit of Earth. If Starship reaches the three-minute mark after launch, the booster will be commanded to separate and fall into the Gulf of Mexico. The spacecraft would continue eastward, passing over the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans before ditching near Hawaii. Starship is designed to be fully reusable but nothing will be saved from the test flight. Harvard astrophysicist and spacecraft tracker Jonathan McDowell will be more excited whenever Starship actually lands and returns intact from orbit. It will be \"a profound development in spaceflight if and when Starship is debugged and operational,\" he said.LAUNCH PADStarship will take off from a remote site on the southernmost tip of Texas near Boca Chica Beach. It's just below South Padre Island, and about 20 miles from Brownsville. Down the road from the launch pad is the complex where SpaceX has been developing and building Starship prototypes for the past several years. The complex, called Starbase, has more than 1,800 employees, who live in Brownsville or elsewhere in the Rio Grande Valley. The Texas launch pad is equipped with giant robotic arms\u2014called chopsticks\u2014to eventually grab a returning booster as it lands. SpaceX is retooling one of its two Florida launch pads to accommodate Starships down the road. Florida is where SpaceX's Falcon rockets blast off with crew, space station cargo and satellites for NASA and other customers.THE ODDSAs usual, Musk is remarkably blunt about his chances, giving even odds, at best, that Starship will reach orbit on its first flight. But with a fleet of Starships under construction at Starbase, he estimates an 80% chance that one of them will attain orbit by year's end. He expects it will take a couple years to achieve full and rapid reusability.CUSTOMERSWith Starship, the California-based SpaceX is focusing on the moon for now, with a $3 billion NASA contract to land astronauts on the lunar surface as early as 2025, using the upper stage spacecraft. It will be the first moon landing by astronauts in more than 50 years. The moonwalkers will leave Earth via NASA's Orion capsule and Space Launch System rocket, and then transfer to Starship in lunar orbit for the descent to the surface, and then back to Orion. To reach the moon and beyond, Starship will first need to refuel in low-Earth orbit. SpaceX envisions an orbiting depot with window-less Starships as tankers. But Starship isn't just for NASA. A private crew will be the first to fly Starship, orbiting Earth. Two private flights to the moon would follow\u2014no landings, just flyarounds.OTHER PLAYERSThere are other new rockets on the horizon. Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is readying the New Glenn rocket for its orbital debut from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in the next year or so. Named after the first American to orbit the world, John Glenn, the rocket towers over the company's current New Shepard rocket, named for Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard's 1961 suborbital hop. NASA will use New Glenn to send a pair of spacecraft to Mars in 2024. United Launch Alliance expects its new Vulcan rocket to make its inaugural launch later this year, hoisting a private lunar lander to the moon at NASA's behest. Europe's Arianespace is close to launching its new, upgraded Ariane 6 rocket from French Guiana in South America. And NASA's Space Launch System moon rocket that will carry astronauts will morph into ever bigger versions.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

  "text": "A new NASA study offers an explanation of how quakes could be the source of the mysteriously smooth terrain on moons circling Jupiter and Saturn.          Many of the ice-encrusted moons orbiting the giant planets in the far reaches of our solar system are known to be geologically active. Jupiter and Saturn have such strong gravity that they stretch and pull the bodies orbiting them, causing moonquakes that can crack the moons' crusts and surfaces. New research shows for the first time how these quakes may trigger landslides that lead to remarkably smooth terrain.The study, published in Icarus, outlines the link between quakes and landslides, shedding new light on how icy moon surfaces and textures evolve.On the surfaces of icy moons such as Europa, Ganymede, and Enceladus, it's common to see steep ridges surrounded by relatively flat, smooth areas. Scientists have theorized that these spots result from liquid that flows out of icy volcanoes. But how that process works when the surface temperatures are so cold and inhospitable to fluids has remained a mystery.A simple explanation outlined in the study doesn't involve liquid on the surface. Scientists measured the dimensions of the steep ridges, which are believed to be tectonic fault scarps (like those on Earth)\u2014steep slopes caused when the surface breaks along a fault line and one side drops. By applying the measurements to seismic models, they estimated the power of past moonquakes and found they could be strong enough to lift debris that then falls downhill, where it spreads out, smoothing the landscape.\"We found the surface shaking from moonquakes would be enough to cause surface material to rush downhill in landslides. We've estimated the size of moonquakes and how big the landslides could be,\" said lead author Mackenzie Mills, a graduate student at the University of Arizona in Tucson, who conducted the work during a series of summer internships at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"This helps us understand how landslides might be shaping moon surfaces over time.\"                Close-up views of observed scarps on each satellite: (a1, a2) Ganymede, (b1) Europa, (c1) Enceladus, (d1) Dione.

DOI: 10.1016/j.icarus.2023.115534             Upcoming investigationsNASA's upcoming Europa Clipper mission, bound for Jupiter's moon Europa in 2024, will give the research a significant boost, providing imagery and other science data. After reaching Jupiter in 2030, the spacecraft will orbit the gas giant and conduct about 50 flybys of Europa. The mission has a sophisticated payload of nine science instruments to determine if Europa, which scientists believe contains a deep internal ocean beneath an outer ice shell, has conditions that could be suitable for life.\"It was surprising to find out more about how powerful moonquakes could be and that it could be simple for them to move debris downslope,\" said co-author Robert Pappalardo, project scientist of Europa Clipper at JPL, which manages the mission.Especially surprising were the modeling results for tectonic activity and quakes on Saturn's moon Enceladus, a body that has less than 3% of the surface area of Europa and about 1/650 that of Earth. \"Because of that moon's small gravity, quakes on tiny Enceladus could be large enough to fling icy debris right off the surface and into space like a wet dog shaking itself off,\" Pappalardo said.When it comes to Europa, the high-resolution images gathered by Europa Clipper will help scientists determine the power of past moonquakes. Researchers will be able to apply the recent findings to understand whether quakes have moved ice and other surface materials and by how much. Images from the ESA (European Space Agency) Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission will offer similar information about Europa's neighboring Jovian moon, Ganymede.\"We hope to gain a better understanding of the geological processes that have shaped icy moons over time and to what extent their surfaces may still be active today,\" Pappalardo said.

Today, the European Space Agency (ESA) is launching the Juice\u2014Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer\u2014mission to explore the gas giant and its icy moons.Before setting off to meet the king of the gods and some of his many satellites (all named after his lovers), the Juice spacecraft had to be tested against the effects of the radiation environment induced by the magnetic fields surrounding the planet. Jupiter has a very strong magnetic field, which traps protons and electrons of energies up to several hundred megaelectronvolts with very large fluxes.The direct and indirect impact of high-energy electrons on modern electronic devices, and in particular their ability to cause SEE (single event effects), had never been studied before.CERN has the only facility on Earth that is able to replicate the most extreme phenomena of Jupiter's harsh radiative environment. In 2018, in order to prepare the spacecraft for its exploration mission, ESA came to VESPER (the very energetic electron facility for space planetary exploration missions). There, engineers and physicists successfully tested the capacity of some of Juice's critical electronic components to withstand high-energy electron fluxes for several years of operation.\"The tests performed at CERN reinforce ESA's planetary exploration ambitions and helped optimize the Juice spacecraft design,\" says Giuseppe Sarri, ESA Juice project manager.\"VESPER is part of CLEAR (the CERN Linear Electron Accelerator for Research). We are happy to have helped better understand, anticipate and mitigate the impact of Jupiter's radiation. Godspeed Juice!\" says Roberto Corsini, CLEAR facility leader.

  "text": "Primordial holes formed in the exotic conditions of the big bang may have become their own source of matter and radiation.          The standard story of the early universe goes like this. When our cosmos was incredibly young, it underwent a period of incredibly rapid expansion known as inflation. Then inflation went away and flooded the universe with particles and radiation in the hot big bang. Then the universe expanded and cooled, and as it did so the density of that matter and radiation dropped. Eventually the matter got itself together informed stars, galaxies and clusters.But new research, now published on the arXiv preprint server, suggests that this simple story may be missing a key ingredient: primordial black holes. Currently we know of only one guaranteed way to create black holes. That's through the deaths of massive stars. When they collapse in on themselves at the end of their lives, they reach high enough densities to overwhelm every other force and trigger the formation of a black hole.But the early universe may have been exotic enough to make black holes in its own way. When inflation ended and the universe began to cool off, it was not a smooth and gentle process. Instead it was incredibly violent, with massive shifts in energy and mass from place to place. It's possible that pockets of the universe may have spontaneously reached high enough densities to form black holes directly on their own, without having to go through the formation of stars first. These are the so-called primordial black holes.Cosmological observations already placed severe limits on the number of primordial black holes that could inhabit the early universe. But there is still room for them to exist. And a team of researchers have put together a paper exploring an unexpected consequence of the formation of these primordial black holes.We know from the work of Stephen Hawking that black holes are not entirely black. They actually glow a little bit through an exotic quantum process known as Hawking radiation. For normal-sized black holes this is a very inefficient process. A typical black hole will only emit one particle of radiation every year or so. But smaller black holes emit much more radiation.If the primordial black holes were small enough, then they would evaporate completely while the universe was still in its infant stages, leaving no trace of their existence behind. But the researchers found that this leads to a curious situation. As these primordial black holes evaporated they released their own floods of radiation and matter.Despite the expansion of the universe, if enough primordial black holes evaporated then the density of matter and radiation could stay constant. This would lead to a an extended black hole-based big bang scenario.Eventually all the primordial black holes would go away and the rest of cosmological history would go on without them. But they would leave their mark. The changes in matter and radiation density can potentially have long-lasting impacts that we could detect even to the present day. And the evaporation of primordial black holes themselves trigger the formation of gravitational waves, which might linger still today.We may not ever find direct evidence for primordial black holes, but the researchers have found that we may find their subtle fingerprints throughout the universe.

  "text": "The history-making rotorcraft has recently been negotiating some of the most hazardous terrain it's encountered on the Red Planet.          NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter has completed its 50th flight on Mars. The first aircraft on another world reached the half-century mark on April 13, traveling over 1,057.09 feet (322.2 meters) in 145.7 seconds. The helicopter also achieved a new altitude record of 59 feet (18 meters) before alighting near the half-mile-wide (800-meter-wide) \"Belva Crater.\"With Flight 50 in the mission logbook, the helicopter team plans to perform another repositioning flight before exploring the \"Fall River Pass\" region of Jezero Crater.\"Just as the Wright brothers continued their experiments well after that momentous day at Kitty Hawk in 1903, the Ingenuity team continues to pursue and learn from the flight operations of the first aircraft on another world,\" said Lori Glaze, director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington.Ingenuity landed on the Red Planet in February 2021 attached to the belly of NASA's Mars Perseverance rover and will soon mark the two-year anniversary of its first flight, which took place on April 19, 2021. Designed as a technology demonstration that would fly no more than five times, the helicopter was intended to prove powered, controlled flight on another planet was possible. But Ingenuity exceeded expectations and transitioned into being an operations demonstration.NASA\u2019s Ingenuity Mars helicopter made history when it achieved the first powered, controlled flight on another planet on April 19, 2021. A little less than two years later, on April 13, 2023, it completed its 50th flight. Here are some highlights from the rotorcraft\u2019s journeys on the Red Planet. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU/MSSSEvery time Ingenuity goes airborne, it covers new ground and offers a perspective no previous planetary mission could achieve. Imagery from the helicopter has not only demonstrated how aircraft could serve as forward scouts for future planetary expeditions, but it has even come in handy for the Perseverance team.By testing the helicopter's limits, engineers are gathering flight data that can be used by engineers working on designs for possible future Mars helicopters. That includes the people designing the Mars Sample Return campaign's proposed Sample Recovery Helicopters.Riskier terrainSince leaving the relatively flat confines of Jezero Crater's floor on Jan. 19, Ingenuity has flown 11 times, setting new speed and altitude records of 14.5 mph (6.5 meters per second) and 59 feet (18 meters) along the way.Although the deep chill of winter and regional dust events (which can block the Sun's rays from reaching the helicopter's solar panel) have abated, Ingenuity continues to brown out at night. As a result, the Helicopter Base Station on the rover needs to search for the rotorcraft's signal each morning at the time Ingenuity is predicted to wake up. And when the helicopter does fly, it now must navigate rugged and relatively uncharted terrain, landing in spots that can be surrounded by hazards.\"We are not in Martian Kansas anymore,\" said Josh Anderson, Ingenuity operations lead at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"We're flying over the dried-up remnants of an ancient river that is filled with sand dunes, boulders, and rocks, and surrounded by hills that could have us for lunch. And while we recently upgraded the navigation software onboard to help determine safe airfields, every flight is still a white-knuckler.\"Teddy Tzanetos at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory provides an update on the agency\u2019s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter and discusses how it\u2019s inspiring future aerial exploration of the red planet. Credit: NASA/JPL-CaltechFrequent flyerBeyond facing more challenging terrain, Ingenuity will also fly at a greater frequency in the coming days because the helicopter needs to remain within electronic earshot of the rover. With its AutoNav capability, Perseverance can travel hundreds of meters each day.\"Ingenuity relies on Perseverance to act as a communications relay between it and mission controllers here at JPL,\" said Anderson. \"If the rover gets too far ahead or disappears behind a hill, we could lose communications. The rover team has a job to do and a schedule to keep. So it's imperative Ingenuity keeps up and is in the lead whenever possible.\"Perseverance recently completed exploring \"Foel Drygarn,\" a scientific target that may contain hydrated silica (which is of strong astrobiological interest). It is currently headed to \"Mount Julian,\" which will provide a panoramic view into nearby Belva Crater.NASA\u2019s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter is seen here at the starting point of its 47th flight on Mars.

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU/MSSSFeats of IngenuityBuilt with many off-the-shelf components, such as smartphone processors and cameras, Ingenuity is now 23 Earth months and 45 flights beyond its expected lifetime. The rotorcraft has flown for over 89 minutes and more than 7.1 miles (11.6 kilometers).\"When we first flew, we thought we would be incredibly lucky to eke out five flights,\" said Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity team lead at JPL. \"We have exceeded our expected cumulative flight time since our technology demonstration wrapped by 1,250% and expected distance flown by 2,214%.\"Surpassing expectations like this comes at a cost, however. With some helicopter components showing signs of wear and the terrain becoming more challenging, the Ingenuity team recognizes that every great mission must eventually come to an end. \"We have come so far, and we want to go farther,\" said Tzanetos. \"But we have known since the very beginning our time at Mars was limited, and every operational day is a blessing. Whether Ingenuity's mission ends tomorrow, next week, or months from now is something no one can predict at present. What I can predict is that when it does, we'll have one heck of a party.\" Provided byJet Propulsion LaboratoryCitation:NASA's Ingenuity Mars helicopter completes 50th flight (2023, April 14)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-nasa-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-50th.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "This image taken with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope shows JO204, a 'jellyfish galaxy' so named for the bright tendrils of gas that appear in this image as drifting lazily below JO204's bright central bulk.       The galaxy lies almost 600 million light-years away in the constellation Sextans. Hubble observed JO204 as part of a survey performed with the intention of better understanding star formation under extreme conditions.While the delicate ribbons of gas beneath JO204 may look like floating jellyfish tentacles, they are in fact the outcome of an intense astronomical process known as ram pressure stripping. Ram pressure is a particular type of pressure exerted on a body when it moves relative to a fluid. An intuitive example is the sensation of pressure you experience when you are standing in an intense gust of wind\u2014the wind is a moving fluid, and your body feels pressure from it.An extension of this analogy is that your body will remain whole and coherent, but the more loosely bound things\u2014like your hair and your clothes\u2014will flap in the wind. The same is true for jellyfish galaxies. They experience ram pressure because of their movement against the intergalactic medium that fills the spaces between galaxies in a galaxy cluster. The galaxies experience intense pressure from that movement, and as a result their more loosely bound gas is stripped away.This gas is mostly the colder and denser gas in the galaxy\u2014gas which, when stirred and compressed by the ram pressure, collapses and forms new stars in the jellyfish's beautiful tendrils.

But despite the great distance and the comparatively small sizes of these asteroids, Lucy caught views of four of them recently.       From March 25 to 27, 2023, Lucy used its highest resolution imager, L'LORRI, to capture its first views of four Jupiter Trojan asteroids. From left to right in the above image: Eurybates, Polymele, Leucus, and Orus.Although the four images are all at the same scale, the orientation of each is different, reflecting the different orientations of the L'LORRI camera as it turned to capture each target.The targets were also observed for different time periods based on their rotation periods:Eurybates images were taken over a span of 6.5 hours.Polymele, about 2.5 hours.Leucus, 2 hours.Orus, 10 hours.These images are the first in a series of planned observations designed to measure how the Trojan asteroids reflect light at higher angles than is observable from Earth. Though the asteroids are still just single points of light in these images, seen against a background of distant stars, the data will help the team choose exposure times for Lucy's close-up observations of its targets.Lucy will fly by these asteroids in 2027 and 2028 as the spacecraft travels through a swarm of small asteroids that lead Jupiter in its orbit around the sun.

The journey began with a perfect morning liftoff by Europe's Ariane rocket from French Guiana on the coast of South America. But there were some tense minutes later as controllers awaited signals from the spacecraft.When contact finally was confirmed close to an hour into the flight, Mission Control in Germany declared: \"The spacecraft is alive!\"It will take the robotic explorer, dubbed Juice, eight years to reach Jupiter, where it will scope out not only the solar system's biggest planet but also Europa, Callisto and Ganymede. The three ice-encrusted moons are believed to harbor underground oceans, where sea life could exist.Then in perhaps the most impressive feat of all, Juice will attempt to go into orbit around Ganymede: No spacecraft has ever orbited a moon other than our own.With so many moons\u2014at last count 95\u2014astronomers consider Jupiter a mini solar system of its own, with missions like Juice long overdue.\"This is a mission that is answering questions of science that are burning to all of us,\" said European Space Agency's director general, Josef Aschbacher after the launch. \"Of course, one of these questions is: Is there life out there?\"                This photo provided by the European Space Agency shows an Ariane 5 rocket carrying the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, Juice, spacecraft lifting off from Europe's Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, Friday, April 14, 2023.

Then it will hit the brakes to orbit Ganymede, the primary target of the 1.6 billion-euro mission (nearly $1.8 billion).Ganymede is not only the solar system's largest moon\u2014it surpasses Mercury\u2014but has its own magnetic field with dazzling auroras at the poles.Even more enticing, it's thought to have an underground ocean holding more water than Earth.

Juice will keep its Europa encounters to a minimum, however, because of the intense radiation there so close to Jupiter.Juice's sensitive electronics are encased in lead to protect against radiation. The 14,000-pound (6,350-kilogram) spacecraft also is wrapped with thermal blankets\u2014temperatures near Jupiter hover around minus 380 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 230 degrees Celsius). And its solar panels stretch 88 feet (27 meters) tip to tip to soak in as much sunlight that far from the sun.Late next year, NASA will send an even more heavily shielded spacecraft to Jupiter, the long-awaited Europa Clipper, which will beat Juice to Jupiter by more than a year because it will launch on SpaceX's mightier rocket.

  "text": "Using NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), a team of astronomers from Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and elsewhere has detected a new exoplanet. The newfound alien world, designated LHS 475 b, is about the size of Venus and orbits a nearby M-dwarf star. The discovery was reported April 4 on the arXiv pre-print repository.          TESS is conducting a survey of about 200,000 of the brightest stars near the sun with the aim of searching for transiting exoplanets. So far, it has identified nearly 6,400 candidate exoplanets (TESS Objects of Interest, or TOI), of which 3,031 have been confirmed so far.Now, a group of astronomers led by CfA's Kristo Ment reports the discovery of another extrasolar planet with TESS. They reveal that a transit signal was detected in the light curve of LHS 475\u2014a main-sequence red dwarf belonging to the M3 spectral class. The planetary nature of this signal was confirmed by follow-up ground-based photometry using the MEarth-South telescope array at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.\"Here we present the discovery and subsequent ground-based validation observations of LHS 475 b, a Venus-sized planet orbiting a nearby M dwarf,\" the researchers wrote in the paper.LHS 475 b has a radius of approximately 0.955 Earth radii and orbits its host every 48.7 hours, at a distance of about 0.02 AU from it. The planet's equilibrium temperature was estimated to be some 587 K, thus LHS 475 b is likely too hot to be habitable.However, the mass of LHS 475 b remains to be determined as the existing radial velocity data of LHS 475 does not have the necessary precision to calculate the mass of the planet. The astronomers noted that exoplanets of this size are highly likely to be terrestrial and might also have a similar interior composition to that of the Earth's.Therefore, in order to calculate the mass of LHS 475 b, the researchers adopted a simple two-layer composition model with an Earth-like core mass fraction (CMF) of 0.33. They inverted the empirical radius-mass relation (by Zeng et al. (2016)) and derived a planetary mass at a level of approximately 0.84 Earth masses.\"In accordance with the observed mass-radius distribution of exoplanets as well as planet formation theory, we expect this Venus-sized companion to be terrestrial, with an estimated RV [radial velocity] semi-amplitude close to 1.0 m/s,\" the authors of the paper explained.When it comes to the star LHS 475 b, it has a radius of 0.286 solar radii and its mass is about 0.274 solar masses. The star has a luminosity at a level of 0.0087 solar luminosities, effective temperature of 3,295 K and is located some 40.7 light years away from the Earth.

JUICE will set its sights on Ganymede, the Solar System's largest moon and the only one that has its own magnetic field, which protects it from radiation.In 2034, JUICE will slide into Ganymede's orbit, the first time a spacecraft will have done so around a moon other than our own.The mission will not be able to directly detect the existence of alien life, but instead aims to establish whether the moons have the right conditions to harbor life.                The mission aims to find out whether the vast oceans buried under the icy shells of the moons could support life.             The delayed launch of the 1.6 billion-euro ($1.7 billion) mission comes during a crisis for European space efforts, after Russia pulled its Soyuz rockets in response to sanctions over the war in Ukraine.Combined with repeated delays to the next generation Ariane 6 rockets and the failure of Vega-C's first commercial flight last year, Europe has been struggling to launch its missions into space.JUICE is expected be the second-last launch for Ariane 5 before it is replaced by the Ariane 6.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Europe's Jupiter probe set for new launch attempt (2023, April 14)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-europe-jupiter-probe.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "The update brings loads of improvements, the most significant being new driving capabilities.          Years in the making, a major software update that has been installed on NASA's Curiosity rover will enable the Mars robot to drive faster and reduce wear and tear on its wheels. Those are just two of about 180 changes implemented during the update, which required the team to put Curiosity's science and imaging operations on hold between April 3 and April 7.\"The flight software is essential to our mission, so this is a big deal for our team,\" said Curiosity Project Manager Kathya Zamora-Garcia of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"This is a major software update, and we had to make sure we did it right.\"Planning for this update goes back to 2016, when Curiosity last received a software overhaul. Some changes this time around are as small as making corrections to the messages the rover sends back to mission controllers on Earth. Others simplify computer code that has been altered by multiple patches since Curiosity touched down in 2012. The biggest changes will help keep Curiosity rolling more efficiently for years to come.The rover can now do more of what the team calls \"thinking while driving\"\u2014something NASA's newest Mars rover, Perseverance, can perform in a more advanced way to navigate around rocks and sand traps. When Perseverance drives, it constantly snaps pictures of the terrain ahead, processing them with a dedicated computer so it can autonomously navigate during one continuous drive.Curiosity doesn't have a dedicated computer for this purpose. Instead, it drives in segments, halting to process imagery of the terrain after each segment. That means it needs to start and stop repeatedly over the course of a long drive. The new software will help the venerable rover process images faster, allowing it to spend more time on the move.\"This won't let Curiosity drive as quickly as Perseverance, but instead of stopping for a full minute after a drive segment, we're stopping for just a moment or two,\" said Jonathan Denison of JPL, Curiosity's engineering operations team chief. \"Spending less time idling between drive segments also means we use less energy each day. And even though we're almost 11 years old, we're still implementing new ideas to use more of our available energy for science activities.\"Wheel wearThe team also wants to maintain the health of Curiosity's aluminum wheels, which began showing signs of broken treads in 2013. When engineers realized that sharp rocks were chipping away at the treads, they came up with an algorithm to improve traction and reduce wheel wear by adjusting the rover's speed depending on the rocks it's rolling over.The new software goes further by introducing two new mobility commands that reduce the amount of steering Curiosity needs to do while driving in an arc toward a specific waypoint. With less steering required, the team can reach the drive target quicker and decrease the wear that inherently comes with steering.\"That ability was actually dreamed up during the Spirit and Opportunity days,\" Denison said. \"It was a 'nice to have' they decided not to implement.\"Overall, the new software will streamline the task of Curiosity's human drivers, who have to write complex plans containing hundreds of commands. The software update will also enable them to upload software patches more easily than in past. And it will help engineers plan the motions of Curiosity's robotic arm more efficiently and point its \"head\" atop the mast more accurately.As with any major software update, there's a sense of relief to see it working as designed, Denison said.\"The idea of hitting the install button was a little scary,\" he added. \"Despite all our testing, we never know exactly what will happen until the software is up there.\" Provided byJPL/NASACitation:NASA's Curiosity Mars rover gets a major software upgrade (2023, April 13)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-nasa-curiosity-mars-rover-major.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "How did the most massive stars form? Astronomers have debated their origins for decades. One of the biggest problems facing these theories is the lack of observations. Massive stars are relatively rare, and so it's hard to catch them in the act of formation. But new observations of the so-called Dragon cloud may hold the clue to answering this mystery.          A team of astronomers used the ALMA telescope in the Atacama desert of Northern Chile to study the Dragon cloud, a dense cloud of molecular hydrogen that serves as the site of star formation throughout its complex. The astronomers specifically were looking for dust, which in addition to the gas that makes up the bulk of the complex collapses to form stars.The astronomers found several regions of active star formation, but also a strange dense clump lacking any newborn stars at all. Upon further investigation the team discovered that the central clump was actually composed of two separate regions. One of the regions contained over 30 solar masses worth of material, while the other contained just two solar masses worth of material.According to their observations those clumps were very dense and actively collapsing, implying that those clumps were going to soon start forming stars.Most importantly, the astronomers found that the clumps themselves were not appearing to fragment into smaller clumps as they collapsed. This leads credence to the \"core accretion\" model of star formation. In this model, the most massive stars collapse from single units of gas clouds and start their lives already with incredibly high masses. The observations support this idea because for the first time we have been able to observe a giant cloud of gas undergoing direct collapse without splitting apart.The astronomers have called for more detailed observations of the complex to further untangle the mystery of the formation of massive stars. Their findings are published on the arXiv preprint server. More information:A. T. Barnes et al, Mother of Dragons: A Massive, quiescent core in the dragon cloud (IRDC G028.37+00.07), arXiv (2023).

  "text": "Access to space is getting easier and more accessible as more and more platforms are coming online that can significantly decrease the cost of getting into Earth's orbit or even beyond. Now, another company has taken a step forward in making inexpensive, reusable access to space a reality. Dawn Aerospace, which operates out of the U.S., New Zealand, and the Netherlands, has successfully tested a prototype spaceplane.       This isn't Dawn's first success, as the company already has satellite propulsion systems in orbit on 15 different satellites. It isn't even its first successful space plane test\u2014they had previously completed some testing using jet engines. However, it is the first time the company has successfully tested a rocket-powered plane.The series of three tests happened at the end of March at the Glentanner Aerodrome in New Zealand, where the plane successfully fired its rocket engine. Clocking it at over 170 knots and 6,000 ft of altitude may not seem like much, but it is a first step for the technology. And it allowed the company to make a video with very catchy music they could share for their marketing campaign.Credit: Dawn AerospaceThe Mk II is a drone with no direct pilot in the cockpit, which has plenty of advantages, mainly due to decreases in the project's physical weight and the testing necessary to certify a vehicle for crewed flight. Unfortunately, that also means that Dawn will only be able to launch cargo rather than taking people into orbit, at least with the current iteration.Like many companies, Dawn has a phased approach to starting their commercial launch operations. These tests represent the beginning of the Mk II Aurora, which will eventually be able to fly up to 100 km to deposit payloads, then return to its runway, and repeat the process the same day. It hopes to be the first vehicle to be able to do so.On the other hand, Mk III will include a non-reusable second stage that will help lift payloads of up to a ton into suborbital flight and 250kg into orbit itself. Its plane-based first stage will again be reusable, but the second stage will be lost.Dawn isn\u2019t the only company working on this concept. Here\u2019s a UT video describing a competitor \u2013 AstroClipper. Credit: Universe TodayIf that business model sounds suspiciously like the recently bankrupted Virgin Orbit, that's because it is. Using a plane (which in Virgin Orbit's case was air-launched) to get relatively small payloads into orbit has been a common goal of several companies as they attempt to make access to space cheaper by making the vehicles that get there reusable. In this case, Dawn has succeeded where Virgin Orbit failed.It still has plenty of testing and development left to go before it can hit either the Mk II or III milestone, but this first rocket-powered test is a step in the right direction. And with this success, the country of New Zealand seems to be moving up in the list of the most consequential global powers in the race to decrease the cost of access to space.

  "text": "An international research team led by UTSA Associate Professor of Astrophysics Thayne Currie has made a breakthrough in accelerating the search for new planets.          In a paper published in Science, Currie reports the first exoplanet jointly discovered through direct imaging and precision astrometry, a new indirect method that identifies a planet by measuring the position of the star it orbits. Data from the Subaru Telescope in Hawai'i and space telescopes from the European Space Agency (ESA) were integral to the team's discovery.An exoplanet\u2014also called an extrasolar planet\u2014is a planet outside a solar system that orbits another star. With direct imaging, astronomers can see an exoplanet's light in a telescope and study its atmosphere. However, only about 20 have been directly imaged over the past 15 years.By contrast, indirect planet detection methods determine a planet's existence through its effect on the star it orbits. This approach can provide detailed measurements of the planet's mass and orbit.Combining direct and indirect methods to examine a planet's position provides a more complete understanding of an exoplanet, Currie says.\"Indirect planet detection methods are responsible for most exoplanet discoveries thus far. Using one of these methods, precision astrometry, told us where to look to try to image planets. And, as we found out, we can now see planets a lot easier,\" said Currie.

Currie/Subaru Telescope, UTSA             The newly discovered exoplanet, called HIP 99770 b, is about 14 to 16 times the mass of Jupiter and orbits a star that is nearly twice as massive as the sun. The planetary system also shares similarities with the outer regions of our solar system. HIP 99770 b receives about as much light as Jupiter, our solar system's most massive planet, receives from the sun. Its host star is surrounded by icy debris left over from planet formation, similar to our solar system's Kuiper belt, the ring of icy objects observed around the sun.Currie and team used the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalogue of Accelerations to advance their discovery of HIP 99770 b. The catalogue consists of data from ESA's Gaia mission and Hipparcos, Gaia's predecessor, providing a 25-year record of accurate star positions and motions. It revealed that the star HIP 99770 is likely being accelerated by the gravitational pull of an unseen planet.The team then used the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) instrument, which is permanently installed at the focus of the Subaru Telescope in Hawai'i, to image and confirm the existence of HIP 99770 b.

Currie/Subaru Telescope, UTSA             The discovery of HIP 99770 b is significant, because it opens a new avenue for scientists to discover and characterize exoplanets more comprehensively than ever before, Currie said, shedding light on the diversity and evolution of planetary systems. Using indirect methods to guide efforts to image planets may also someday lead scientists closer to the first images of other Earths.\"This is the first of many discoveries that we expect to have.

  "text": "Using first-of-their-kind observations from the James Webb Space Telescope, a University of Minnesota Twin Cities-led team looked more than 13 billion years into the past to discover a unique, minuscule galaxy that generated new stars at an extremely high rate for its size. The galaxy is one of the smallest ever discovered at this distance\u2014around 500 million years after the Big Bang\u2014and could help astronomers learn more about galaxies that were present shortly after the universe came into existence.          The paper is published in Science.The University of Minnesota researchers were one of the first teams to study a distant galaxy using the James Webb Space Telescope, and their findings will be among the first ever published.\"This galaxy is far beyond the reach of all telescopes except the James Webb, and these first-of-their-kind observations of the distant galaxy are spectacular,\" said Patrick Kelly, senior author of the paper and an assistant professor in the University of Minnesota School of Physics and Astronomy.\"Here, we're able to see most of the way back to the Big Bang, and we've never looked at galaxies when the universe was this young in this level of detail. The galaxy's volume is roughly a millionth of the Milky Way's, but we can see that it's still forming the same numbers of stars each year.\"The James Webb telescope can observe a wide enough field to image an entire galaxy cluster at once. The researchers were able to find and study this new, tiny galaxy because of a phenomenon called gravitational lensing\u2014where mass, such as that in a galaxy or galaxy cluster, bends and magnifies light. A galaxy cluster lens caused this small background galaxy to appear 20 times brighter than it would if the cluster were not magnifying its light.The researchers then used spectroscopy to measure how far away the galaxy was, in addition to some of its physical and chemical properties. Studying galaxies that were present when the universe was this much younger can help scientists get closer to answering a huge question in astronomy regarding how the universe became reionized.\"The galaxies that existed when the universe was in its infancy are very different from what we see in the nearby universe now,\" explained Hayley Williams, first author on the paper and a Ph.D. student at the Minnesota Institute for Astrophysics. \"This discovery can help us learn more about the characteristics of those first galaxies, how they differ from nearby galaxies, and how the earlier galaxies formed.\"The James Webb telescope can collect about 10 times as much light as the Hubble Space Telescope and is much more sensitive at redder, longer wavelengths in the infrared spectrum. This allows scientists to access an entirely new window of data, the researchers said.\"The James Webb Space Telescope has this amazing capability to see extremely far into the universe,\" Williams said. \"This is one of the most exciting things about this paper.

  "text": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) appears to be finding multiple galaxies that grew too massive too soon after the Big Bang, if the standard model of cosmology is to be believed.          In a study published in Nature Astronomy, Mike Boylan-Kolchin, an associate professor of astronomy at The University of Texas at Austin, finds that six of the earliest and most massive galaxy candidates observed by JWST so far stand to contradict the prevailing thinking in cosmology.That's because other researchers estimate that each galaxy is seen from between 500 and 700 million years after the Big Bang, yet measures more than 10 billion times as massive as our sun. One of the galaxies even appears to be more massive than the Milky Way, despite that our own galaxy had billions of more years to form and grow.\"If the masses are right, then we are in uncharted territory,\" Boylan-Kolchin said. \"We'll require something very new about galaxy formation or a modification to cosmology. One of the most extreme possibilities is that the universe was expanding faster shortly after the Big Bang than we predict, which might require new forces and particles.\"For galaxies to form so fast at such a size, they also would need to be converting nearly 100% of their available gas into stars.\"We typically see a maximum of 10% of gas converted into stars,\" Boylan-Kolchin said. \"So while 100% conversion of gas into stars is technically right at the edge of what is theoretically possible, it's really the case that this would require something to be very different from what we expect.\"For all of the breathless excitement it evokes, JWST has presented astronomers with an unsettling dilemma. If the masses and time since the Big Bang are confirmed for these galaxies, fundamental changes to the reigning model of cosmology\u2014what's called the dark energy + cold dark matter (\u039bCDM) paradigm, which has guided cosmology since the late 1990s\u2014could be needed.                Based on the standard model of cosmology, astronomers predict what fraction of the atoms in the universe (vertical axis) are contained in galaxies with a certain mass of stars or higher (horizontal axis). In this study, three galaxy candidates (indicated by a single point spread) appear to be using up a much larger fraction of available atoms for stars than expected. Instead of about 10% as is usual (blue arc), the data suggest these galaxy candidates have converted 100% of available atoms into stars. Credit: Mike Boylan-Kolchin/University of Texas at Austin             If there are other, faster ways to form galaxies than \u039bCDM allows, or if more matter actually was available for forming stars and galaxies in the early universe than was previously understood, astronomers would need to shift their prevailing thinking.      The six galaxies' times and masses are initial estimates and will need follow-up confirmation with spectroscopy\u2014a method that splits the light into a spectrum and analyzes the brightness of different colors. Such analysis might suggest that central supermassive black holes, which could heat up the surrounding gas, may be making the galaxies brighter so that they look more massive than they really are.Or perhaps the galaxies are actually seen at a time much later than originally estimated due to dust that causes the color of the light from the galaxy to shift redder, giving the illusion of being more lightyears away and, thus, further back in time.The galaxy data came from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS), a multi-institution JWST initiative led by UT Austin astronomer Steven Finkelstein.Another ongoing collaborative JWST project, COSMOS-Web, co-led by UT Austin's Caitlin Casey, may be involved with spectroscopy and shedding more light on the findings to help resolve the dilemma. COSMOS-Web is covering an area roughly 50 times larger than CEERS and is expected to discover thousands of galaxies.\"It will be ideal for discovering the rarest, most massive galaxies at early times, which will tell us how the biggest galaxies and black holes in the early universe arose so quickly,\" Boylan-Kolchin said.The initial discovery and estimates of the six galaxy candidates' masses and redshifts were published in Nature in February by a team led by Swinburne University of Technology in Australia.

  "answer_squad": " Keck II Telescope",
  "text": "Though we live in a vast three-dimensional universe, celestial objects seen through a telescope look flat because everything is so far away. Now for the first time, astronomers have measured the three-dimensional shape of one of the biggest and closest elliptical galaxies to us, M87. This galaxy turns out to be \"triaxial,\" or potato-shaped. This stereo vision was made possible by combining the power of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and the ground-based W. M. Keck Observatory on Maunakea, Hawaii.          In most cases, astronomers must use their intuition to figure out the true shapes of deep-space objects. For example, the whole class of huge galaxies called \"ellipticals\" look like blobs in pictures. Determining the true shape of giant elliptical galaxies will help astronomers understand better how large galaxies and their central large black holes form.Scientists made the 3D plot by measuring the motions of stars that swarm around the galaxy's supermassive central black hole. The stellar motion was used to provide new insights into the shape of the galaxy and its rotation, and it also yielded a new measurement of the black hole's mass. Tracking the stellar speeds and position allowed researchers to build a three-dimensional view of the galaxy.Astronomers at the University of California, Berkeley, were able to determine the mass of the black hole at the galaxy's core to a high precision, estimating it at 5.4 billion times the mass of the Sun. Hubble observations in 1995 first measured the M87 black hole as being 2.4 billion solar masses, which astronomers deduced by clocking the speed of the gas swirling around the black hole. When the Event Horizon Telescope, an international collaboration of ground-based telescopes, released the first-ever image of the same black hole in 2019, the size of its pitch-black event horizon allowed researchers to calculate a mass of 6.5 billion solar masses using Einstein's theory of general relativity.The stereo model of M87 and the more precise mass of the central black hole could help astrophysicists learn the black hole's spin rate. \"Now that we know the direction of the net rotation of stars in M87 and have an updated mass of the black hole, we can combine this information with data from the Event Horizon Telescope to constrain the spin,\" said Chung-Pei Ma, a UC Berkeley lead investigator on the research.This animation begins with a Hubble Space Telescope photo of the huge elliptical galaxy M87. It then fades to a computer model of M87. A grid is overlaid to trace out its three-dimensional shape, made more evident by rotating the model and grid. This shape was gleaned from meticulous observations made with the Hubble and Keck telescopes. Because the galaxy is too far away for astronomers to employ stereoscopic vision, they instead followed the motion of stars around the center of M87, like bees around a hive. This created a three-dimensional view of how stars are distributed within the galaxy that informed the model. Credit: ANIMATION: NASA, ESA, Joseph Olmsted (STScI), 3D MODEL: Frank Summers (STScI), SCIENCE: Chung-Pei Ma (UC Berkeley)Over ten times the mass of the Milky Way, M87 probably grew from the merger of many other galaxies. That's likely the reason M87's central black hole is so large\u2014it assimilated the central black holes of one or more galaxies it swallowed.      Ma, together with UC Berkeley graduate student Emily Liepold (lead author on the paper published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters) and Jonelle Walsh at Texas A&M University were able to determine the 3D shape of M87 thanks to a new precision instrument mounted on the Keck II Telescope. They pointed Keck at 62 adjacent locations of the galaxy, mapping out the spectra of stars over a region about 70,000 light-years across. This region spans the central 3,000 light-years where gravity is largely dominated by the supermassive black hole. Though the telescope cannot resolve individual stars because of M87's great distance, the spectra can reveal the range of velocities to calculate mass of the object they're orbiting.\"It's sort of like looking at a swarm of 100 billion bees,\" said Ma. \"Though we are looking at them from a distance and can't discern individual bees, we are getting very detailed information about their collective velocities.\"The researchers took the data between 2020 and 2022, as well as earlier star brightness measurements of M87 from Hubble, and compared them to computer model predictions of how stars move around the center of the triaxial-shaped galaxy. The best fit to this data allowed them to calculate the black hole's mass. \"Knowing the 3D shape of the 'swarming bees' enabled us to obtain a more robust dynamical measurement of the mass of the central black hole that is governing the bees' orbiting velocities,\" said Ma.In the 1920s, astronomer Edwin Hubble first classified galaxies according to their shapes. Flat disk spiral galaxies could be viewed from various projection angles of the sky: face-on, oblique, or edge-on. But the \"blobby-looking\" galaxies were more problematic to characterize. Hubble came up with the term elliptical. They could only be sorted out by how great the ellipticity was. They didn't have any apparent dust or gas inside of them for better distinguishing between them. Now, a century later astronomers have a stereoscopic look at a prototypical elliptical galaxy.

  "text": "Researchers using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have taken a first look at their data that probe the chemistry of the regions of disks around young stars where rocky planets form. Already at that stage, the data reveal the disks to be chemically diverse and rich in molecules such as water, carbon dioxide, and organic hydrocarbon compounds like benzene as well as tiny grains of carbon and silicates. The ongoing MPIA-led JWST observing program MINDS bringing together several European research institutes promises to provide a revolutionary view on the conditions that precede the birth of planets and, at the same time, determine their compositions.          New observations towards a sample of planet-forming disks around young stars obtained with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provide a first look into how this powerful tool will boost our understanding of terrestrial planet formation. Astronomers from 11 European countries have gathered in the MINDS (MIRI mid-Infrared Disk Survey) project to investigate the conditions in the inner regions of such disks where rocky planets are expected to form from the gas and dust they contain. They take the next step to decipher the conditions of planet-forming disks\u2014a prerequisite to identifying the processes leading to solid bodies, such as planets and comets, that comprise planetary systems.The initial results presented in two articles demonstrate the diversity of cradles of rocky planets. Disks range from environments rich in carbon-bearing compounds, including organic molecules as complex as benzene, to agglomerates containing carbon dioxide and traces of water. Like fingerprints, these chemicals produce uniquely identifiable markers in the spectra the astronomers obtained with their observations. A spectrum is a rainbow-like display of light or, as in this case, e.g., infrared radiation, splitting it into the colors of which it is composed.\"We're impressed by the quality of the data MIRI produced,\" says Thomas Henning, Director at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA) in Heidelberg, Germany. He is the principal investigator (PI) of the JWST Guaranteed Time Observation (GTO) program MINDS. \"This wealth of spectral lines does not only reveal the chemical composition of the disk material ultimately evolving into planets and their atmospheres. It also allows us to determine physical conditions like densities and temperatures across and inside those planet-forming disks, directly where the planets grow.\"      A dry protoplanetary disk with two kinds of carbon dioxide\"We can now study the chemical components in those disks much more precisely,\" says Sierra Grant, a post-doc at the Max Planck Institute for extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) in Garching, Germany. She is the main author of an article analyzing a disk around a young low-mass star that was published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. \"The warm inner disk around GW Lup appears to be rather dry. While we clearly detected molecules containing carbon and oxygen, there is much less water present than expected,\" Grant explains.A gap around the central star devoid of gas would explain the lack of water. \"If that hole extended until between the snowlines of water and carbon dioxide, it would explain why we find so little water vapor there,\" Grant says. The snowlines indicate ring-like zones at varying distances from the star where the temperatures drop to values where certain chemical species freeze out. The water snowline is closer to the star than the one for carbon dioxide.Therefore, if a cavity extends beyond the water snowline, the gas outside this perimeter would still contain carbon dioxide but only little water. Any planet forming there would initially be fairly dry. Therefore, small icy objects like comets from the outer planetary system could be the only substantial source of water. On the other hand, if a planet interacting with the disk were responsible for such a gap, this would suggest that the planet would have accumulated water during its formation.The team also detected for the first time a much rarer version of the carbon dioxide molecule in a protoplanetary disk containing a carbon atom that is slightly heavier than the much more frequent type. In contrast to the \"normal\" carbon dioxide that merely probes the warmer disk surface, the radiation of the heavier sibling can escape the disk from deeper and cooler layers. The analysis results in temperatures from around 200 Kelvin (-75 degrees Celsius) near the disk mid-plane to approximately 500 Kelvin (+225 degrees Celsius) at its surface.                This illustration shows the MIRI spectrum of the disk around the young star GW Lup in the range between 13.5 and 16.5 microns. By modelling the chemical content, the scientists reproduced the measured spectrum (top panel, black line). The total model (top panel, red area) is a combination of molecules (bottom panel) such as carbon dioxide (CO2, green and purple), water (H2O, blue), hydrogen cyanide (HCN, orange), hydroxyl (OH, pink), and acetylene (C2H2, yellow).

Grant et al / MPIA             Rich carbon chemistry in a disk around a very low-mass starLife seems to require carbon, forming complex compounds. While simple carbon-bearing molecules such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide pervade most planet-forming disks, the rich hydrocarbon chemistry of the following disk is quite unusual.\"The spectrum of the disk around the low-mass star J160532 reveals warm hydrogen gas and hydrogen-carbon compounds at temperatures around 230 degrees Celsius,\" says Beno\u00eet Tabone, CNRS researcher at the Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale, Paris-Saclay University, France, and the main author of another MINDS study, which is available on the arXiv pre-print server. The strongest spectral signal stems from hot acetylene molecules, each consisting of two carbon and two hydrogen atoms.Other equally warm gases of organic molecules are diacetylene and benzene, the first detections in a protoplanetary disk, and probably also methane. These detections indicate that this disk contains more carbon than oxygen. Such a mixture in chemical composition could also influence the atmospheres of planets forming there. In contrast, water seems almost absent. Instead, most of the water may be locked up in icy pebbles of the colder outer disk, not traceable by these observations.Eruptions of young stars produce seeds for planetsBesides gas, solid material is a typical constituent of protoplanetary disks. Much of it consists of silicate grains, basically fine sand. They grow from nanoparticles to randomly structured micron-sized aggregates. When heated, they can assume crystalline structures. A work published by a team led by \u00c1gnes K\u00f3sp\u00e1l (MPIA and Konkoly Observatory, Budapest, Hungary), which is not part of the MINDS program, demonstrates how such crystals may enter the rocky pebbles that eventually build terrestrial planets. Scientists find such crystals also in comets and Earth's crust. That work is also published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.The team rediscovered crystals detected years ago in the disk around the recurrently erupting star EX Lup, just recovering from a recent outburst. It provided the necessary heat for the crystallization process. After a period of absence, these crystals now reappeared in their spectra, albeit at much lower temperatures putting them farther away from the star. This rediscovery indicates that repeated outbursts may be essential in providing some of the building blocks of planetary systems.                This illustration shows the MIRI spectrum of the disk around the young star J160532 in the range between 14.5 and 16.0 microns with the dominating acetylene emission removed. By modelling the chemical content, the scientists reproduced the measured spectrum (top panel, black line). The total model (top panel, red area) is a combination of molecules (bottom panel) such as carbon dioxide (CO2, blue), benzene (C6H6, red), acetylene (C2H2, green), and diacetylene (C4H2, orange).

Tabone et al / MPIA             A golden age of astronomical researchThese results show that JWST's arrival ushers in a new golden age in astronomical research. Already at that early stage, the findings are groundbreaking. \"We're looking forward to what other news JWST will bring,\" Henning declares. Altogether, the MINDS program will target the disks of 50 young low-mass stars. \"We're eager to learn about the diversity we'll find.\"\"By refining the models used to interpret the spectra, we will also improve the results at hand. Eventually, we want to exploit JWST's and MIRI's full capabilities to examine those planetary cradles,\" adds Inga Kamp, a MINDS collaborator and a scientist at Kapteyn Astronomical Institute of the University of Groningen, The Netherlands.Learning about the formation of planets around very low-mass stars, i.e., stars about five to ten times less massive than the sun, is particularly rewarding. Rocky planets are over-abundant around those stars, with many potentially habitable planets already detected. Therefore, the MINDS program promises to clarify some of the key questions about the formation of Earth-like planets and perhaps the emergence of life.Background informationThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the largest, most powerful telescope ever launched into space. It is an international partnership between NASA, ESA and CSA.JWST's Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI), built by a European consortium of research institutions, is a multi-purpose scientific instrument for infrared wavelengths between 5 and 28 microns. It combines an imaging camera with a spectrograph. With the support of industrial partners, MPIA provided the mechanisms of all wavelength-selecting elements, such as filter and grating wheels, and led MIRI's electrical design.

  "text": "The iconic image of the supermassive black hole at the center of M87\u2014sometimes referred to as the \"fuzzy, orange donut\"\u2014has gotten its first official makeover with the help of machine learning. The new image further exposes a central region that is larger and darker, surrounded by the bright accreting gas shaped like a \"skinny donut.\" The team used the data obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration in 2017 and achieved, for the first time, the full resolution of the array.          In 2017, the EHT collaboration used a network of seven pre-existing telescopes around the world to gather data on M87, creating an \"Earth-sized telescope.\" However, since it is infeasible to cover the Earth's entire surface with telescopes, gaps arise in the data\u2014like missing pieces in a jigsaw puzzle.\"With our new machine learning technique, PRIMO, we were able to achieve the maximum resolution of the current array,\" says lead author Lia Medeiros of the Institute for Advanced Study. \"Since we cannot study black holes up-close, the detail of an image plays a critical role in our ability to understand its behavior. The width of the ring in the image is now smaller by about a factor of two, which will be a powerful constraint for our theoretical models and tests of gravity.\"PRIMO, which stands for principal-component interferometric modeling, was developed by EHT members Lia Medeiros (Institute for Advanced Study), Dimitrios Psaltis (Georgia Tech), Tod Lauer (NOIRLab), and Feryal \u00d6zel (Georgia Tech). Their publication, \"The Image of the M87 Black Hole Reconstructed with PRIMO,\" is now available in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.Overview of simulations that were generated for the training set of the PRIMO algorithm. Credit: Medeiros et al. 2023\"PRIMO is a new approach to the difficult task of constructing images from EHT observations,\" said Lauer. \"It provides a way to compensate for the missing information about the object being observed, which is required to generate the image that would have been seen using a single gigantic radio telescope the size of the Earth.\"PRIMO relies on dictionary learning, a branch of machine learning which enables computers to generate rules based on large sets of training material. For example, if a computer is fed a series of different banana images\u2014with sufficient training\u2014it may be able to determine if an unknown image is or is not a banana. Beyond this simple case, the versatility of machine learning has been demonstrated in numerous ways: from creating Renaissance-style works of art to completing the unfinished work of Beethoven. So how might machines help scientists to render a black hole image? The research team has answered this very question.      With PRIMO, computers analyzed over 30,000 high-fidelity simulated images of black holes accreting gas. The ensemble of simulations covered a wide range of models for how the black hole accretes matter, looking for common patterns in the structure of the images. The various patterns of structure were sorted by how commonly they occurred in the simulations, and were then blended to provide a highly accurate representation of the EHT observations, simultaneously providing a high fidelity estimate of the missing structure of the images. A paper pertaining to the algorithm itself was published in The Astrophysical Journal on February 3, 2023.

Credit: Medeiros et al. 2023             \"We are using physics to fill in regions of missing data in a way that has never been done before by using machine learning,\" added Medeiros. \"This could have important implications for interferometry, which plays a role in fields from exo-planets to medicine.\"The team confirmed that the newly rendered image is consistent with the EHT data and with theoretical expectations, including the bright ring of emission expected to be produced by hot gas falling into the black hole. Generating an image required assuming an appropriate form of the missing information, and PRIMO did this by building on the 2019 discovery that the M87 black hole in broad detail looked as predicted.\"Approximately four years after the first horizon-scale image of a black hole was unveiled by EHT in 2019, we have marked another milestone, producing an image that utilizes the full resolution of the array for the first time,\" stated Psaltis. \"The new machine learning techniques that we have developed provide a golden opportunity for our collective work to understand black hole physics.\"Animation fades from M87black hole image, first produced by the EHT collaboration in 2019, to the new image generated by the PRIMO algorithm using the same data set. Credit: Medeiros et al. 2023The new image should lead to more accurate determinations of the mass of the M87 black hole and the physical parameters that determine its present appearance. The data also provides an opportunity for researchers to place greater constraints on alternatives to the event horizon (based on the darker central brightness depression) and perform more robust tests of gravity (based on the narrower ring size). PRIMO can also be applied to additional EHT observations, including those of Sgr A*, the central black hole in our own Milky Way galaxy.M87 is a massive, relatively nearby, galaxy in the Virgo cluster of galaxies. Over a century ago, a mysterious jet of hot plasma was observed to emanate from its center. Beginning in the 1950s, the then new technique of radio astronomy showed the galaxy to have a compact bright radio source at its center. During the 1960s, M87 had been suspected to have a massive black hole at its center powering this activity. Measurements made from ground-based telescopes starting in the 1970s, and later the Hubble Space Telescope starting in the 1990s, provided strong support that M87 indeed harbored a black hole weighing several billion times the mass of the sun based on observations of the high velocities of stars and gas orbiting its center. The 2017 EHT observations of M87 were obtained over several days from several different radio telescopes linked together at the same time to obtain the highest possible resolution. The now iconic \"orange donut\" picture of the M87 black hole, released in 2019, reflected the first attempt to produce an image from these observations.\"The 2019 image was just the beginning,\" stated Medeiros. \"If a picture is worth a thousand words, the data underlying that image have many more stories to tell. PRIMO will continue to be a critical tool in extracting such insights.\" More information:Lia Medeiros et al, The Image of the M87 Black Hole Reconstructed with PRIMO, Astrophysical Journal Letters (2023).

  "answer_squad": " JUICE mission",
  "text": "The launch of the European Space Agency's JUICE mission, which aims to discover whether Jupiter's icy moons are capable of hosting extraterrestrial life, was postponed on Thursday for 24 hours due to bad weather.          The launch was called off just minutes before the planned lift-off at 1215 GMT from Europe's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, because of the threat of lightning in the cloudy skies overhead.The next attempt will take place at 1214 GMT on Friday, the European Space Agency said.Stephane Israel, the CEO of French firm Arianespace which provided the Ariane 5 rocket, said that with just minutes to spare, \"a large mass of clouds approached and we absolutely could not proceed with the launch due to the risk of lightning\".For lift-off to go ahead, three parameters must get the green light: the launcher, the probe and the weather\u2014which was \"the final suspense,\" he told AFP.While the winds are expected to allow a green light on Friday, the risk of lightning will be monitored \"until the last moment,\" he added.Unlike most launches, JUICE has a launch window of a just a single second because of the specific trajectory it is aiming for.The delay was announced to the Jupiter control room in Kourou, where many people, including Belgium's King Philippe, had gathered to watch the launch.                Jupiter's moons, Ganymede, Europa and Callisto, which will be explored by the ESA's mission JUICE.             Liquid water oceansIf the weather permits a launch on Friday, the JUpiter ICy Moons Explorer (JUICE) is still on track to arrive at the gas giant in July 2031.The uncrewed, six-tonne spacecraft will investigate Jupiter's icy moons, which were first discovered by astronomer Galileo Galilei more than 400 years ago.The discovery of huge oceans of liquid water\u2014the main ingredient for life as we know it\u2014kilometers beneath their icy shells has made them prime candidates to potentially host life in our celestial backyard.Once launched, JUICE will take a long and winding path to Jupiter, which is some 628 million kilometers (390 million miles) from Earth, using other planets for a gravitational boost along the way.First, it will do a fly-by of Earth and the Moon, then will slingshot around Venus in 2025 before swinging past Earth again in 2029.Once the probe arrives in 2031, it will need to very carefully hit the brakes to enter Jupiter's orbit.                The moon Ganymede lurks behind the gas giant Jupiter in a Hubble telescope image from 2008.             From there, JUICE will focus on Jupiter and its three icy, ocean-bearing moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.Its 10 scientific instruments\u2014including an optical camera, ice-penetrating radar, spectrometer and magnetometer\u2014will analyze the local weather, magnetic field, gravitational pull and other elements.It also has a record 85 square meters of solar panels to collect as much energy as possible near Jupiter, where sunlight is 25 times weaker than on Earth.Philippe Baptiste, head of France's CNES space agency, said it was \"the most complex probe ever sent to Jupiter\".      First in another moon's orbitJUICE will then set its sights on Ganymede, the Solar System's largest moon and the only one that has its own magnetic field, which protects it from radiation.In 2034, JUICE will slide into Ganymede's orbit, the first time a spacecraft will have done so around a moon other than our own.                JUICE will use its 10 scientific instruments to inspect Jupiter and its icy moons.             The mission will not be able to directly detect the existence of alien life, but instead aims to establish whether the moons have the right conditions to harbor life.If there is life in these buried oceans, scientists theorize it would likely be primitive microbes like bacteria, which are capable of surviving on Earth in such extreme environments.Europa, another prime candidates for alien life, will be investigated by NASA's Europa Clipper mission, which is scheduled to launch in October 2024.The postponement of the 1.6 billion-euro ($1.7 billion) JUICE mission comes during a crisis for European space efforts, after Russia pulled its Soyuz rockets in response to sanctions over the war in Ukraine.Combined with repeated delays to the next generation Ariane 6 rockets and the failure of Vega-C's first commercial flight last year, Europe is struggling to launch its missions into space.The JUICE mission is expected be the second-last launch for Ariane 5 before it is replaced by the Ariane 6.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Weather delays launch of Europe's Jupiter mission by 24 hours (Update) (2023, April 13)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-europe-juice-mission-jupiter-icy.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "The Hybrid Engine Development (HyEnD) student team at the University of Stuttgart has spent around three years developing, manufacturing, and testing its hybrid rocket. In mid-April, the rocket will be launched into space from the Esrange rocket launch site near Kiruna in Sweden. If all goes well, the students will set a new world altitude record for student-built rockets.          The hybrid rocket is 7.80 meters long and weighs around 70 kg. It was built by approximately 60 students from the University Group HyEnD of the University of Stuttgart. \"It's one of the most powerful and advanced student-built hybrid rockets in the world,\" says Max \u00d6chsle, HyEnD project manager. With this, the students have big plans: They want to beat their own altitude record of 32 km for student-built hybrid rockets, which they set in 2016.The students also hope to cross the boundary into space at an altitude of 100 km. In addition to the world record for hybrid rockets, this also makes the world record for student-built rockets in general possible. The previous record is 103.6 km and was set by the University of Southern California (USCRPL) team in 2019. \"The world record is within our reach. We could indeed beat it,\" says \u00d6chsle. \u00d6chsle is well aware that the record depends on other factors such as the weather.It is still unclear exactly when the record attempt will take place. The window is scheduled between April 14 and 25. Because the schedule could be changed at short notice, HyEnD provides regular updates on its website. In addition, a livestream of the launch is planned on the Youtube channel of the Swedish Space Agency SSC. On site in Sweden are 16 members of the student group, including \u00d6chsle, the 25-year-old project leader.                The first test of the assembly of the rocket components.

Over the past three years, a lot of blood, sweat, and tears have gone into this project. The countdown to the launch will certainly be exciting. But we are confident that everything will go according to plan. Of course, I'm most looking forward to the moment when the rocket takes off,\" says \u00d6chsle.In order to be on the safe side, the students have two identical rockets on site. On one hand so they have a back-up in case something breaks during launch preparations. On the other hand, because the rocket project is quite ambitious for a group of students. For the first flight of an untested rocket, there are restrictions on the launch angle and thus on the flight altitude. If the first flight goes well, students hope to fly higher on the second launch.Credit: University of StuttgartHybrid engine delivers 1.5 t of thrustThe N2ORTH rocket has a hybrid engine that uses solid fuel and liquid nitrous oxide. The name N2ORTH alludes to both nitrous oxide (N2O), which is used as an oxidizer, and the launch site in the North. In order to make it as light as possible, it was built almost entirely of composite materials.\"We are particularly proud of the engine, which we developed ourselves. With its thrust of up to 1.5 t, it is one of the most powerful and efficient student made engines in the world. Another special feature is the parachute, which must be able to withstand supersonic speeds. Because there are no commercial parachutes available for these requirements, we made it ourselves,\" says \u00d6chsle.Because of the high flight speeds, the rocket shell is exposed to enormous temperatures. The structural parts were therefore laminated with a high-temperature epoxy system developed in-house. The rocket also has a thermal protection layer made of cork. The students manufactured most of the components themselves in the workshops of the University of Stuttgart.

  "answer_squad": " MUSE",
  "text": "On Oct. 11, 2022, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope spent over 20 hours observing the long-studied Hubble Ultra Deep Field for the first time. The general observer program (GO 1963) focused on analyzing the field in wavelengths between approximately 2 and 4 microns.          We spoke with Christina Williams (NOIRLab), Sandro Tacchella (University of Cambridge), and Michael Maseda (University of Wisconsin-Madison) to learn more about the first observation of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field through Webb's eyes.What is important for people to know about these Webb observations?Michael Maseda: The fact that we see hot, ionized gas is telling us exactly where stars are being born in these galaxies. Now we can separate those areas from where stars already existed. That piece of information is very important because, billions of years later, we don't exactly know how galaxies became how they are today. It's important to note that we still haven't seen everything there is to see. Our whole program was ~24 hours, which isn't that much time in the grand scheme of how much time other observatories have looked at it. But, even in this relatively short amount of time, we're starting to put together a new picture of how galaxies are growing at this really interesting point in the history of the Universe.What are you interested in learning by exploring the Hubble Ultra Deep Field with Webb?Christina Williams: We proposed to image the Ultra Deep Field using some of Webb's NIRCam's medium-band image filters, which allowed us to take images of spectral features more accurately than we could with broadband filters because medium-band filters span a shorter wavelength range. This gives us more sensitivity in measuring colors, which helps us understand the history of star formation and ionization properties of galaxies during the first billion years of the universe, like in the Reionization Era. Measuring the energy that galaxies produced in that time will help us understand how galaxies reionized the universe, reverting it from being neutral gas to once again being an ionized plasma like it was after the big bang.Sandro Tacchella: One of the key outstanding questions in extragalactic astrophysics is how the first galaxies form. Since the medium bands cover a range of different wavelengths, we can either directly find the some of the first galaxies in the early universe, or we can age-date the stars in galaxies when the universe was about one billion years old to understand when the galaxy actually formed their stars in the past. This survey helps to pin down the formation of the first galaxies.Michael Maseda: The capabilities that we have with Webb's medium-band filters are actually quite new. We're getting a sort of hybrid between imaging and spectroscopy, so we're getting detailed information for basically all of the galaxies in the field, as opposed to traditional spectroscopy where you could only select a few galaxies in the field of view for study. It's really a complete picture in the sense that this information complements a lot of existing data, not only from Hubble, but ground-based instrumentation like MUSE (the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) on the Very Large Telescope, where we have spectroscopy at different wavelengths for a number of these objects. MUSE is very good at finding galaxies that have Lyman-alpha emission, or light from ionized hydrogen in these galaxies, which are the type of galaxies that existed when reionization was ending. This new data is a missing piece that we did not have before in terms of understanding the full population of galaxies in this field.                The capabilities of NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope\u2019s Near-Infrared Camera are on full display in this comparison between Hubble\u2019s and Webb\u2019s observation of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. The left, which demonstrates Hubble\u2019s observation with its Wide Field Camera 3, required an exposure time of 11.3 days, while the right only took 0.83 days. Several areas within the Webb image reveal previously invisible, red galaxies. Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI,\u00a0C. Williams (University of Arizona). Image processing: J. DePasquale (STScI).             Was there anything unexpected in these data that surprised you?Michael Maseda: I don't know if I was surprised exactly, but the images were even better than I was expecting. In these images, you can actually see by eye that this is ionized gas over a fairly large area. I was expecting everything to be unresolved, but we have a high-enough resolution to actually see it. And I'm pleased to see it because it could have been a lot harder to understand what was happening.Christina Williams: I think that seeing how beautiful the images are and how high quality they ended up being was definitely a high point. We calculated that we would be able to do things like this, but it was different to see it and have the real data in practice.Why did you elect to make the data immediately public?Sandro Tacchella: Galaxies are very complex systems in which a wide range of different processes work on different spatial and temporal scales, so there are many approaches that can be used to better understand the physics of galaxies. So, making it available to many different groups will facilitate the search for more insight.Christina Williams: Webb is still very new, and people are still learning the best practices of how to analyze data sets. So, it benefits everyone to have a few data sets that are available immediately to help people understand the best way to make use of Webb data moving forward, and to better plan programs in future cycles that are based on real experience with data Provided byWebb Space TelescopeCitation:Webb shows areas of new star formation and galactic evolution (2023, April 12)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-webb-areas-star-formation-galactic.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "An international team of researchers from the University of Li\u00e8ge (Belgium) and Monash University (Australia) has just published the results of the analysis of data from the SPHERE instrument of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), which confirms a new protoplanet. This result was made possible by advanced image processing tools developed by the PSILab of the University of Li\u00e8ge.       The study is published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters.Planets form from clumps of material in disks surrounding newborn stars. When the planet is still forming, i.e., when it is still gathering material, it is called a protoplanet. To date, only two protoplanets had been unambiguously identified as such, PDS 70 b and c, both orbiting the star PDS 70. This number has now been increased to three, with the discovery and confirmation of a protoplanet in the disk of gas and dust surrounding HD 169142, a star 374 light years from our solar system.\"We used observations from the SPHERE instrument of the European Southern Observatory's (ESO) Very Large Telescope (VLT) obtained on the star HD 169142, which was observed several times between 2015 and 2019,\" explains Iain Hammond, a researcher at Monash University (Australia) who studied at ULi\u00e8ge as part of his doctoral thesis.A series of images of the HD 169142 system showing the planet in formation HD 169142 b moving in its orbit over time. A bright spiral arm is visible in the wake of the planet, resulting from the dynamic interaction between the planet and the disk in which it lies. The signal from the star, which is 100,000 times brighter than the planet, was subtracted by a combination of optical components and image processing (mask in the center of the image). Images obtained with ESO's VLT/SPHERE instrument. Credit: ESO/VLT\"As we expect planets to be hot when they form, the telescope took infrared images of HD 169142 to look for the thermal signature of their formation. With these data, we were able to confirm the presence of a planet, HD 169142 b, about 37 AU (37 astronomical units, or 37 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun) from its star\u2014slightly further than the orbit of Neptune.\"Back in 2019, a team of researchers led by R. Gratton had previously hypothesized that a compact source seen in their images could trace a protoplanet. The new study confirms this hypothesis through both a re-analysis of the data used in their study as well as the inclusion of new observations of better quality.The different images, obtained with VLT's SPHERE instrument between 2015 and 2019, reveal a compact source that is moving over time as expected for a planet orbiting at 37 astronomical units from its star. All data sets obtained with the SPHERE instrument were analyzed with state-of-the-art image processing tools developed by the PSILab team at the University of Li\u00e8ge.      \"The last data set considered in our study, obtained in 2019, is crucial for the confirmation of the planet's motion,\" explains Valentin Christiaens, researcher at the PSILab of the University of Li\u00e8ge. \"This data set had not been published until now.\"The new images also confirm that the planet must have carved an annular gap in the disk\u2014as predicted by the models. This gap is clearly visible in polarized light observations of the disk. \"In the infrared, we can also see a spiral arm in the disk, caused by the planet and visible in its wake, suggesting that other protoplanetary disks containing spirals may also harbor yet undiscovered planets,\" says Hammond.The polarized light images, as well as the infrared spectrum measured by the research team, further indicate that the planet is buried in a significant amount of dust that it has accreted from the protoplanetary disk. This dust could be in the form of a circumplanetary disk, a small disk that forms around the planet itself, which in turn could form moons. This important discovery demonstrates that the detection of planets by direct imaging is possible even at a very early stage of their formation.\"There have been many false positives among the detections of planets in formation over the last ten years,\" says Valentin Christiaens. \"Apart from the protoplanets of the PDS 70 system, the status of the other candidates is still hotly debated in the scientific community. The protoplanet HD 169142 b seems to have different properties to the protoplanets of the PDS 70 system, which is very interesting. It seems that we have captured it at a younger stage of its formation and evolution, as it is still completely buried in or surrounded by a lot of dust.\"Given the very small number of confirmed forming planets to date, the discovery of this source and its follow-up should give us a better understanding of how planets, and in particular giant planets such as Jupiter, are formed.Further characterization of the protoplanet and independent confirmation could be obtained through future observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The high sensitivity of JWST to infrared light should indeed allow researchers to detect thermal emission from the hot dust around the planet.

  "text": "Headlines proclaiming the rise of a new \"space race\" between the U.S. and China have become common in news coverage following many of the exciting launches in recent years. Experts have pointed to China's rapid advancements in space as evidence of an emerging landscape where China is directly competing with the U.S. for supremacy.          This idea of a space race between China and the U.S. sounds convincing given the broader narrative of China's rise, but how accurate is it? As a professor who studies space and international relations, my research aims to quantify the power and capabilities of different nations in space. When I look at various capacities, the data paints a much more complex picture than a tight space race between the U.S. and China. At least for now, the reality looks more like what I call a complex hegemony\u2014one state, the U.S., is still dominating in key space capabilities, and this lead is further amplified by a strong network of partners.A clear leader makes for a boring raceCalling the current situation a race implies that the U.S. and China have roughly equal capabilities in space. But in several key areas, the U.S. is far ahead not only of China, but of all other spacefaring nations combined.Starting with spending: In 2021, the U.S. space budget was roughly US$59.8 billion. China has been investing heavily in space and rocket technology over the last decade and has doubled its spending in the last five years. But with an estimated budget of $16.18 billion in 2021, it is still spending less than a third of the U.S. budget.The U.S. also leads significantly in the number of active satellites. Currently, there are 5,465 total operational satellites in orbit around Earth. The U.S. operates 3,433, or 63% of those. In contrast, China has 541.Similarly, the U.S. has more active spaceports than China. With seven operational launch sites at home and abroad and at least 13 additional spaceports in development, the U.S. has more options to launch payloads into various orbits. In contrast, China has only four operational spaceports with two more planned, all located within its own territory.      Parity with nuanceWhile the U.S. may have a clear advantage over China in many areas of space, in some measures, the differences between the two countries are more nuanced.In 2021, for instance, China attempted 55 orbital launches, four more than the U.S.'s 51. The total numbers may be similar, but the rockets carried very different payloads to orbit. The vast majority\u201484%\u2014of Chinese launches had government or military payloads intended mostly for electronic intelligence and optical imaging. Meanwhile, in the U.S., 61% of launches were for nonmilitary, academic or commercial use, predominantly for Earth observation or telecommunications.Space stations are another area where there are important differences hiding beneath the surface. Since the 1990s, the U.S. has worked with 14 other nations, including Russia, to operate the International Space Station. The ISS is quite large, with 16 modules, and has driven technological and scientific breakthroughs. But the ISS is now 24 years old, and participating nations are planning to retire it in 2030.The Chinese Tiangong space station is the new kid on the block. Construction was only completed in late 2022, and it is much smaller\u2014with only three modules. China has built and launched all of the different parts and remains the sole operator of the station, despite having invited others to join.China is undoubtedly expanding its space capabilities, and in a report published in August 2022, the Pentagon predicted that China would surpass U.S. capabilities in space as early as 2045. However, it is unlikely that the U.S. will remain stagnant, as it continues to increase funding for space.Allies as force multipliersA major point of difference between the U.S. and China is the nature and number of international collaborations.For decades, NASA has been fruitfully cultivating international and commercial partnerships in everything from developing specific space technologies to flying humans into space. The U.S. government has also signed 169 space data sharing agreements with 33 states and intergovernmental organizations, 129 with commercial partners and seven with academic institutions.China also has allies that help with space\u2014most notably Russia and members of the Asia-Pacific Space Cooperation Organization, including Iran, Pakistan, Thailand and Turkey. China's collaborators are, however, fewer in number and have far less developed space capabilities.Efforts to return to the surface of the Moon excellently highlight this difference in ally support and synergy. Both the U.S. and China have plans to send people to the surface of the Moon and to establish lunar bases in the near future. These competing lunar aims are often cited as evidence of the space race, but they are very different in terms of partnerships and scope.In 2019, Russia and China agreed to jointly go to the Moon by 2028. Russia is contributing its Luna landers and Oryol crewed orbiters, while China is improving its Chang'e robotic spacecraft. Their future International Lunar Research Station is \"open to all interested parties and international partners,\" but, to date, no additional countries have committed to the Chinese and Russian effort.In contrast, since 2020, 24 nations have joined the U.S.-led Artemis Accords. This international agreement outlines shared principles of cooperation for future space activity and, through the Artemis Program, specifically aims to return people to the Moon by 2025 and establish a Moon base and lunar space station soon after.In addition to the broad international participation, the Artemis Program has contracted with a staggering number of private companies to develop a range of technologies, from lunar landers to lunar construction methods and more.China is not the only game in townWhile China may seem like the main competitor of the U.S. in space, other countries have space capabilities and aspirations that rival those of China.India spends billions on space and plans to return to the Moon, possibly with Japan, in the near future. South Korea, Israel, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Germany and the European Union are also planning independent lunar missions. Japan has developed impressive technological space capabilities, including rendezvous proximity technology to send a spacecraft to an asteroid and bring samples back to Earth, that rival and even surpass those of China.In the past, the space race was about who could reach the stars first and return home. Today, the goal has shifted to surviving and even thriving in the harsh environment of space. I believe it is not surprising that, despite its decisive lead, the U.S. has partnered with others to go to the Moon and beyond. China is doing the same, but on a smaller scale. The picture that emerges is not of a \"race\" but of complex system with the U.S. as a leader working closely with extensive networks of partners.

  "text": "A new paper published by Florida Tech astrobiologist Manasvi Lingam examines a core question: Is technology-based intelligence more likely to evolve on land or in water?          \"A Bayesian Analysis of Technological Intelligence in Land and Oceans,\" a paper by Lingam and researchers from the University of Texas and Universit\u00e0 di Roma, was published in the March edition of The Astrophysical Journal.Humans are a classic example of the kind of technological intelligence that can profoundly sculpt the biosphere through purposeful activities and produce detectable signatures of their technology. In the paper, the authors performed a Bayesian analysis of the probability of technologically intelligent species existing in land-based habitats and ocean-based habitats. It was found that ocean-based habitats should be more likely to host technological species, if all other factors are held equal, because ocean worlds are likely to be much more common.\"And yet, we find ourselves having emerged on land instead of oceans, so there's a paradox, broadly speaking, out there,\" Lingam said.The paper also explored possibilities of how the emergence of intelligent technology-based life may be disfavored in the ocean, thereby dissolving this paradox.                The probability P(L\u2223TI) for TIs corresponding to LBHs as a function of the emergence rate of TIs in LBHs (units of Gyr\u22121). The vertical line is an estimate of the median value of this rate, based on the data from Earth. Credit: The Astrophysical Journal (2023). DOI: 10.3847/1538-4357/acb6fa             \"We say that, well, maybe it takes a really long time for life to emerge in the ocean because of various biophysical reasons such as the sensory capacities in land versus water,\" Lingam said.\"Another possibility is, due to some set of factors (e.g., energy sources), maybe oceans are not as habitable for intelligent life as we think they ought to be. Currently, the conventional thinking is that liquid water is needed for life. Well, maybe it is indeed imperative for life, but maybe an excess of it (i.e., only oceans) hampers technological intelligence in some ways. So that was another solution to the paradox we came up with.\"The team was able to come to the conclusions in the paper through synthesizing two distinct avenues. First, they drew extensively on data from Earth to ascertain what intelligent life on this planet has looked like, ranging from primates to cephalopods (e.g., octopuses) and cetaceans (e.g., dolphins). Looking at the cognitive toolkit of humans, Lingam said they sought to understand in what subtle ways human abilities differ from the cognitive capacity of marine life such as whales and dolphins. The second part of the research involved mathematics and physics, specifically Bayesian probability theory, which enables one to calculate the relevant probabilities based on some initial expectations.      While the conclusions in the paper were derived on a probabilistic basis, Lingam said there is still a lot of multidisciplinary work that can be done with refining and extending the models.\"I think one of the nice things about this model is that some of the assumptions can be tested,\" Lingam said. \"They can either be gauged by future observational data from telescopes, or some of them can be tested by conducting experiments and field studies on earth, such as looking further at ethology (animal behavior), delving further into how cognition operates on land-based animals versus aquatic animals. I think there's a lot of different animals that could be further assessed to refine the study. All these questions can, and hopefully should, attract people from a very wide range of fields.\"For Lingam, future work pertaining to this study will include grappling with the metabolic role of oxygen in shaping the evolution of complex life and how ubiquitous the element may be on various planets. He will also aim to understand what role the levels of oxygen concentration could have on the evolution of intelligent life.

  "text": "Meteorite impacts can be cataclysmic events in the history of a planet, melting rock, changing atmospheric chemistry, and wreaking general havoc.          However, impacts may also have created Earth's continents, supported ecological niches that kick-started life, and even developed metal ores.In a new study published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, we examined what's left of the world's oldest known impact crater: the 2.29 billion-year-old site at Yarrabubba in Western Australia.We found evidence hot water circulated in fractures in the rock after the impact, possibly because the impact melted some of the ice that covered much of the planet at that time. Hot water in fractured rock may have provided a niche for early life-forms, and its presence also has implications for our understanding of how deposits of metal ore form in Earth's crust.Space rocks have been key players in Earth's historyMeteorite impacts appear to come and go in a 200 million year cycle over the course of Earth's history.Across the planet, about 200 major impact sites have been documented. The oldest of these is at Yarrabubba in Western Australia.More than two billion years ago, a space rock slammed into the continental crust at Yarrabubba. This ancient crust had formed some 2.65 billion years before the present and was intensely changed by the impact.The result was a crater with an estimated diameter of about 70km, which is nowadays eroded to a mere pimple. The shock of the impact was so great it even melted parts of the surrounding crust, which is made of granite\u2014a common type of rock you might see in fancy kitchen bench tops.In our new research, we took a close look at what the impact did to the chemistry of the crust. The chemical effects of meteorite impacts are not often explored, but they may be important in understanding the full range of environmental consequences.      CSI: RockGeologists forensically study minerals trapped in rocks to investigate what happens inside Earth, in much the same way that crime scene investigators study materials at a scene to determine their origins.One kind of clue geologists are particularly keen on is isotopes. These are different forms of a particular element.Different isotopes of an element all behave the same in chemical reactions, but they contain different numbers of neutrons inside the atom. This makes some isotopes unstable: over time, they will radioactively decay into different elements.We can make use of this radioactive decay. For example, we can determine the age of the Yarrabubba crater and its surrounding rocks by measuring the ratio of uranium to lead isotopes, which acts like a stopwatch counting the time since a mineral has grown.This tells us the age because uranium decays into lead over time, and we know the rate at which this decay happens. So measuring the isotopes of both elements in a sample shows us how much decay has happened, allowing us to calculate the mineral's age.Another way to use isotopes is in certain minerals where these ratios remain fixed over time and do not change. The isotopic signatures then become a powerful tool to track where material has come from, in much the same way that a person's surname can give a clue to their family's origin.Messengers in a crystal bottleWe analyzed the isotopic compositions of lead in mineral grains from the crust surrounding the crater at Yarrabubba.We looked at crystals of feldspar, typically the pink-colored grains in our granite bench top example, as these naturally contain lead but no uranium.This is important as the lead isotopes trapped within this mineral reflect the composition of the liquid from which the mineral originally grew.We found a wide range of lead isotopic compositions, as well as new uranium-bearing minerals that grew within fractures in the grains at the time of the impact, starting new stopwatches.The only plausible explanation for these modifications of isotopic signatures is that the impact must have generated networks of circulating hot water that infiltrated damage zones throughout the rock. In the case of Yarrabubba, the water may well have come from the meteor hitting an ice sheet, as ice covered much of the world 2.29 billion years ago.The impacts of impactsOur documentation of the circulation of heated water produced by an impact is important from two very different perspectives.First, hot fluid systems may have nurtured early life. Impacts were much larger and more frequent on the early Earth, and in some ways these violent and disruptive events would have stood in the way of complex life evolving.Yet researchers have demonstrated that microbial communities can blossom where heat, water and nutrients meet pulverized rock: exactly the conditions impacts can produce. Some have even suggested impacts are a fundamental part of planetary evolution and necessary for creating a habitable planet.Second, seeing how impact-generated hot water can transport metals can help us understand how ore deposits are created. Some of the first sources of metal for early humans were meteorites, from which they chipped away bits of metal for tools and jewelry.Yet impact sites can contain larger concentrations of metals than just from the meteorite itself, which is often vaporized. Ore deposits typically form when there is a geological structure, for example a fracture within a rock, into which metals can be moved by fluids.Impacts clearly shatter the crust, but they also provide circulating hot water. If there is metal present in the target rocks to begin with, this hot water may carry and concentrate these metals into a richer deposit.

  "text": "An array of 350 radio telescopes in the Karoo desert of South Africa is getting closer to detecting the \"cosmic dawn\"\u2014the era after the Big Bang when stars first ignited and galaxies began to bloom.          A team of scientists from across North America, Europe, and South Africa has doubled the sensitivity of a radio telescope called the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA). With this breakthrough, they hope to peer into the secrets of the early universe.\"Over the last couple of decades, teams from around the world have worked towards a first detection of radio waves from the cosmic dawn. While such a detection remains elusive, HERA's results represent the most precise pursuit to date,\" says Adrian Liu, an Assistant Professor at the Department of Physics and the Trottier Space Institute at McGill University.The array was already the most sensitive radio telescope in the world dedicated to exploring the cosmic dawn. Now the HERA team has improved its sensitivity by a factor of 2.1 for radio waves emitted about 650 million years after the Big Bang and 2.6 for radio waves emitted about 450 million years after the Big Bang. Their work is described in a paper published in The Astrophysical Journal.Although the scientists have yet to detect radio emissions from the end of the cosmic dark ages, their results provide clues about the composition of stars and galaxies in the early universe. So far, their data suggest that early galaxies contained very few elements besides hydrogen and helium, unlike our galaxies today. Today's stars, have a variety of elements, ranging from lithium to uranium, that are heavier than helium.Ruling out some theoriesWhen the radio dishes are fully online and calibrated, the team hopes to construct a 3D map of the bubbles of ionized and neutral hydrogen\u2014markers for early galaxies\u2014as they evolved from about 200 million years to around 1 billion years after the Big Bang. The map could tell us how early stars and galaxies differed from those we see around us today, and how the universe looked in its adolescence, say the researchers.According to the researchers, the fact that the HERA team has not yet detected these signals rules out some theories of how stars evolved in the early universe. \"Our data suggest that early galaxies were about 100 times more luminous in X-rays than today's galaxies. The lore was that this would be the case, but now we have actual data that bolsters this hypothesis,\" says Liu.Waiting for a signalThe HERA team continues to improve the telescope's calibration and data analysis in hopes of seeing those bubbles in the early universe. However, filtering out the local radio noise to see the signals from the early universe has not been easy. \"If it's Swiss cheese, the galaxies make the holes, and we're looking for the cheese,\" says David DeBoer, a research astronomer in University of California Berkeley's Radio Astronomy Laboratory.\"HERA is continuing to improve and set better and better limits,\" says Aaron Parsons, principal investigator for HERA and a University of California Berkeley Associate Professor of astronomy. \"The fact that we're able to keep pushing through, and we have new techniques that are continuing to bear fruit for our telescope, is great.\" More information:The HERA Collaboration: Zara Abdurashidova et al, Improved Constraints on the 21 cm EoR Power Spectrum and the X-Ray Heating of the IGM with HERA Phase I Observations, The Astrophysical Journal (2023).

  "text": "Earth's water could have originated from interactions between the hydrogen-rich atmospheres and magma oceans of the planetary embryos that comprised Earth's formative years, according to new work from Carnegie Science's Anat Shahar and UCLA's Edward Young and Hilke Schlichting. Their findings, which could explain the origins of Earth's signature features, are published in Nature.          For decades, what researchers knew about planet formation was based primarily on our own solar system. Although there are some active debates about the formation of gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, it is widely agreed upon that Earth and the other rocky planets accreted from the disk of dust and gas that surrounded our sun in its youth.As increasingly larger objects crashed into each other, the baby planetesimals that eventually formed Earth grew both larger and hotter, melting into a vast magma ocean due to the heat of collisions and radioactive elements. Over time, as the planet cooled, the densest material sank inward, separating Earth into three distinct layers\u2014the metallic core, and the rocky, silicate mantle and crust.However, the explosion of exoplanet research over the past decade informed a new approach to modeling the Earth's embryonic state.\"Exoplanet discoveries have given us a much greater appreciation of how common it is for just-formed planets to be surrounded by atmospheres that are rich in molecular hydrogen, H2, during their first several million years of growth,\" Shahar explained. \"Eventually these hydrogen envelopes dissipate, but they leave their fingerprints on the young planet's composition.\"Using this information, the researchers developed new models for Earth's formation and evolution to see if our home planet's distinct chemical traits could be replicated.Using a newly developed model, the Carnegie and UCLA researchers were able to demonstrate that early in Earth's existence, interactions between the magma ocean and a molecular hydrogen proto-atmosphere could have given rise to some of Earth's signature features, such as its abundance of water and its overall oxidized state.The researchers used mathematical modeling to explore the exchange of materials between molecular hydrogen atmospheres and magma oceans by looking at 25 different compounds and 18 different types of reactions\u2014complex enough to yield valuable data about Earth's possible formative history, but simple enough to interpret fully.Interactions between the magma ocean and the atmosphere in their simulated baby Earth resulted in the movement of large masses of hydrogen into the metallic core, the oxidation of the mantle, and the production of large quantities of water.Even if all of the rocky material that collided to form the growing planet was completely dry, these interactions between the molecular hydrogen atmosphere and the magma ocean would generate copious amounts of water, the researchers revealed. Other water sources are possible, they say, but not necessary to explain Earth's current state.\"This is just one possible explanation for our planet's evolution, but one that would establish an important link between Earth's formation history and the most common exoplanets that have been discovered orbiting distant stars, which are called Super-Earths and sub-Neptunes,\" Shahar concluded.This project was part of the interdisciplinary, multi-institution AEThER project, initiated and led by Shahar, which seeks to reveal the chemical makeup of the Milky Way galaxy's most common planets\u2014Super-Earths and sub-Neptunes\u2014and to develop a framework for detecting signatures of life on distant worlds. This effort was developed to understand how the formation and evolution of these planets shape their atmospheres. This could\u2014in turn\u2014enable scientists to differentiate true biosignatures, which could only be produced by the presence of life, from atmospheric molecules of non-biological origin.\"Increasingly powerful telescopes are enabling astronomers to understand the compositions of exoplanet atmospheres in never-before-seen detail,\" Shahar said. \"AEThER's work will inform their observations with experimental and modeling data that, we hope, will lead to a foolproof method for detecting signs of life on other worlds.\" More information:Edward Young, Earth shaped by primordial H2 atmospheres, Nature (2023).

  "text": "After upgrading the radio telescope array at Westerbork, The Netherlands, astronomers have found five new fast radio bursts. The telescope images, much sharper than previously possible, revealed that multiple bursts had pierced our neighboring Triangulum galaxy. This allowed the astronomers to determine the maximum number of otherwise invisible atoms in this galaxy for the first time. The results are published on April 12 in Astronomy & Astrophysics.          Fast radio bursts, FRBs, are among the brightest explosions in the universe. The bursts mainly emit radio waves. The flashes are so powerful that radio telescopes can detect them even from over 4 billion light-years away. That continued visibility over such vast distances means the bursts contain immense amounts of energy. When it goes off, a single FRB contains ten trillion (ten million times a million) times the annual energy consumption of the entire world population.This gigantic energy generation makes FRBs highly interesting. Many astronomers think they are emitted by neutron stars. The density and magnetic field strength of those extremely compact stars are unique in the universe. By investigating the flashes, astronomers aim to better understand the fundamental properties of the matter that makes up the universe. But studying these flashes is difficult. No one knows where in the sky the next burst will go off. And an FRB lasts only a millisecond: if you blink, you will miss it.Powered by new receivers and a new supercomputer (the Apertif Radio Transient System, ARTS), Westerbork has now discovered five new FRBs. It also immediately pinpointed them, says principal investigator Joeri van Leeuwen (ASTRON), \"We now have an instrument with both a very wide field of view and very sharp vision. And all this live. That is new and exciting.\"Previously, radio telescopes such as Westerbork detected FRBs as with the compound eyes of a fly. Flies can see in all directions, but blurred. The Westerbork upgrade is like cross breeding the eyes of a fly with that of an eagle. The ARTS supercomputer continuously combines the images from twelve Westerbork dishes to create a sharp picture over a massive field of view.\"One cannot just go buy the complex electronics you need for this,\" says system architect Eric Kooistra (ASTRON). \"We designed most of the system ourselves, with a large team. That resulted in a state-of-the-art machine, one of the most powerful in the world.\"Credit: Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)Skewering galaxiesAstronomers want to understand how and why FRBs get to be so bright. But the flashes are also interesting because on their way to Earth they pierce other galaxies. Electrons in those galaxies, normally mostly invisible, distort the flashes. Tracking down invisible electrons, and their accompanying atoms, is important because most of the matter in the universe is dark and we still know little about it.Previously, radio telescopes could only roughly indicate where an FRB occurred. The ARTS supercomputer now enables Westerbork to indicate the exact location of an FRB very accurately. Van Leeuwen says, \"We demonstrated that three of the FRBs we discovered had skewered our neighbor, the Triangulum galaxy. We were thus able to count how many invisible electrons that galaxy contains at most, for the first time. A fantastic result.\" More information:Joeri van Leeuwen et al, The Apertif Radio Transient System (ARTS): Design, commissioning, data release, and detection of the first five fast radio bursts, Astronomy & Astrophysics (2023).

  "answer_squad": " LP 463-28",
  "text": "Using the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES) and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), astronomers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) have detected an M-dwarf companion to a nearby M-dwarf star designated G 68-34. The finding, published April 5 on the pre-print server arXiv, identifies G 68-34 a double-lined M-dwarf eclipsing binary.          Detached, double-lined, eclipsing spectroscopic binaries (DLEBs) are crucial for astronomers testing stellar models. This is due to the fact that the masses and radii of both stars can be directly measured from the light and radial velocity curves of the system.At a distance of some 127 light years from the Earth, G 68-34 is a nearby M dwarf, forming a widely separated (by 9 arcseconds) binary with a white dwarf known as LP 463-28. Previous observations of this white dwarf-M dwarf pair have found that G 68-34 rotates with a period of 0.655 days, and that the system is older than five billion years based on the white-dwarf cooling age.Given that G 68-34 has an anomalously rapid rotation, CfA's Emily K. Pass and David Charbonneau suppose that G 68-34 may be a close binary. They have recently obtained high-resolution spectra with TRES and photometry from TESS in order to verify this hypothesis.\"We observed G 68-34 with the TRES spectrograph on the 1.5m telescope at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO). We observed the star at eight epochs between September 2022 September and January 2023, with exposure times varying between 2,160 and 3,600 seconds depending on sky conditions. ... G 68-34 was observed at 2-minute cadence by TESS in its sector 56, which occurred in September 2022,\" the researchers wrote.The observations first confirmed that G 68-34 is indeed a double-lined spectroscopic binary. Furthermore, photometry from TESS revealed that the pair also eclipses, which makes it a double-lined eclipsing binary.By analyzing the collected data, it was found that G 68-34 is composed of two M dwarfs. The primary and secondary stars have radii of 0.345 and 0.342 solar radii, while their masses are 0.328 and 0.32 solar masses, respectively. The astronomers noted that G 68-34 is therefore a nearly equal-mass M-dwarf binary, with both components likely being fully convective.The age of the G 68-34 binary is yet to be determined. However, given that its widely separated white-dwarf primary LP 463-28 has a cooling age of five billion years, G 68-34 must be at least this old. The researchers added that it is necessary to find out how long LP 463-28 was on the main sequence in order to calculate the total age of G 68-34.Summing up the results, the authors of the paper estimate that the total age of G 68-34 is about 6.7 billion years. They concluded that galactic kinematics of this system suggests that it is part of the Galactic disk.

  "text": "Could vast, long-hidden oceans be teeming with alien life in our very own Solar System?          A new chapter in humanity's search for extraterrestrial life opens on Thursday as Europe's JUICE spacecraft blasts off on a mission to investigate the icy moons of Jupiter.First discovered by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei more than 400 years ago, these ice-covered moons are so far from the Sun that they were long dismissed as possible candidates to host life in our backyard.Until recently, the Solar System's habitable zone was thought to \"end at Mars\", French astrophysicist Athena Coustenis, one of the scientific leads of the European Space Agency (ESA)'s JUICE mission, told AFP.But NASA's Galileo probe to Jupiter in 1995 and the more recent Cassini spacecraft's trip to Saturn caused scientists to broaden their horizons.The gas giant planets themselves were correctly ruled out, but their icy moons\u2014particularly Jupiter's Europa and Ganymede, and Saturn's Enceladus and Titan\u2014offered fresh hope of nearby life.Under their icy surfaces are thought to be huge oceans of liquid water\u2014a crucial ingredient for life as we know it.Nicolas Altobelli, a JUICE project scientist at ESA, said it would be \"the first time that we explore habitats beyond the frost line\" between Mars and Jupiter.Beyond that line, temperatures plummet and \"liquid water can no longer exist on the surface\", Altobelli told AFP earlier this year.                Space probe JUICE to explore Jupiter and its icy moons.             'Gigantic' oceanThe Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission launches from Europe's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana on Thursday on an eight-year odyssey through space.By July 2031 it will have entered Jupiter's orbit, from which it will probe Ganymede, Europa and fellow icy moon Callisto.Then, in 2034, JUICE will enter the orbit of Ganymede, the first time a spacecraft has done so around a moon other than our own.As well as being the largest moon in the Solar System, Ganymede is also the only one that has its own magnetic field, which protects it from dangerous radiation.This is just one of several signs that Ganymede's hidden ocean could provide a stable environment for life.Unlike similar missions to Mars, which focus on finding signs of ancient life long since extinguished, scientists hope Jupiter's icy moons will still be home to living organisms, even if only tiny or single-celled.Such habitability requires a power source. Lacking energy from the Sun, the moons could instead take advantage of the gravity that Jupiter exerts on its satellites.                The moon Ganymede lurks behind the gas giant Jupiter in a Hubble telescope image from 2008.             The force creates a process called tidal heating, which warms the interior of the moons and keeps their water liquid.Ganymede's \"gigantic\" liquid ocean is trapped between two thick layers of ice dozens of kilometers beneath the surface, said Carole Larigauderie, JUICE project head at French space agency CNES.\"On Earth, we still find life forms at the bottom of the abyss,\" she added.Tiny microbes such as bacteria and archaea have been found to be able to survive on Earth without sunlight, raising hopes that life elsewhere will be able to do the same.As well as water and energy, life needs nutrients.\"The big question is therefore whether Ganymede's ocean contains\" the necessary chemical elements, Coustenis said.The ocean would need to be able to absorb the nutrients from anything that fell on the moon's surface, for example, which would eventually dissolve into the water, she added.                The ESA's JUICE spacecraft will become the first to enter the orbit of a moon other than Earth's own.             Not aloneJUICE's array of instruments will probe Ganymede's ocean to determine its depth, distance from the surface and\u2014hopefully\u2014its composition.The ESA's 1.6 billion euro ($1.7 billion) probe will spend eight months orbiting Ganymede, getting as close as 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the moon, all while sheltered from radiation.It will not be the only spacecraft lurking around Jupiter.NASA's Europa Clipper mission is scheduled to launch in October next year. It will take a quicker path to Jupiter, arriving at Europa in 2030.If one\u2014or more\u2014of Jupiter's moons ticks all the boxes to host life, the \"logical next step\" would be to send a mission to land on the surface, said Cyril Cavel, JUICE project manager at manufacturer Airbus.Although there are no plans for such a mission, which could definitively prove the existence of life outside of Earth, \"that's part of the dream,\" he said.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Search for alien life extends to Jupiter's icy moons (2023, April 12)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-alien-life-jupiter-icy-moons.html  This document is subject to copyright.

The facility, created for three planned experiments called the Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog (CHAPEA), is located at the US space agency's massive research base in Houston, Texas.Four volunteers will begin the first trial this summer, during which NASA plans to monitor their physical and mental health to better understand humans' fortitude for such a long isolation.With that data, NASA will better understand astronauts' \"resource use\" on Mars, said Grace Douglas, lead researcher on the CHAPEA experiments.\"We can really start to understand how we're supporting them with what we're providing them, and that's going to be really important information to making those critical resource decisions,\" she said on a press tour of the habitat.Such a distant mission comes with \"very strict mass limitations,\" she added.The volunteers will live inside a 1,700 square-foot (160 square-meter) home, dubbed \"Mars Dune Alpha,\" which includes two bathrooms, a vertical farm to grow salad, a room dedicated to medical care, an area for relaxing and several workstations.

First, as the aging star began its death process, it consumed heavier and heavier fuels in its core. That heated it up and the star expanded. It also ejected clouds of warm dust. They expanded slowly outward from the event. Then, when the star's core began to consume iron, it took more energy than the star could supply. Burning stopped and the core collapsed. That brought the rest of the star inward. Then, it all rebounded, sending tendrils of stellar material racing away from the core. Eventually, that material collided with the slower-expanding dust shell.All the colors in the image indicate the various parts of the explosion. The scene is pretty confusing at first. Astronomers are still working to figure out all the different sources of emissions in the remnant. The orange and red-hued material indicates emission from the warm outer shell. The tendrils are the starstuff rushing away from the collapsed core. They are bright pink and studded with knots and clumps. There's a mix of elements generated in the star and by the explosion\u2014including oxygen, neon, and argon. There is a collection of wispy star material closer to the center of the explosion site. The most prominent is a giant green loop that the team nicknamed the \"Green Monster.\" It's an unexpected feature and nobody's quite sure how or why it formed.                Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is a supernova remnant. It has been observed many times. This new image uses data from Webb\u2019s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) to reveal Cas A in a new light.

DePasquale (STScI)             The Cas A supernova remnant and cosmic dustSupernovae scatter huge amounts of dust in their wakes. So, this raises a question. Since astronomers see dusty galaxies in the early universe, did supernovae make them that way? The answer is complicated. Certainly, the first supermassive stars existed pretty early in cosmic history. And, they died in supernova explosions. So, it might make sense to assume that they'd scatter dust as they died. Yet, observations of more \"modern\" supernovae and their dust output don't always explain the huge amounts of dust in early times. So, where did the early dust come from, if not from supernovae?The answer may be that they did provide all that dust. We just need the high-resolution infrared views that JWST is able to provide to find the evidence for that. \"In Cas A, we can spatially resolve regions that have different gas compositions and look at what types of dust were formed in those regions,\" said Temim. That means JWST can \"see\" what astronomers haven't been able to detect using many other telescopes in the past.Exploring supernova remnants like Cas A gives astronomers more than a view of what a dying star does to its environment. Doing it in high-resolution detailed infrared views allows astronomers to \"see inside\" dusty objects such as Cas A. Not only that, but it provides a window to the past. \"By understanding the process of exploding stars, we're reading our own origin story,\" said Milisavljevic. \"I'm going to spend the rest of my career trying to understand what's in this data set.\"                This Chandra X-ray Observatory image of Cas A shows chemical elements in the supernova remnant. The different colors mostly represent iron (orange), oxygen (purple), and the amount of silicon compared to magnesium (green). Titanium (light blue) detected previously by NASA\u2019s NuSTAR telescope at higher\u00a0X-ray\u00a0energies is also shown. These Chandra and NuSTAR X-ray data have been overlaid on an\u00a0optical-light\u00a0image from the Hubble Space Telescope (yellow). Credit: Chandra: NASA/CXC/RIKEN/T. Sato et al.; NuSTAR: NASA/NuSTAR; Hubble: NASA/STScI             Past views of supernova remant of Cas ACassiopeia A lies only about 11,000 light-years from us and stretches across 10 light-years of space. It was probably first observed in the late 1600s from Earth. With the advent of modern telescopes, it has been seen in visible light from the ground, as well as through radio observations, and from space by the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, NuSTAR, and others.This lopsided stellar remnant itself is speeding out from the explosion site at a velocity between 4,000 and 6,000 kilometers per second. HST images showed knots and other ejecta moving away at up to 14,500 kilometers per second. Spitzer Space Telescope and the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (both predecessors to JWST) detected an infrared echo from the explosion on nearby gas clouds.All of these observations point to Cas A being a perfect target for further studies of supernova explosions and their role throughout cosmic time.

  "text": "All stars are born from the collapse of clouds of dust and gas. But triggering star formation is a tricky process, because these gas clouds can just hang out doing nothing for billions of years. A pair of researchers have found a precise recipe for getting gas clouds to trigger star formation. It involves a lot of collision.          When clouds of gas collide, several things happen at once. The gas and dust tangle up on each other and immediately trigger turbulent ripples that race throughout the newly merged clump. Shockwaves can also form, which travel at their own speed through the chaos. In all of the mess pockets of the cloud can destabilize. When they do, they pinch off from the rest of the cloud and quickly collapse as the gravitational force within them overwhelms any other form of support.When that happens, clusters of stars form. Astronomers have long suspected this story to be true, but it but mysteries remain as to the details of how a cloud of gas transforms into stars. And so a pair of researchers investigated this in detail. They studied how the sizes and velocities of clumps of gas lead to different rates of star formation.They found that the largest influence on star formation was not the properties of the gas clouds themselves but on the background they find themselves in. For example, if two gas clouds merge together in an environment that has a relatively high density, then the gas clumps tend to produce more compact merger remnants. This leads to fewer but more massive stars. Conversely, if the gas clouds are relatively isolated, they produce more numerous but less massive stars.This is just one piece of the larger puzzle of trying to understand the history of star formation and under what conditions what kind of stars our galaxy produces.The research is published on the arXiv preprint server.

  "answer_squad": " Gaia",
  "text": "Some of the most exciting things that happen in a telescope's lifetime are its data releases. Gaia, which has been operating since 2013, recently released its third major dataset, and astronomers that weren't intimately involved in the operation and planning for the project have had some time to pull over. Their studies are starting to pop up in journals everywhere.          For example, a new one from a research team, mainly from Guangzhou University, catalogs more than 1,100 new star clusters, significantly increasing the overall total of these critical components in the structure of the Milky Way. The full paper is available on the arXiv preprint server.There has long been a disconnect between the estimated number of star clusters (or open clusters) in the Milky Way and their observed total. Around 15 years ago, researchers thought there would be as many as 100,000 open clusters in the Milky Way based on observed structures in the formation of the galaxy.Actual observational evidence for that many clusters was lacking, though. Gaia, which focuses on cataloging an astronomical 1.7 billion stars in our galaxy, has already been a source of a large percentage of the 7,000 or so that have already been found. Before the first Gaia release, only 1,200 open clusters were known. Data release two found an additional 4,000, while previous work with the third data release found an additional 1,600.Most of those previous findings had a weakness, though\u2014they looked primarily at the central galactic plane, with a \"galactic latitude,\" as the paper calls it, of less than 20 degrees. Only open clusters on the main galactic plane would be visible in that dataset.So the researchers from Guangzhou took a different approach\u2014they analyzed Gaia data that went well above the 20 degrees previously studied. In addition, they looked out about as far as they could go in the Gaia data\u2014about 5 kiloparsecs or a little more than 16,000 light years.They then had to find a way to sort through all that data. For that, they turned to a series of algorithms akin to simplistic AI learning models. Those include an unsupervised clustering algorithm\u2014basically a way to lump similar data sets together. They also used a Random Forest binary classification system, which tries to construct a valid way to categorize previously unstructured data by using a training input (in this case, the output of the clustering algorithm).Since the number of potential findings was still semi-manageable (at least for hard-working graduated students), the team also visually confirmed each of the 1,179 clusters they found in the data. Once confirmed, the team worked to classify some of their more important characteristics, such as the metallicity and age of their stars.Results from their work move astronomers closer to confirming the theory about the total number of open clusters in the galaxy. And while 16,000 light-years might seem far (given that it would take light more than twice the time of all of history to travel it), it's a relative drop in the bucket compared to the overall size of the Milky Way. There are surely plenty of other open clusters left to find, and hopefully, there will be plenty more data releases from both Gaia and its successors to help find them.

  "text": "A pair of Earth, atmospheric and planetary scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology has shown how the magnetic field of a meteorite can be damaged by amateur collectors using hand magnets. In their paper published in Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, Foteini Vervelidou and Benjamin Weiss describe how they tested the impact on the magnetic field of terrestrial basalt\u2014as a stand in for meteorites\u2014when it is exposed to hand magnets and what they learned by doing so.          Back in 2011, nomads in the Sahara Desert came across dark black chunks of rock atop a field of sand. Suspecting they might be valuable, they collected them and brought them to town for trade. Eventually, the rocks attracted the attention of local scientists who purchased them and brought them to a lab for testing.That testing showed the rocks to be chunks of a meteorite that has come to be known as \"Black Beauty.\" Testing also showed that crystals inside of the meteorite had formed on Mars, approximately 4.4. billion years ago. Unfortunately, testing of its magnetic field showed that it had been wiped away and replaced with a stronger signal\u2014the result of testing done by amateurs with a hand magnet.Magnetic field disruption in meteorites had been seen before, and it has been seen many times since Black Beauty was found, but until now, no one has taken the time to actively study the process. In this new effort, that is what the research pair have done\u2014using terrestrial basalt as a stand-in for meteorites.In testing the impact of a hand magnet on 13 samples, which the research pair note, are typically made of rare-earth metals, they found that moving them to within inches of basalt samples led to magnetic fields in the rocks being irretrievably erased and replaced by the magnetic field of the hand magnetic.They note doing so is similar to placing a strong magnet near a computer hard drive\u2014all the data is erased. But they also found that magnet disruption was progressive and that allowed them to create a guide for researchers looking to study meteorites in the future, letting them know how deep they would have to cut into a meteorite to reach a pristine sample. The pair also relate how the loss of magnetic field data from Black Beauty was particularly devastating because it could have provided clues about the magnetic field on Mars that once shielded its atmosphere from depletion.The research pair conclude their paper by asking that people who find meteorites not use magnets on them. If they think a rock might be valuable, they suggest having it tested by a professional.

  "answer_squad": " SMSS J0313\u20136708",
  "text": "By analyzing the data from various astronomical surveys, astronomers have detected 188,002 candidate metal-poor stars. The discovery, reported in a research paper published March 30 on the arXiv pre-print server, may help us better understand how the universe chemically evolved.          Metal-poor stars are rare objects as only a few thousands of stars with iron abundances [Fe/H] below -2 have been discovered so far. Currently, SMSS J0313\u20136708, with metallicity below -7.3, is the most metal-poor star known to date.Astronomers are interested in expanding the still short list of metal-poor stars as such objects have the potential to improve our knowledge of the chemical evolution of the universe. The early evolution of the universe is believed to be dependent on the properties of the first generation of metal-free stars.Recently, low-resolution blue and red photometer spectra (BP/RP or XP spectra) for 210 million stars have been published with the Data Release 3 (DR3) from ESA's Gaia satellite. A team of astronomers led by Yupeng Yao of the University of Chicago decided to comb through this dataset, which provides an opportunity to greatly increase the number of candidate metal-poor stars. Their study was complemented by data from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) survey and from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE).\"In this work, we train XGBoost models to identify metal-poor stars in Gaia DR3. The input to the models are the coefficients of normalized and dereddened XP spectra. ... We utilize the coefficients of normalized and dereddened XP spectra together with their corresponding [Fe/H] from LAMOST or APOGEE to compose training and testing sets to train the XGBoost model to identify metal-poor stars in Gaia DR3,\" the researchers explained.XGBoost is a powerful and flexible algorithm that has been utilized in a variety of sub-fields of astrophysics. By employing the XGBoost classification algorithm, the astronomers obtained three corresponding candidate metal-poor star catalogs.All in all, the team managed to identify 127,096 bright and 60,906 faint candidate metal-poor stars in the Milky Way galaxy. The researchers noted that the total number of candidate metal-poor stars they obtained is around an order of magnitude larger than that from previous studies.According to the paper, Galactic bulge and halo stars are the dominant objects in the whole sample. The astronomers estimate that about 84,200 stars out of the 188,002 identified candidates are expected to be genuine metal-poor stars, which represents an overall purity of 45%.The authors of the study expect that about 600 stars of the assumed 84,200 genuine metal-poor stars are extremely metal-deficient, with metallicities below -3.5. They calculated that the other 2,800 stars should have metallicities between -3.5 and -3.0.

  "text": "More and more miniature satellites are being launched every year, driving up demand for smaller rockets.          Contemporary life would hardly be possible without satellites. Much of what people do on Earth today relies heavily on what's happening high above their heads\u2014from monitoring wildfires, deforestation and sea-surface temperatures to enabling connections to new mobile technologies like 5G in hard-to-reach areas.A recent wave of cheaper, miniature satellites being sent into low orbits of 500 to 1,000 kilometers above Earth by the likes of Elon Musk's SpaceX and UK-based OneWeb signals a growing trend.Less is moreWith some tracking the globe's whole landmass and providing unprecedented detail, these satellites can be the size of a shoebox or even smaller. More than 2,500 of them are expected to be launched each year on average over the next decade.To reach space economically, small satellites often need to rideshare on large rockets. Developing smaller rockets could allow faster, more personalized access to space, opening up the market to a wider range of specialist providers.\"Small satellites can travel on big launch vehicles, but there are problems like time to orbit because you need to book a slot far in advance and going exactly where your satellites need to go,\" said Xavier Llair\u00f3, chief commercial officer and co-founder of Pangea Aerospace in Barcelona, Spain. \"The companies launching these, need tailored access to space.\"The RRTB project led by Pangea has been investigating cost-effective ways to put small rockets that can carry up to 500 kilograms of cargo into space. The hope is to have an engine ready for flight by 2025.The key is to find ways to reuse these microlaunchers by minimizing the impact they undergo on re-entry into Earth's atmosphere and by enabling them to land safely. This would also be more environmentally friendly than using launchers just once.\"Through reuse, you can lower investment, use fewer production means and have higher launch frequency,\" said Llair\u00f3.At the moment, Europe lacks a proven method for doing this, according to RRTB, which ends this month after three years.      First sectionRRTB has focused on reusing the first section\u2014or stage\u2014of the rocket, located at its base. This section provides most of the thrust straight after launch, before detaching and falling back to Earth, often into the ocean. With a lighter load, the rocket's other stages press on to take their cargo into orbit.But the first stage can be damaged during its high-speed descent back through Earth's atmosphere and also by seawater. The difficulties and costs of retrieving and returning the rocket to the launch site may be more trouble than it's worth.\"When they fall into the sea, it makes reusability very, very hard,\" said Llair\u00f3.The answer is to find a way for the first stage to re-enter Earth's atmosphere safely and land at a docking base near the launch site or on a floating barge, according to Llair\u00f3.At the same time, the design of the rocket needs to allow it to carry a payload big enough to make the operation economically viable.To find ways to reduce the damage to micro-launchers during re-entry into Earth's atmosphere and landing, the RRTB team has tested a scaled-down model of a small rocket in a wind tunnel.The ideal goal for smaller launchers, according to Llair\u00f3, is to avoid the engines firing up for re-entry. That would allow launchers to transport a larger initial payload by reducing the weight of fuel they need to carry.New nozzleThe team struggled when the rocket had a traditional bell-shaped nozzle around its engine, but found more promise with a cone shape. This \"aerospike\" nozzle helps spread heat in a way that lessens the pummeled the vehicle takes.\"It makes it smoother to penetrate the atmosphere,\" said Llair\u00f3. \"This is not only valid for small launch vehicles but also for larger ones. It was an unexpected finding because we were not initially looking for this.\"While aerospikes also burn less fuel than conventional engines, Llair\u00f3 said these benefits until now have been offset by the complexities and costs in engineering them, including difficulties with cooling. Nonetheless, techniques like 3D printing\u2014which is being harnessed by Pangea\u2014are making them more viable.\"Aerospike technology will change how we access space and how we come back to Earth,\" said Llair\u00f3. \"It is a major enabler for rocket reusability.\"Meanwhile, he said, the engine that the team plans to use will rely on bio-sourced methane as a propellant.The quest is also on to make individual rocket parts more reusable, for example with aluminum-based material for the fuel tanks.\"You need to land most rockets safely and reuse as many of their components as possible to make things economically viable,\" said Llair\u00f3.Primed for launchWhile RRTB has focused on rocket reusability, aerospace company Orbex in the UK is preparing to debut its own lightweight, eco friendly, microlauncher.Under the PRIME project, Orbex in May last year unveiled a prototype of its 19-meter-long rocket\u2014set to be Europe's first full-orbital microlauncher for small satellites.The rocket is also designed to be reusable through recovery of parts that don't burn up in the atmosphere. While the firm is not yet revealing how it will do this, a spokesperson for Orbex said the method would be \"completely novel.\"The company hopes the Prime rocket can undertake its first launch this year, pending certain prerequisites including the granting of a launch license.\"We have already sold a number of launch slots to commercial satellite providers, but have yet to announce the date of our inaugural launch,\" said Orbex Chief Executive Officer Chris Larmour. He was also coordinator of PRIME, which ran for three years through June 2022.Greener rocketThe rocket will use clean biopropane fuel formed as an additional product in the creation of biodiesel, which is made from sources like waste vegetable oils and used cooking oil.This will be combined with liquid oxygen, a \"cryogenic propellant\"\u2014a gas chilled to sub-freezing temperature and condensed into highly combustible liquid.Through these measures, the rocket could lower carbon emissions by up to 96% compared with similar-sized fossil-fuel-powered launch vehicles.\"Orbex Prime is set to be the world's most environmentally friendly space rocket, powered by a renewable biofuel,\" said Larmour.The fuel tanks are made from carbon fiber, which combines high strength with low weight.Orbex estimates that Prime weighs about 30% less than traditional launchers, enabling the type of higher efficiency and performance crucial for small satellites. Furthermore, the rocket is designed to leave zero debris on Earth and in orbit.At its spaceport in Sutherland on Scotland's northern coast, the company expects to be able to launch up to 12 rockets a year. The port is also expected to be carbon-neutral in its construction and operation.Its relative proximity to Glasgow will help capitalize on the area's burgeoning space industry, with the city producing more satellites than anywhere else in Europe. Orbex believes this will offer the right setup to help the region's players get airborne.\"The satellite industry and its requirement for launchers that can put satellites into specific orbits has grown in recent years and continues to grow exponentially,\" said Larmour. \"This creates a huge demand for dedicated and sustainable launches.\" More information: RRTB  PRIME Provided byHorizon: The EU Research & Innovation MagazineCitation:In booming satellite market, micro-rockets are the next big thing (2023, April 11)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-booming-satellite-micro-rockets-big.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "For millennia, humans have been fascinated by the mysteries of the cosmos.          Unlike ancient philosophers imagining the universe's origins, modern cosmologists use quantitative tools to gain insights into the universe's evolution and structure. Modern cosmology dates back to the early 20th century, with the development of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity.Now, researchers from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration have created a groundbreaking new image that reveals the most detailed map of dark matter distributed across a quarter of the entire sky, extending deep into the cosmos. What's more, it confirms Einstein's theory of how massive structures grow and bend light, over the entire 14-billion-year life span of the universe.\"We have mapped the invisible dark matter across the sky to the largest distances, and clearly see features of this invisible world that are hundreds of millions of light-years across,\" says Blake Sherwin, professor of cosmology at the University of Cambridge, where he leads a group of ACT researchers. \"It looks just as our theories predict.\"                The Atacama Cosmology Telescope in Northern Chile, supported by the National Science Foundation, operated from 2007\u20132022.

Credit: Mark Devlin, Deputy Director of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the Reese Flower Professor of Astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania             Despite making up 85% of the universe and influencing its evolution, dark matter has been hard to detect because it doesn't interact with light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation. As far as we know dark matter only interacts with gravity.To track it down, the more than 160 collaborators who have built and gathered data from the National Science Foundation's Atacama Cosmology Telescope in the high Chilean Andes observe light emanating following the dawn of the universe's formation, the Big Bang\u2014when the universe was only 380,000 years old. Cosmologists often refer to this diffuse light that fills our entire universe as the \"baby picture of the universe,\" but formally, it is known as the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB).The team tracks how the gravitational pull of large, heavy structures including dark matter warps the CMB on its 14-billion-year journey to us, like how a magnifying glass bends light as it passes through its lens.      \"We've made a new mass map using distortions of light left over from the Big Bang,\" says Mathew Madhavacheril, assistant professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania. \"Remarkably, it provides measurements that show that both the 'lumpiness' of the universe, and the rate at which it is growing after 14 billion years of evolution, are just what you'd expect from our standard model of cosmology based on Einstein's theory of gravity.\"                Research by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaboration has culminated in a groundbreaking new map of dark matter distributed across a quarter of the entire sky, reaching deep into the cosmos. Findings provide further support to Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity, which has been the foundation of the standard model of cosmology for more than a century, and offer new methods to demystify dark matter. Credit: Debra Kellner             Sherwin adds, \"our results also provide new insights into an ongoing debate some have called 'The Crisis in Cosmology,'\" explaining that this crisis stems from recent measurements that use a different background light, one emitted from stars in galaxies rather than the CMB. These have produced results that suggest the dark matter was not lumpy enough under the standard model of cosmology and led to concerns that the model may be broken. However, the team's latest results from ACT were able to precisely assess that the vast lumps seen in this image are the exact right size.\"When I first saw them, our measurements were in such good agreement with the underlying theory that it took me a moment to process the results,\" says Cambridge Ph.D. student Frank Qu, part of the research team. \"It will be interesting to see how this possible discrepancy between different measurements will be resolved.\"\"The CMB lensing data rivals more conventional surveys of the visible light from galaxies in their ability to trace the sum of what is out there,\" says Suzanne Staggs, director of ACT and Henry DeWolf Smyth Professor of Physics at Princeton University. \"Together, the CMB lensing and the best optical surveys are clarifying the evolution of all the mass in the universe.\"\"When we proposed this experiment in 2003, we had no idea the full extent of information that could be extracted from our telescope,\" says Mark Devlin, the Reese Flower Professor of Astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania and the deputy director of ACT. \"We owe this to the cleverness of the theorists, the many people who built new instruments to make our telescope more sensitive, and the new analysis techniques our team came up with.\"                Research by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaboration has culminated in a groundbreaking new map of dark matter distributed across a quarter of the entire sky, reaching deep into the cosmos.

  "text": "South Korea plans to conduct its first launch of a commercial-grade satellite aboard a domestically built rocket next month as part of its space development program, officials said Tuesday.          South Korea's officials say its homegrown Nuri space launch vehicle has no military purposes. But some experts say the development of such rockets would eventually help the country acquire technologies needed to build bigger missiles and launch reconnaissance satellites amid animosities with rival North Korea.In June last year, South Korea conducted its first satellite launch using the Nuri rocket. That launch involved what South Korean officials called a \"performance verification\" satellite mainly designed to examine the capacity of the rocket while next month's event is meant to put a commercial-grade satellite into orbit for the first time.The Science Ministry said the rocket will blast off from the country's space launch center on a southern island on May 24. A ministry statement said it had set a backup launch date from May 25-31, in case of possible schedule changes due to weather.The rocket will carry one main satellite called \"Next Generation Small Satellite 2\" and seven other smaller cube-shaped satellites. The main satellite is tasked with verifying imaging radar technology and observing cosmic radiation in near-Earth orbit, the statement said.                In this photo released by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, the Nuri rocket is seen at the Naro Space Center in Goheung, South Korea, on March 28, 2023. South Korea plans to conduct its first launch of a commercial-grade satellite aboard a domestically built rocket next month as part of its space development program, officials said Tuesday, April 11. Credit: Korea Aerospace Research Institute via AP             Authorities have completed the assembly of the rocket's first and second stages and are conducting final environmental tests of the eight satellites that are to be placed on the rocket's third stage.Last year's launch was the Nuri rocket's second liftoff. In its first launch in 2021, the rocket's dummy payload reached the desired altitude but failed to enter orbit. After next month's launch, South Korea plans three more Nuri rocket launches, officials said.\"The third launch of Nuri is of great significance as it is the first attempt to launch a commercial-grade satellite and the first time a private company will jointly manufacture the homegrown Nuri rocket,\" Oh Tae-seok, the first vice science minister, was quoted as saying in the ministry statement.South Korea, the world's 10th largest economy, is a major producer of semiconductors, automobiles and smartphones. But its space development program lags behind that of its neighbors China, India and Japan. Since the early 1990s, South Korea has sent a series of satellites into space, but all of them involved foreign rocket technology or launch sites.North Korea placed Earth observation satellites into orbit in 2012 and 2016, but there is no proof that either satellite has been functioning. North Korea was slapped with international sanctions because of the two launches because the U.N. views them as disguised tests of the North's banned long-range missile technology.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

  "answer_squad": " James Webb Space telescope",
  "text": "The massive Kepler survey found a treasure trove of exoplanets. But in all that wealth they found three anomalies: what appeared to be rings of dust surrounding stars where planets should be. They were rocky planets in the process of being obliterated. And a team of astronomers that found a way to use these gory sites to understand some of the most mysterious and hard to detect planets in the universe.          We currently know of about 5,000 exoplanets in the galaxy. This represents only a small fraction of the estimated 1 trillion worlds within the Milky Way. But even though we've made great strides, we have exceptional difficulty finding one particular class of exoplanet: the small, rocky ones. Our techniques rely on transits.When an exoplanet crosses in front of the face of the star, it causes a small dip in brightness from our point of view. But if the planet is too small, the change in brightness isn't large enough for us to detect, and so the small planets, roughly the size of the Earth and smaller, remain hidden from us.But recently a team of researchers pointed out that some anomalies in the Kepler data may be a blessing in disguise. Among the data returned from Kepler includes what appears to be rings of dust and debris surrounding a star. Previous researchers had concluded that these are rocky planets in the process of obliteration. They are worlds that got too close to their parent star, and the heat of that star is boiling them alive.Credit: Universe TodayThe team of researchers released a paper, available on the arXiv preprint sever, detailing simulations of how this process could unfold. They found that these small worlds are caught between two extremes. Because they orbit closely to their parent star, they are almost certainly tidally locked, which means that only one side of the planet faces the star at all times. The other side is permanently locked in night. The day side gets blasted to such a degree that instead of a crust it just has a thin shell of pure magma. But the other side is so cold that the rocky crust remains in place.The night side cools down the planet while the day side heats it up. The astronomers found that there is only a very narrow window where we can observe such situations. If a planet is too big or the star is not bright enough, then it does not evaporate enough material for us to detect it in something like Kepler. However if the planet is too small or the star is too intense, the entire planet obliterates in a short enough time that we are unlikely to see it in a random sample of stars.Only certain special cases can lead to a ring of debris large enough and visible enough for us to see it. Going from this the astronomers estimate that for every star in the galaxy there is roughly one planet the size of the Earth or smaller.Additionally, the astronomers found that these debris trails can give us very important clues as to rocky planetary formation. We don't normally get to crack open planets and see what's inside of them. But in these cases the parent star is doing the job for us. They advocate for a follow-up observations with the James Webb Space telescope to study these systems in detail to understand what these rocky planets were made of.

  "question_squad": " What is the term for the band around a star where liquid water can potentially exist?",
  "answer_squad": " habitable zones",
  "text": "Astronomers are currently searching for signs of life in the \"habitable zones\" of nearby stars, which is defined as the band around a star where liquid water can potentially exist. But a recent paper argues that we need to take a more nuanced and careful approach, based not on the potential for life, but the potential for computation.          One way to define life itself is as a set of computations that act on information. The information is stored in DNA and the computations are performed by various proteins. The ability to store information and act on its environment allows life to undergo natural selection, which finds ever more complex arrangements.The traditional searches for life look at how we understand it from an earthly context. Namely, creatures living on the surface of a world just the right distance from a parent star and using liquid water as a solvent for chemical reactions. But it's easy to imagine much more complex and varied forms of life out there in the universe. Life could use other solvents.Life could be buried underground in icy outer moons. Life may not even require a star. And biological systems could give rise to technological systems that would not meet our current definition for life but might be alive in their own way.And so a pair of researchers want to rebuild the concept of the habitable zone using a more fundamental concept of computation. They argue that the best chances of finding signs of life are where there is easiest access to computation. The researchers argue that these so-called \"computational zones\" require three characteristics. One, there must be the capacity for computation, which means that there is a rich set of chemistry available. Two, there must be a raw form of energy, like sunlight or hydrothermal vents. And lastly, computation requires a substrate\u2014something in which the computation can take place.The traditional view of habitable zones can now be seen as a subset of a much larger concept of computational zones. Where there is life as we currently understand it here on Earth there is computation taking place. But this framework allows us to develop search strategies for concepts of life extending beyond that. For example, if we study individual systems through a lens of computational ability, we might find which systems might be amenable to artificial energy gathering structures like Dyson spheres.Or we could examine how gas clouds around sub-stellar structures could meet all the conditions necessary for computation, and therefore the conditions necessary for a broadened definition of life.The search for life in our universe in a scientific way has only just begun. And it's important, as the authors emphasize, to keep an open mind.The paper is published on the arXiv preprint server.

  "answer_squad": " resonance",
  "text": "Researchers have discovered that in the exotic conditions of the early universe, waves of gravity may have shaken space-time so hard that they spontaneously created radiation.          The physical concept of resonance surrounds us in everyday life. When you're sitting on a swing and want to go higher, you naturally start pumping your legs back and forth. You very quickly find the exact right rhythm to make the swing go higher. If you go off rhythm then the swing stops going higher. This particular kind of phenomenon is known in physics as a parametric resonance.Your legs act as an external pumping mechanism. When they match the resonant frequency of the system, in this case your body sitting on a swing, they are able to transfer energy to the system making the swing go higher.These kinds of resonances happen all over the place, and a team of researchers have discovered that an exotic form of parametric resonance may have even occurred in the extremely early universe.Perhaps the most dramatic event to occur in the entire history of the universe was inflation. This is a hypothetical event that took place when our universe was less than a second old. During inflation our cosmos swelled to dramatic proportions, becoming many orders of magnitude larger than it was before. The end of inflation was a very messy business, as gravitational waves sloshed back and forth throughout the cosmos.Normally gravitational waves are exceedingly weak. We have to build detectors that are capable of measuring distances less than the width of an atomic nucleus to find gravitational waves passing through the Earth. But researchers have pointed out that in the extremely early universe these gravitational waves may have become very strong.And they may have even created standing wave patterns where the gravitational waves weren't traveling but the waves stood still, almost frozen in place throughout the cosmos. Since gravitational waves are literally waves of gravity, the places where the waves are the strongest represent an exceptional amount of gravitational energy.The researchers found that this could have major consequences for the electromagnetic field existing in the early universe at that time. The regions of intense gravity may have excited the electromagnetic field enough to release some of its energy in the form of radiation, creating light.This result gives rise to an entirely new phenomenon: the production of light from gravity alone. There's no situation in the present-day universe that could allow this process to happen, but the researchers have shown that the early universe was a far stranger place than we could possibly imagine.

  "text": "Astronauts aboard the International Space Station are hard at work on research guided by students and researchers from the University of Colorado Boulder.          Two cardiovascular tissue experiments were launched to the ISS aboard SpaceX CRS-27 on March 15, 2023, and CU Boulder's BioServe Space Technologies developed the hardware for both. The research stems from National Institutes of Health grants led by Stanford University and Johns Hopkins University.\"When astronauts go to space it can have negative impact on their cardiovascular systems,\" said Stefanie Countryman, director of BioServe. \"Our organs evolved to work here on Earth so they function differently in space. The goal with both of these projects is to better understand how these treatments impact cardiovascular issues in Earth bound people and to advance treatments that could be provided to astronauts before launch or while in space.\"BioServe has been designing, building, and flying microgravity life science research experiments and hardware since 1987. Government space agencies, universities, and private companies like SpaceX frequently contract with BioServe to take advantage of the center's longstanding experience in space research.The two experiments launched on March 15 include specialized hardware developed by BioServe specifically for these projects and will also utilize BioServe's Space Automated Bioproduct Lab, an orbiting incubator that has been in use on ISS since 2015.Past heart studies have shown that just four weeks of microgravity exposure causes significant changes in cell function and gene expression that could lead to long-term damage or cardiac muscle atrophy.                One of the experiments and its enclosure before launch here on Earth. Credit: University of Colorado at Boulder             The Stanford experiment utilizes simplified heart tissues to test pharmaceuticals that could reduce microgravity-induced changes in heart cell function. Meanwhile the Johns Hopkins project aims to study human cardiomyocyte functional performance and the potential of specific therapeutics to prevent negative impacts.While both projects are intended to help astronauts in space, the research could eventually also improve life for people here on Earth suffering from heart conditions due to aging or abnormalities that lead to a weakening of the heart muscle.      \"Being able to design the hardware to support research like this for cell cultures and tissue engineering is very specialized,\" Countryman said.In addition to the hardware development, BioServe also conducts live uplinks with astronauts to walk them through the experiments. As both a research facility and educational center, BioServe employs full time staff and students to advance their work.\"Undergrad and grad students are responsible for assembly of hardware and kit design and helping during uplinks with the crew. Students are an integral part of operations,\" Countryman said.The one downside to working with astronauts is frequent late nights. ISS astronauts live and work on Coordinated Universal Time, so the crew day begins at 1:30 a.m. Colorado time. That means uplinks frequently occur long after most Americans have gone to sleep.\"It's a small price to pay to work with people in space,\" Countryman said.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the neutron star that is drawing material away from a nearby star?",
  "answer_squad": " Hercules X-1",
  "text": "An accretion disk is a colossal whirlpool of gas and dust that gathers around a black hole or a neutron star like cotton candy as it pulls in material from a nearby star. As the disk spins, it whips up powerful winds that push and pull on the sprawling, rotating plasma. These massive outflows can affect the surroundings of black holes by heating and blowing away the gas and dust around them.          At immense scales, \"disk winds\" can offer clues to how supermassive black holes shape entire galaxies. Astronomers have observed signs of disk winds in many systems, including accreting black holes and neutron stars. But to date, they've only ever glimpsed a very narrow view of this phenomenon.Now, MIT astronomers have observed a wider swath of winds, in Hercules X-1, a system in which a neutron star is drawing material away from a sun-like star. This neutron star's accretion disk is unique in that it wobbles, or \"precesses,\" as it rotates. By taking advantage of this wobble, the astronomers have captured varying perspectives of the rotating disk and created a two-dimensional map of its winds, for the first time.The new map reveals the wind's vertical shape and structure, as well as its velocity\u2014around hundreds of kilometers per second, or about a million miles per hour, which is on the milder end of what accretion disks can spin up.If astronomers can spot more wobbling systems in the future, the team's mapping technique could help determine how disk winds influence the formation and evolution of stellar systems, and even entire galaxies.\"In the future, we could map disk winds in a range of objects and determine how wind properties change, for instance, with the mass of a black hole, or with how much material it is accreting,\" says Peter Kosec, a postdoc in MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. \"That will help determine how black holes and neutron stars influence our universe.\"Kosec is the lead author of the study, which is published in Nature Astronomy. His MIT co-authors include Erin Kara, Daniele Rogantini, and Claude Canizares, along with collaborators from multiple institutions, including the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge, U.K.Fixed sightDisk winds have most often been observed in X-ray binaries\u2014systems in which a black hole or a neutron star is pulling material from a less dense object and generating a white-hot disk of inspiraling matter, along with outflowing wind. Exactly how winds are launched from these systems is unclear. Some theories propose that magnetic fields could shred the disk and expel some of the material outward as wind. Others posit that the neutron star's radiation could heat and evaporate the disk's surface in white-hot gusts.Clues to a wind's origins may be deduced from its structure, but the shape and extent of disk winds has been difficult to resolve. Most binaries produce accretion disks that are relatively even in shape, like thin donuts of gas that spins in a single plane. Astronomers who study these disks from far-off satellites or telescopes can only observe the effects of disk winds within a fixed and narrow range, relative to their rotating disk. Any wind that astronomers manage to detect is therefore a small sliver of its larger structure.\"We can only probe the wind properties at a single point, and we're completely blind to everything around that point,\" Kosec notes.In 2020, he and his colleagues realized that one binary system could offer a wider view of disk winds. Hercules X-1 has stood out from most known X-ray binaries for its warped accretion disk, which wobbles as it rotates around the system's central neutron star.\"The disk is really wobbling over time every 35 days, and the winds are originating somewhere in the disk and crossing our line of sight at different heights above the disk with time,\" Kosec explains. \"That's a very unique property of this system which allows us to better understand its vertical wind properties.\"      A warped wobbleIn the new study, the researchers observed Hercules X-1 using two X-ray telescopes\u2014the European Space Agency's XMM Newton and NASA's Chandra Observatory.\"What we measure is an X-ray spectrum, which means the amount of X-ray photons that arrive at our detectors, versus their energy. We measure the absorption lines, or the lack of X-ray light at very specific energies,\" Kosec says. \"From the ratio of how strong the different lines are, we can determine the temperature, velocity, and the amount of plasma within the disk wind.\"With Hercules X-1's warped disk, astronomers were able to see the line of the disk moving up and down as it wobbled and rotated, similar to the way a warped record appears to oscillate when seen from edge-on. The effect was such that the researchers could observe signs of disk winds at changing heights with respect to the disk, rather than at a single, fixed height above a uniformly rotating disk.By measuring X-ray emissions and the absorption lines as the disk wobbled and rotated over time, the researchers could scan properties such as the temperature and density of winds at various heights with respect to its disk and construct a two-dimensional map of the wind's vertical structure.\"What we see is that the wind rises from the disk, at an angle of about 12 degrees with respect to the disk as it expands in space,\" Kosec says. \"It's also getting colder and more clumpy, and weaker at greater heights above the disk.\"The team plans to compare their observations with theoretical simulations of various wind-launching mechanisms, to see which could best explain the wind's origins. Further out, they hope to discover more warped and wobbling systems, and map their disk wind structures. Then, scientists could have a broader view of disk winds, and how such outflows influence their surroundings\u2014particularly at much larger scales.\"How do supermassive black holes affect the shape and structure of galaxies?\" poses Erin Kara, the Class of 1958 Career Development Assistant Professor of Physics at MIT. \"One of the leading hypotheses is that disk winds, launched from a black hole, can affect how galaxies look. Now we can get a more detailed picture of how these winds are launched, and what they look like.\" More information:Peter Kosec, Vertical wind structure in an X-ray binary revealed by a precessing accretion disk, Nature Astronomy (2023).

  "question_squad": " What is the effective temperature of the companion object?",
  "answer_squad": " 325 K",
  "text": "Using the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), an international team of astronomers has discovered the first known binary system composed of two Y-type brown dwarfs. The finding was reported in a research paper published March 29 on the arXiv pre-print repository.          Brown dwarfs are intermediate substellar objects between planets and stars with masses below the hydrogen burning limit\u2014about 80 Jupiter masses. One subclass of brown dwarfs (with effective temperatures lower than 500 K) is known as Y dwarfs, and represents the coolest and least luminous substellar objects so far detected.WISE J033605.05\u2212014350.4 (or W0336 for short) is a nearby brown dwarf of spectral type Y0 detected in 2012 with NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The object is located some 32.7 light years away in the constellation Eridanus and has an effective temperature of about 460 K.Now, new observations conducted by a group of astronomers led by Per Calissendorf of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, unveiled the presence of a companion object to W0336. The brown dwarf was observed in September 2022 as part of a JWST Cycle 1 GO program\u2014a survey of 20 Y dwarfs.\"We report the discovery of the first brown dwarf binary system with a Y dwarf primary, WISE J033605.05\u2212014350.4, observed with NIRCam on JWST with the F150W and F480M filters. We employed an empirical point spread function binary model to identify the companion, located at a projected separation of 0.''084, position angle of 295 degrees, and with contrast of 2.8 and 1.8 magnitudes in F150W and F480M, respectively,\" the researchers wrote in the paper.The observations detected a faint companion to W0336, at a physical separation of approximately 0.97 AU from it. The newfound object has a mass between five and 11.5 Jupiter masses, and its effective temperature is estimated to be 325 K. Therefore, the companion was classified as a Y-type brown dwarf.The primary brown dwarf is estimated to be between 8.5 to 18 times more massive than Jupiter, while its effective temperature is about 415 K. The system has an orbital period of seven years and its age is assumed to be 1\u20133 billion years. However, the evolutionary models suggest that the binary W0336 may be even older than 5 billion years.The researchers noted that W0336 is a tightly bound system with a relatively low mass-ratio (of about 0.61)\u2014what is in contrast to other known binaries containing a Y-type brown dwarf. Hence, it is still difficult to conclude whether such systems represent the true binary population of ultracool dwarfs or can be considered as peculiar systems.The authors of the paper propose follow-up spectroscopic and photometric observations of W0336 over a wide wavelength range in order to shed more light on the properties of both Y dwarfs.

  "text": "A gamma-ray burst is the most violent explosion in the universe. The research on gamma-ray bursts, including a central engine, magnetized dynamics of plasmas, and radiation, is one of the hot topics in the high-energy astrophysical research.       The so-called \"brightest of all time\" gamma-ray burst, GRB 221009A, has been detected by satellites and ground-based telescopes. The burst has a strong emission in the TeV energy band.Researchers led by Profs. Mao Jirong and Wang Jiancheng from the Yunnan Observatories (YNAO) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have explored the radiation mechanism of GRB 221009A. Their findings were published in The Astrophysical Journal on April 4.The researchers proposed a novel radiation mechanism, i.e., the radiation of the relativistic electrons in the random and small-scale magnetic field. They applied this mechanism to explain the very high energy emission of GRB 221009A. In particular, for this mechanism, they utilized the Landau damping, a plasma effect, to constrain the emission of GRB 221009A in the TeV energy band.Furthermore, they treated the mechanism as a kind of coherent radiation to reproduce the emission flux of GRB 221009A. Thus, the observation properties of the burst are theoretically interpreted by this radiation mechanism.

  "text": "In August 2019, Chloe Fishman crawled into a cave beneath the largest active volcano on the planet. Along with scientists from NASA and other institutions, she had come to Hawaii's Mauna Loa volcano to study the microscopic life-forms that could survive underneath, in the dark and isolated subterranean environment known as a \"lava tube.\"          Fishman lowered herself 30 feet through an opening in the ground formed where part of the tube had collapsed. She was wearing a headlamp, gloves, and knee pads. As Fishman reached deeper into the darkness, she felt the temperature drop. The moisture in the air swallowed her. When her feet touched the cave floor, Fishman began to look around: \"It felt like I had entered a different world,\" she said.She may as well have been on Mars. And that's precisely why Fishman and her colleagues had come to Hawaii.\"The microbes we found in Hawaii could be similar to microbes that once lived on Mars, or even microbes that live there today,\" said Fishman, who, at the time of this study, was an undergraduate researcher in the lab of Sarah Stewart Johnson, an associate professor at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Fishman now is a researcher at the Gladstone Institutes at the University of California, San Francisco.Microbes thrived in the Mauna Loan lava tube, Fishman and her colleagues found, even in areas that received no sunlight, which most living things on Earth need to survive. In these dark areas, the microbes likely were using chemicals in the rocks for nourishment.Fishman and her colleagues discovered dozens of previously unidentified species of microbes. They also gathered insights about their habitats that will inform strategies to one day collect samples in Martian lava tubes, the researchers reported on Feb. 17, 2023, in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets. Mars is one of NASA's top destinations to search for signs of ancient or current micro-organisms, with several missions underway or being developed.The lava tube Fishman and her colleagues studied, located on the northern flank of the volcano, formed about 200 years ago, qualifying it as \"young\" on the geologic time scale of billions of years. Less affected than older tubes by water and other weathering conditions, a young Hawaiian tube better resembles Martian lava tubes as they were billions of years ago.When lava tubes first formed on Mars, the Red Planet was likely similar to Earth, with active volcanoes, an atmosphere, a warmer climate, and flowing water. Since these conditions helped nurture life on Earth, they may have done the same on Mars. Even though the Martian surface became inhospitable to living creatures after the planet shed its atmosphere, cooled, and dried up about 3 billion years ago, microbes could have migrated underground, scientists suspect.      Inside the Hawaiian lava tube, illuminated by headlamps, the walls were lit up in a mural of yellow, orange, pink, green, and white. These materials contained a range of minerals, including gypsum and calcite, arranged in shapes that reminded Fishman of mushrooms and popcorn. While Fishman had come to the cave to scrape flakes from the to bring back to the lab to look for microbial life, most of her colleagues had come to study the minerals. The mineral work is ongoing, but it will intersect with Fishman's if some of the minerals turn out to be more likely than others to host microbes. Insight from this research could help Martian rovers pinpoint promising sites to sample for signs of past or present life.\"We have identified minerals similar to those found at Mauna Loa on the Martian surface and right below it,\" said Amy McAdam, a geochemist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. McAdam is a member of the science team behind NASA's Curiosity rover, which is exploring Mars, and also analyzing samples plucked from the surface in its onboard chemistry lab.\"Even if it's difficult to tease out signs of life in Martian minerals, we can still learn a lot from them about the environmental conditions of early Mars and whether those conditions were friendly to life or not,\" McAdam said.After a week of work in the lava tube, Fishman brought back about 20 half-teaspoon-size samples to Johnson's lab. She poured each one into a test tube filled with liquid and glass beads the size of sand grains. A device in the lab shook them to break apart the samples, thereby releasing cells into the liquid. This allowed Fishman to extract DNA from the cells. Sequencing the DNA revealed the genetic codes for the organisms.Fishman has sequenced the genomes of 72 new organisms. So far, she has analyzed the genomes of two microbes, which allowed her to classify them based on their characteristics and to add them to global databases. More information:C. B.

  "text": "On Feb. 22, 1971, a sounding rocket lifted off from Wallops Island, Virginia, with specialized sensors aimed at the Crab Nebula, a bright cosmic object 6,500 light-years away. In those days, before recovering physical tapes from the experiment, scientists first received scientific data on a strip chart recorder, a device that printed signals on paper. Astronomer Martin Weisskopf and his colleagues began their analysis on launch day by measuring the distance between signals using a ruler and pencil.          \"What makes science so beautiful and exciting is that for those few moments, you're seeing something that no one has ever seen before,\" said Weisskopf, now an emeritus astronomer at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.Decades later, Weisskopf proposed the development of an Earth-orbiting satellite with powerful instruments that could gather much more detailed measurements of the same kind about the Crab Nebula and other mysterious cosmic objects. That satellite became NASA's Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), which launched on December 9, 2021.Now, more than 50 years after the sounding rocket experiment, scientists have used IXPE to create a detailed, nuanced map of the Crab Nebula's magnetic field, revealing more of its inner workings than ever before. The new results, accepted for publication in the journal Nature Astronomy (preprint available), help resolve longstanding mysteries about the well-studied Crab Nebula and open new questions for future study.IXPE data show that the Crab Nebula's magnetic field resembles that of the Vela Pulsar Wind Nebula, which is also donut-shaped. But at the Crab, scientists were surprised that areas of magnetic field turbulence were more patchy and asymmetrical than expected.                The Crab Pulsar is a famous astronomical object, about 6,500 light-years from Earth, that originated with the explosion of a massive star. The nebula around the Crab contains a donut-shaped magnetic field, which NASA\u2019s Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observed. The orange lines highlight the shape of the magnetic field determined by IXPE. It is superimposed on a composite image made with data from the Chandra X-Ray Observatory (blue and white), Hubble Space Telescope (purple), and Spitzer Space Telescope (pink).

The explosion left behind a dense object called the Crab Pulsar, about the diameter of Huntsville, Alabama or the length of Manhattan, but with as much mass as about two Suns. The chaotic mess of gases, shock waves, magnetic fields and high-energy light and particles coming from the rotating pulsar is collectively called a \"pulsar wind nebula.\" These extreme conditions make for a bizarre environment that is not yet thoroughly understood.      Weisskopf and colleagues were hoping to understand this extreme environment in a new way by measuring the polarization of X-rays from the Crab Nebula, which shines brightly in X-rays. X-ray polarization gives scientists clues to the direction where the magnetic field points in different parts of a cosmic object, as well as how well ordered the magnetic field is. The magnetic field's geometry and turbulence determines how particles get catapulted toward the speed of light.                NASA\u2019s Martin Weisskopf and colleagues from Columbia University in 1971 pose with the Aerobee-350 sounding rocket they used to detect X-ray polarization from a celestial object\u2014the Crab Nebula\u2014for the first time. Left to right are Robert Novick, Gabriel Epstein, Weisskopf, Richard Wolff, and Richard Linke. Credit: NASA             In the five minutes that the 1971 sounding rocket experiment spent above Earth's atmosphere, it produced the world's first X-ray polarization measurements.Scientists followed up with a satellite called OSO-8 in 1975, which also measured the X-ray polarization of the Crab Nebula. The rocket and the satellite produced generally the same result: That the Crab Nebula has an average polarization of about 20%.As project scientist of NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory, which launched in 1999, Weisskopf continued his exploration of the Crab Nebula in new ways. With Chandra, \"we took beautiful images of the nebula and pulsar, and we could see the jets and the various structures,\" he said. Chandra's X-ray imaging revealed wisp-like structures that move in the nebula, and helped scientists to further understand the relationship between the pulsar's energy and X-ray emissions.Nearly every recent large telescope has pointed to the Crab Nebula to better understand this mysterious supernova remnant. But only IXPE can study X-rays from Crab in terms of polarization, a measure of the organization of electromagnetic fields.\"The Crab is one of the most-studied high-energy astrophysical objects in the sky. So it is extremely exciting that we could learn something new about this system by looking through IXPE's 'polarized lenses,'\" said Michela Negro, a research scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center affiliated with the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and a co-author of the study.Across the entire nebula, IXPE found about the same average polarization as Weisskopf and colleagues did in the 1970s. But with more sophisticated instruments, IXPE was able to refine the angle of polarization and examine the differences in polarization across the entire object. Scientists see areas of much polarization in the outer regions of the nebula, light-years away from the pulsar, where polarization is lower.This enabled scientists to investigate not just X-rays from the Crab Nebula but also those coming from the pulsar itself, or the sphere of magnetic fields around it. The findings suggest that those X-rays originate in the outer magnetic field region, called the \"wind\" region, although exactly where and how is still unknown. Within the magnetic field, shocks generated by the pulsar's \"wind\" are propelling particles close to the speed of light.\"I'm very proud of everybody associated with IXPE,\" said Weisskopf, who was the mission's first principal investigator. \"Everybody has worked so hard, and it works as advertised.\" Reflecting on his work on the 1971 experiment that laid the groundwork for the new results, Weisskopf says, \"It's like somebody said to me, 'Martin, you did good.'\" More information:Niccol\u00f2 Bucciantini et al, Simultaneous space and phase resolved X-ray polarimetry of the Crab Pulsar and Nebula, arXiv (2022).
