   "text": "Thomas Edison famously tried hundreds of materials and failed thousands of times before discovering that carbonized cotton thread burned long and bright in an incandescent light bulb. Experiments are often time-consuming (Edison's team spent 14 months) and expensive (the winning combination cost about $850,000 in today's money).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpenses and time increase exponentially when developing the quantum materials that will revolutionize modern electronics and computing.\nTo make quantum material discovery possible, researchers turn to detailed databases as their virtual laboratory. A new database of understudied quantum materials that has been created by researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) provides an avenue to discover new materials that could power gadgets far more powerful than Edison's lightbulb.\nBeyond Edisonian trial and error\n\"We wanted to understand a general class of materials that have the same crystal structure, but different properties depending on how you combine and grow them,\" said materials scientist Tim Pope. This class of materials, known as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), contains thousands of potential combinations, each of which requires a weeks'-long reaction to grow flakes of material the size of glitter.\nMaking the material is only the first step in understanding what it can do. As PNNL computational scientist Micah Prange said, each flake is \"really small, really delicate,\" and quantum features will only emerge when studied at super-low temperatures. Essentially, \"a whole research program could go into each flake.\"\nDespite the difficulty of creating and measuring them, each combination holds promise to dramatically improve electronics, batteries, pollution remediation, and quantum computing devices.\n]Prange said you can think of the flakes as \"fancier graphene with a richer phenomenology and more practical possibilities.\" Tough, light, and flexible, graphene has been known as the material of the future, with uses in everything from aerospace to wearable electronics.\n\"The varied properties across this class of materials mean that as we better understand them, one of the combinations could be selected for a desired property and exactly paired to the ideal use,\" said Pope, \"or even a brand new application.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                Close up of a flake next to an image of its crystal structure overlaid with the model\u2019s predicted crystal structure.

They can also be grown in three different crystal structures, meaning there are thousands of potential combinations, all with distinct properties.\nUsing a type of modeling called density functional theory, the researchers computed the properties of 672 unique structures with a total of 50,337 individual atomic configurations. Before this research, there were fewer than 40 studied configurations, with only a rudimentary understanding of their properties.\n\"Models can work out the quantum mechanics of how atoms are arranged,\" said Prange. \"From this, you can say if the material will conduct electricity or be transparent or how hard the material will be to compress or bend.\"\nUsing the database, PNNL's researchers revealed striking differences in the electrical and magnetic behaviors between different combinations. Importantly, the researchers also found other trends as they varied the transition metal, including a new understanding of transition metal chemistry at the quantum level.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nQuantum combinations for machine learning\n\"When the crystal structure was overlaid with the database, it matched perfectly,\" said Pope, speaking of the PNNL-grown flakes that are beginning to validate the modeling results.\n\"The idea was really to develop a big data set of theoretical simulations so we could use data analytics to understand these materials,\" said Prange. \"The immediate value of the project is that we did enough different cases to efficiently use machine learning.\"\nThe open-source dataset, published in Scientific Data, offers researchers a strong starting point for exploring relationships between initial structures and corresponding properties. With this information, they can downselect to specific materials for study.\n\"This project is one example of how we can use a large computational dataset to guide the experimental research,\" said CDI Chief Scientist Peter Sushko, \"Projects like this provide critical data to the machine learning community and could streamline materials development.

   "text": "In the early 2000s, scientists from the UK made a worrisome discovery that the oceans are teeming with small particles of plastic (less than one millimeter in length) due to the continuous degradation of plastic waste. These microscopic particles of plastic have become a major environmental concern. Scientists classify these small particles as either microplastics or nanoplastics based on their size; the latter term is used exclusively for particles smaller than one micrometer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese particles easily get embedded into the bodies of marine and freshwater animals, which has raised alarms regarding the pervasive problem of micro- and nanoplastics pollution. Unfortunately, despite substantial efforts, researchers are yet to decipher the detailed mechanisms through which micro- and nanoplastics originate and change over time.\nThe issue lies mainly in the techniques that have been used so far to observe the degradation process of plastic particles. Simply put, these methods cannot observe the degradation into single particles in real time.\nAgainst this backdrop, a research team led by Associate Professor Daisuke Suzuki from Shinshu University in Japan set out to find a solution to this challenge. In their latest study, which was published in Soft Matter, they demonstrated an innovative approach to observe the degradation process of single microgel particles in real time with nanometric precision. The study was co-authored by Professor Takayuki Uchihashi from Nagoya University in Japan.\nThe proposed approach has two main lines of investigation. In the first part of the study, a microgel was used as a model for understanding the behavior of nanoplastic particles. The microgel employed was composed of a polymer with cross-linking points that could be cleaved via chemical reactions using an oxidizing agent. In other words, the bonds between the long fiber-like molecules that made up the tiny microgel spheres could be broken in a semi-controlled way by adjusting the temperature and the chemical environment.\nThe second main line of investigation of the study was the development of a state-of-the-art technique to visualize the degradation of the microgel in real time. The researchers employed a carefully configured high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) setup, which involved 'touching' the sample with an atomic-sized tip placed at the end of a cantilever and measuring its deflection. Thanks to HS-AFM, the team could observe the change in the shape of the microgel over time with extremely high precision.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nAfter several experiments at different temperatures and microgel compositions, the researchers gained valuable insight into how nanoplastics originate and evolve over time depending on their environment. \"The experiments revealed that while nanoplastics containing water easily allowed chemical reactants to diffuse inside, nanoplastics in a water-free state do not readily allow reactants to diffuse. Thus, nanoplastics in different states exhibited completely different degradation behaviors,\" explains Prof. Suzuki.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Soft Matter (2023). DOI: 10.1039/D3SM00216K\n\nThe videos of the microgels degrading in real time illustrate how useful this new approach could be to further the understanding of micro- and nanoplastics. Excited about the possible implications of their remarkable work, Prof. Suzuki comments, \"The presented approach has the potential to be expanded into an observation technique that can assess not only temperature variations, but also other external stimuli encountered in everyday life, such as ultraviolet light and stress, enabling nanoscale observations in diverse environmental conditions.\"\nOverall, the results of this study will pave the way to a better understanding of nanoplastics. In turn, this will give scientists and engineers a better chance at fighting this elusive facet of marine pollution.\nMoreover, since micro- and nanoplastics are essential materials used in everyday products like adhesives, paints, and cosmetics, having a firmer grasp on their degradation process will help devise guidelines to mitigate their environmental impact. Such knowledge would also be useful in advanced drug delivery systems, where gels play a pivotal role as delivery agents for drugs.\nProf. Suzuki concludes, \"This research will hopefully generate interest in micro- and nanoplastics among the general public, prompting them to reconsider their plastic usage, the primary source of nanoplastics.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYuichiro Nishizawa et al, Single microgel degradation governed by heterogeneous nanostructures, Soft Matter (2023).

The manufacturing of these devices is a time-consuming and cost-intensive process and, therefore, in the last twenty years, with the development of systems using ultra-short pulse lasers (10-12 to 10-15 seconds), laser processing techniques are being used to produce faster and more environmentally sustainable equipment.\nThe experience of the Holography and Optical Processing Group\u2014led by lecturers Augusto Bel\u00e9ndez and Inmaculada Pascual\u2014has opened up a new line of research in the manufacture of tunable devices such as lenses and waveguides manufactured by techniques such as laser printing.\nIn this sense, Daniel Puerto stresses that the use of polymer-based materials allows their use in technologies that are already being developed and that aim to make devices such as mobiles, tablets, etc. foldable. For this purpose, the use of flexible materials such as polymers are essential.\nAccording to the researcher, we have the perfect element for the development of the technology of the future If we want them to be tunable.

   "text": "Despite steady improvements in quantum computers, they're still noisy and error-prone, which leads to questionable or wrong answers. Scientists predict that they won't truly outcompete today's \"classical\" supercomputers for at least five or ten years, until researchers can adequately correct the errors that bedevil entangled quantum bits, or qubits.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut a new study shows that even lacking good error correction, there are ways to mitigate errors that could make quantum computers useful today.\nResearchers at IBM Quantum in New York and their collaborators at the University of California, Berkeley, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory report today (June 14) in the journal Nature that they pitted a 127-qubit quantum computer against a state-of-the-art supercomputer, and for at least one type of calculation, bested the supercomputer.\nThe calculation wasn't chosen because it was difficult for classical computers, the researchers say, but because it's similar to ones that physicists make all the time. Crucially, the calculation could be made increasingly complex in order to test whether today's noisy, error-prone quantum computers can produce accurate results for certain types of common calculations.\nThe fact that the quantum computer produced the verifiably correct solution as the calculation became more complex, while the supercomputer algorithm produced an incorrect answer, provides hope that quantum computing algorithms with error mitigation, instead of the more difficult error correction, could tackle cutting-edge physics problems, such as understanding the quantum properties of superconductors and novel electronic materials.\n\"We're entering the regime where the quantum computer might be able to do things that current algorithms on classical computers cannot do,\" said UC Berkeley graduate student and study co-author Sajant Anand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUC Berkeley\u2019s Sajant Anand and IBM researchers discuss a new study that shows error mitigation can give quantum computers an edge over supercomputers in some common physics calculations. Credit: IBM Research\n\n\"We can start to think of quantum computers as a tool for studying problems that we wouldn't be able to study otherwise,\" added Sarah Sheldon, senior manager for Quantum Theory and Capabilities at IBM Quantum.\nConversely, the quantum computer's trouncing of the classical computer could also spark new ideas to improve the quantum algorithms now used on classical computers, according to co-author Michael Zaletel, UC Berkeley associate professor of physics and holder of the Thomas and Alison Schneider Chair in Physics.\n\"Going into it, I was pretty sure that the classical method would do better than the quantum one,\" he said. \"So, I had mixed emotions when IBM's zero-noise extrapolated version did better than the classical method. But thinking about how the quantum system is working might actually help us figure out the right classical way to approach the problem. While the quantum computer did something that the standard classical algorithm couldn't, we think it's an inspiration for making the classical algorithm better so that the classical computer performs just as well as the quantum computer in the future.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nBoost the noise to suppress the noise\nOne key to the seeming advantage of IBM's quantum computer is quantum error mitigation, a novel technique for dealing with the noise that accompanies a quantum computation. Paradoxically, IBM researchers controllably increased the noise in their quantum circuit to get even noisier, less accurate answers and then extrapolated backward to estimate the answer the computer would have gotten if there had been no noise. This relies on having a good understanding of the noise that affects quantum circuits and predicting how it affects the output.\nThe problem of noise comes about because IBM's qubits are sensitive superconducting circuits that represent the zeroes and ones of a binary computation. When the qubits are entangled for a calculation, unavoidable annoyances such as heat and vibration can alter the entanglement, introducing errors. The greater the entanglement, the worse the effects of noise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantum computers have the potential to solve some of the world\u2019s biggest problems, but they are limited by their extreme sensitivity to errors caused by environmental noise. New research from IBM Quantum and UC Berkeley shows that a family of computational techniques called quantum error mitigation could allow quantum computers to solve useful problems at a scale far beyond the capability of even the most sophisticated classical supercomputing methods. Credit: IBM Research\n\nIn addition, computations that act on one set of qubits can introduce random errors in other, uninvolved qubits. Additional computations then compound these errors. Scientists hope to use extra qubits to monitor such errors so they can be corrected\u2014so-called fault-tolerant error correction. But achieving scalable fault-tolerance is a huge engineering challenge, and whether it will work in practice for ever greater numbers of qubits remains to be shown, Zaletel said.\nInstead, IBM engineers came up with a strategy of error mitigation they called zero noise extrapolation (ZNE), which uses probabilistic methods to controllably increase the noise on the quantum device. Based on a recommendation from a former intern, IBM researchers approached Anand, postdoctoral researcher Yantao Wu and Zaletel to ask their help in assessing the accuracy of the results obtained using this error mitigation strategy. Zaletel develops supercomputer algorithms to solve difficult calculations involving quantum systems, such as the electronic interactions in new materials. These algorithms, which employ tensor network simulations, can be directly applied to simulate interacting qubits in a quantum computer.\nOver a period of several weeks, Youngseok Kim and Andrew Eddins at IBM Quantum ran increasingly complex quantum calculations on the advanced IBM Quantum Eagle processor, and then Anand attempted the same calculations using state-of-the-art classical methods on the Cori supercomputer and Lawrencium cluster at Berkeley Lab and the Anvil supercomputer at Purdue University. When Quantum Eagle was rolled out in 2021, it had the highest number of high-quality qubits of any quantum computer, seemingly beyond the ability of classical computers to simulate.\nIn fact, exactly simulating all 127 entangled qubits on a classical computer would require an astronomical amount of memory. The quantum state would need to be represented by 2 to the power of 127 separate numbers. That's 1 followed by 38 zeroes; typical computers can store around 100 billion numbers, 27 orders of magnitude too small. To simplify the problem, Anand, Wu and Zaletel used approximation techniques that allowed them to solve the problem on a classical computer in a reasonable amount of time, and at a reasonable cost. These methods are somewhat like jpeg image compression, in that they get rid of less important information and keep only what's required to achieve accurate answers within the limits of the memory available.\nAnand confirmed the accuracy of the quantum computer's results for the less complex calculations, but as the depth of the calculations grew, the results of the quantum computer diverged from those of the classical computer. For certain specific parameters, Anand was able to simplify the problem and calculate exact solutions that verified the quantum calculations over the classical computer calculations. At the largest depths considered, exact solutions were not available, yet the quantum and classical results disagreed.\nThe researchers caution that while they can't prove that the quantum computer's final answers for the hardest calculations were correct, Eagle's successes on the previous runs gave them confidence that they were.\n\"The success of the quantum computer wasn't like a fine-tuned accident. It actually worked for a whole family of circuits it was being applied to,\" Zaletel said.\n\n\n\n\n\n                IBM\u2019s quantum computer is housed inside a cryogenic container (center) surrounded by a tangle of cables used to control and read out its qubits. Credit: IBM\n             \n\n\nFriendly competition\nWhile Zaletel is cautious about predicting whether this error mitigation technique will work for more qubits or calculations of greater depth, the results were nonetheless inspiring, he said.\n\"It sort of spurred a feeling of friendly competition,\" he said. \"I have a sense that we should be able to simulate on a classical computer what they're doing. But we need to think about it in a clever and better way\u2014the quantum device is in a regime where it suggests we need a different approach.\"\nOne approach is to simulate the ZNE technique developed by IBM.\n\"Now, we're asking if we can take the same error mitigation concept and apply it to classical tensor network simulations to see if we can get better classical results,\" Anand said. \"This work gives us the ability to maybe use a quantum computer as a verification tool for the classical computer, which is flipping the script on what's usually done.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYoungseok Kim et al, Evidence for the utility of quantum computing before fault tolerance, Nature (2023).

The two-dimensional material hBN is considered a remarkable host for color-center spin defects. The spin defects in hBN have attracted great attention with their advantages in two-dimensional quantum devices and integrated quantum nanodevices.\nAmong the discovered spin defects in hBN, the negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) defect is the most prevailing one. Researchers from Prof. Guo's team in their previous research conducted the measurement of temperature dependence based on the VB- defect and demonstrated the coherent dynamics of the multi-spin VB- center.\nThey found it hard to detect a single VB- defect for its low-quantum efficiency for the optical transition. Despite several reports of enhanced photoluminescence of the VB- defect, observing the coherent control of a single spin is still a challenge.\nIn this study, the researchers managed to isolate individual color centers in hBN powder samples with the help of capillary force. They discovered a class of ultrabright single-spin color centers with an excellent probability of 85%, which is enhanced by 21-fold compared with previous methods.\nThe researchers then measured its optical properties with significant antibunching characteristics and photon emissivity up to 25 MHz, which is the highest fluorescence count of single spin color centers found in hBN so far. They further captured its Rabi oscillation signal and conducted Hahn echo experiments. It was the first time that a single-spin color center in hBN was manipulated at room temperature, representing a new stage in the application of quantum information.\nMoreover, the researchers realized the first principles calculations to clarify the structure of this color-center defect. It was found that the complex of carbon-oxygen dopants may be the source of this type of single-spin color-center defects, and the simulated optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra of the CNCB3 model are consistent with the experimental results.\nThe coherent control of an ultrabright single spin in hBN at room temperature takes a leap in quantum areas, which provides a possibility for addressing spins that can be optically controlled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNai-Jie Guo et al, Coherent control of an ultrabright single spin in hexagonal boron nitride at room temperature, Nature Communications (2023).

   "text": "A team of physicists, including University of Massachusetts assistant professor Tigran Sedrakyan, recently announced in the journal Nature that they have discovered a new phase of matter. Called the \"chiral Bose-liquid state,\" the discovery opens a new path in the age-old effort to understand the nature of the physical world.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder everyday conditions, matter can be a solid, liquid or gas. But once you venture beyond the everyday\u2014into temperatures approaching absolute zero, things smaller than a fraction of an atom or which have extremely low states of energy\u2014the world looks very different. \"You find quantum states of matter way out on these fringes,\" says Sedrakyan, \"and they are much wilder than the three classical states we encounter in our everyday lives.\"\nSedrakyan has spent years exploring these wild quantum states, and he is particularly interested in the possibility of what physicists call \"band degeneracy,\" \"moat bands\" or \"kinetic frustration\" in strongly interacting quantum matter.\nTypically, particles in any system bump into each other, and in so doing they cause predictable effects, like billiard balls knocking into each other and then reacting in a predictable pattern. In other words, the effects and the particles are correlated. But in a frustrated quantum system, there are infinite possibilities that stem from the interaction of particles\u2014perhaps the billiard ball levitates or zooms off at an impossible angle\u2014and some of these infinite possibilities can lead to novel quantum states.\nWhat Sedrakyan and his colleagues have done is to engineer a frustration machine: a bilayer semiconducting device. The top layer is electron-rich, and these electrons can move freely. The bottom layer is filled with \"holes,\" or places that a roving electron can occupy. Then the two layers are brought extremely close together\u2014interatomic close.\nIf the number of electrons in the top layer and holes in the bottom layer were equal, then you would expect to see the particles acting in a correlated manner, but Sedrakyan and his colleagues designed the bottom layer so that there is a local imbalance between the number of electrons and holes in the bottom layer. \"It's like a game of musical chairs,\" Sedrakyan says, \"designed to frustrate the electrons. Instead of each electron having one chair to go to, they must now scramble and have many possibilities in where they 'sit.'\"\nThis frustration kicks off the novel chiral edge state, which has a number of surprising characteristics. For instance, if you cool quantum matter in a chiral state down to absolute zero, the electrons freeze into a predictable pattern, and the emergent charge-neutral particles in this state will all either spin clockwise or counterclockwise. Even if you smash another particle into one of these electrons, or you introduce a magnetic field, you can't alter its spin\u2014it's surprisingly robust and can even be used to encode digital data in a fault-tolerant way.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nEven more surprisingly is what happens when an outside particle does smash into one of the particles in the chiral edge state. To return to the billiard-ball metaphor, you would expect to send the eight-ball flying when the cue ball smacks into it. But if the pool balls were in a chiral Bose-liquid state, all 15 of them would react in exactly the same way when the eight-ball was struck. This effect is due to the long-range entanglement present in this quantum system.\nIt is difficult to observe the chiral Bose-liquid state, which is why it has remained hidden for so long. To do so, the team of scientists, including theoretical physicists Rui Wang and Baigeng Wang (both of Nanjing University) as well as experimental physicists Lingjie Du (Nanjing University) and Rui-Rui Du (Peking University) designed a theory and an experiment that used an extremely strong magnetic field that is capable of measuring the movements of the electrons as they race for chairs.\n\"On the edge of the semiconductor bilayer, electrons and holes move with the same velocities,\" says Lingjie Du. \"This leads to helical-like transport, which can be further modulated by external magnetic fields as the electron and hole channels are gradually separated under higher fields.\"\nThe magneto-transport experiments therefore successfully reveal the first piece of evidence of the chiral Bose-liquid, which the authors also call the \"excitonic topological order\" in the published paper.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRui-Rui Du, Excitonic topological order in imbalanced electron\u2013hole bilayers, Nature (2023).

   "text": "When two heavy ions collide at very high relativistic energies, they penetrate one another, during which they become excited and are slowed down. This \"stopping\" process can be generated experimentally, as demonstrated on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Europe's CERN research center in Geneva (Switzerland).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, however, the stopping process cannot be directly observed at the LHC. An international team led by Prof. Dr. Georg Wolschin, a physicist at Heidelberg University, recently calculated how the stopping process might look during collisions at very high energies in the LHC. The researchers hope to also gain new insights into original states of matter in the early universe, especially on the interaction of quarks\u2014the material components of protons and neutrons\u2014with gluons.\nHeavy ions like the nuclei of atoms of larger mass\u2014such as gold or lead\u2014are positively charged and can be accelerated in electrical fields to nearly the speed of light. They are used, in particular, in studying the so-called quark-gluon plasma. In this original state of matter, the elementary quark and gluon particles move freely before forming protons, neutrons, or other strongly interacting particles.\nIn the early universe after the Big Bang, there was a very similar exotic state of matter lasting about ten microseconds, explains Georg Wolschin of Heidelberg University's Institute for Theoretical Physics. This state can be generated today using particle accelerators like the LHC very briefly for about 10-23 seconds but can only be observed indirectly rather than directly.\n\"During the collision of heavy ions, they are slowed down, and at the same time new elementary particles are created,\" explains Prof. Wolschin. Although the stopping process can be precisely measured at lower energies, until now it has not been possible to record the stopping of heavy ions at sufficiently small angles at the very high LHC acceleration energies.\nA measurement perpendicular to the beam as is possible already at the Large Hadron Collider is not sufficient to obtain a complete picture, explains the physicist. In collaboration with colleagues from Heidelberg and Japan, Georg Wolschin used a nonequilibrium-statistical model to predict how this stopping process could look.\nThe physicists based their calculations on a relativistic diffusion model. This model emerges from a nonequilibrium-statistical theory and is consistent with quantum chromodynamics\u2014the theory of strong interactions, which deals with one of the four fundamental forces of physics. The researchers first compared existing data from measurements at lower energies with their model.\n\"These data can be described well using our relativistic diffusion model,\" states Prof. Wolschin. On that basis it was then possible to derive theoretical predictions on the stopping behavior of heavy ions at the higher acceleration energies in the teraelectronvolt energy range at the LHC. However, to be able to compare them with data from experimental measurements first requires additional measurement equipment at the Large Hadron Collider, emphasizes the researcher.\nUsing their calculations, the researchers expect future experimental measurements at the Large Hadron Collider not only to confirm the predicted stopping behavior but also provide new insights into the properties of gluons. In quantum chromodynamics, these massless particles are the carrier particles of strong interaction.\nThey mediate the forces between quarks and are also indirectly responsible for the attraction between protons and neutrons in an atomic nucleus. Particle collisions in the LHC generate high temperatures, explains Georg Wolschin. In the process, gluons can interact with one another elastically, i.e. without changing the number of particles, or inelastically, i.e. generating or destroying particles.\n\"Through elastic interactions, a new state of matter, the gluon condensate, could in principle arise. It should be possible to derive the conditions under which this state can be achieved,\" explains the Heidelberg physicist.\nThe findings are published in the journal Physics Letters B.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohannes Hoelck et al, Limiting fragmentation in heavy-ion stopping?, Physics Letters B (2023).

   "text": "Researchers from the UvA Institute of Physics and ENS de Lyon have discovered how to design materials that necessarily have a point or line where the material doesn't deform under stress, and that even remember how they have been poked or squeezed in the past. These results could be used in robotics and mechanical computers, while similar design principles could be used in quantum computers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outcome is a breakthrough in the field of metamaterials: designer materials whose responses are determined by their structure rather than their chemical composition. To construct a metamaterial with mechanical memory, physicists Xiaofei Guo, Marcelo Guzm\u00e1n, David Carpentier, Denis Bartolo and Corentin Coulais realized that its design needs to be \"frustrated,\" and that this frustration corresponds to a new type of order, which they call non-orientable order.\nPhysics with a twist\nA simple example of a non-orientable object is a M\u00f6bius strip, made by taking a strip of material, adding half a twist to it and then gluing its ends together. You can try this at home with a strip of paper. Following the surface of a M\u00f6bius strip with your finger, you'll find that when you get back to your starting point, your finger will be on the other side of the paper.\nA M\u00f6bius strip is non-orientable because there is no way to label the two sides of the strip in a consistent manner; the twist makes the entire surface one and the same. This is in contrast to a simple cylinder (a strip without any twists whose ends are glued together), which has a distinct inner and outer surface.\nGuo and her colleagues realized that this non-orientability strongly affects how an object or metamaterial responds to being pushed or squeezed. If you place a simple cylinder and a M\u00f6bius strip on a flat surface and press down on them from above, you'll find that the sides of the cylinder will all bulge out (or in), while the sides of the M\u00f6bius strip cannot do the same. Instead, the non-orientability of the latter ensures that there is always a point along the strip where it does not deform under pressure.\nFrustration is not always a bad thing\nExcitingly, this behavior extends far beyond M\u00f6bius strips.\n\"We discovered that the behavior of non-orientable objects such as M\u00f6bius strips allows us to describe any material that is globally frustrated. These materials naturally want to be ordered, but something in their structure forbids the order to span the whole system and forces the ordered pattern to vanish at one point or line in space. There is no way to get rid of that vanishing point without cutting the structure, so it has to be there no matter what,\" explains Coulais, who leads the Machine Materials Laboratory at the University of Amsterdam.\nThe research team designed and 3D-printed their own mechanical metamaterial structures which exhibit the same frustrated and non-orientable behavior as M\u00f6bius strips. Their designs are based on rings of squares connected by hinges at their corners. When these rings are squeezed, neighboring squares will rotate in opposite directions so that their edges move closer together. The opposite rotation of neighbors makes the system's response analogous to the anti-ferromagnetic ordering that occurs in certain magnetic materials.\nRings composed of an odd number of squares are frustrated, because there is no way for all neighboring squares to rotate in opposite directions. Squeezed odd-numbered rings therefore exhibit non-orientable order, in which the rotation angle at one point along the ring must go to zero.\nBeing a feature of the overall shape of the material makes this a robust topological property. By connecting multiple metarings together, it is even possible to emulate the mechanics of higher-dimensional topological structures such as the Klein bottle.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nMechanical memory \nHaving an enforced point or line of zero deformation is key to endowing materials with mechanical memory. Instead of squeezing a metamaterial ring from all sides, you can press the ring at distinct points. Doing so, the order in which you press different points determines where the zero deformation point or line ends up.\nThis is a form of storing information. It can even be used to execute certain types of logic gates, the basis of any computer algorithm. A simple metamaterial ring can thus function as a mechanical computer.\nBeyond mechanics, the results of the study suggest that non-orientability could be a robust design principle for metamaterials that can effectively store information across scales, in fields as diverse as colloidal science, photonics, magnetism, and atomic physics. It could even be useful for new types of quantum computers.\nCoulais concludes, \"Next, we want to exploit the robustness of the vanishing deformations for robotics. We believe the vanishing deformations could be used to create robotic arms and wheels with predictable bending and locomotion mechanisms.\"\nThe research is published in the journal Nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tXiaofei Guo, Non-orientable order and non-commutative response in frustrated metamate, Nature (2023).

Hundreds of tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide form on their surface, acting as buoys to drag them upwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Royal Society Open Science (2023). DOI: 10.1098/rsos.230376\n\n\"The bubbles prefer to form on the peanuts rather than on the glass walls,\" explained Pereira, a researcher at Germany's Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.\nWhen the bubbles reach the surface, they burst.\nThe peanuts then dive down before being propelled up again by freshly formed bubbles, in a dance that continues until the carbon dioxide runs out\u2014or someone interrupts by drinking the beer.\nIn a series of experiments, the team of researchers in Germany, Britain and France examined how roasted, shelled peanuts fared in a lager-style beer.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Example of a measurement of contact angle \u03a8 between (a) peanut\u2013beer immersed in air and (b) glass\u2013beer immersed in air.

DOI: 10.1098/rsos.230376\n             \n\n\nNext up: more beers\nThe study, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, describes two key factors in what the researchers dubbed the \"beer\u2013gas\u2013peanut system\".\nThey found that the larger the \"contact angle\" between the curve of an individual bubble and the surface of the peanut was, the more likely it was to form and grow.\nBut it cannot grow too much\u2014a radius of under 1.3 millimeters is ideal, the study said.\nPereira said he hoped that \"by deeply researching this simple system, which everyone can grasp, we can understand a system\" that would be useful for industry or explaining natural phenomena.\nFor example, he said the floatation process was similar to the one used to separate iron from ore.\nAir is injected, in a controlled way, into a mixture in which a mineral\u2014such as iron\u2014\"will rise because bubbles attach themselves more easily to it, while other (minerals) sink to the bottom,\" he said.\nThe same process could also explain why volcanologists find that the mineral magnetite rises to higher layers in the crystallized magma of the Earth's crust than would be expected.\nLike peanuts, magnetite is denser, so should sit at the bottom. But due to a high contact angle, the researchers theorize, the mineral rises through the magma with help from gas bubbles.\nOf course, science is never settled\u2014particularly when beer is involved.\nHoping to create a better model of the dancing peanut phenomenon, Pereira said the scientists will continue to \"play with the characteristics of different peanuts and different beers\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLuiz Pereira et al, The physics of dancing peanuts in beer, Royal Society Open Science (2023).

Experiments are often time-consuming (Edison's team spent 14 months) and expensive (the winning combination cost about $850,000 in today's money).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpenses and time increase exponentially when developing the quantum materials that will revolutionize modern electronics and computing.\nTo make quantum material discovery possible, researchers turn to detailed databases as their virtual laboratory. A new database of understudied quantum materials that has been created by researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) provides an avenue to discover new materials that could power gadgets far more powerful than Edison's lightbulb.\nBeyond Edisonian trial and error\n\"We wanted to understand a general class of materials that have the same crystal structure, but different properties depending on how you combine and grow them,\" said materials scientist Tim Pope. This class of materials, known as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), contains thousands of potential combinations, each of which requires a weeks'-long reaction to grow flakes of material the size of glitter.\nMaking the material is only the first step in understanding what it can do. As PNNL computational scientist Micah Prange said, each flake is \"really small, really delicate,\" and quantum features will only emerge when studied at super-low temperatures. Essentially, \"a whole research program could go into each flake.\"\nDespite the difficulty of creating and measuring them, each combination holds promise to dramatically improve electronics, batteries, pollution remediation, and quantum computing devices.\n]Prange said you can think of the flakes as \"fancier graphene with a richer phenomenology and more practical possibilities.\" Tough, light, and flexible, graphene has been known as the material of the future, with uses in everything from aerospace to wearable electronics.\n\"The varied properties across this class of materials mean that as we better understand them, one of the combinations could be selected for a desired property and exactly paired to the ideal use,\" said Pope, \"or even a brand new application.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                Close up of a flake next to an image of its crystal structure overlaid with the model\u2019s predicted crystal structure. Credit: Tim Pope | Pacific Northwest National Laboratory\n             \n\n\nQuantum material development of the future\nBuilding the database began with PNNL's Chemical Dynamics Initiative, an effort to use PNNL's strength in data science to fill in knowledge gaps left by measurement challenges and experimental limitations.\nThese particular quantum materials are made by varying proportions of the 38 transition metals, like tungsten or vanadium, in combination with three elements in the sulfur family. They can also be grown in three different crystal structures, meaning there are thousands of potential combinations, all with distinct properties.\nUsing a type of modeling called density functional theory, the researchers computed the properties of 672 unique structures with a total of 50,337 individual atomic configurations. Before this research, there were fewer than 40 studied configurations, with only a rudimentary understanding of their properties.\n\"Models can work out the quantum mechanics of how atoms are arranged,\" said Prange. \"From this, you can say if the material will conduct electricity or be transparent or how hard the material will be to compress or bend.\"\nUsing the database, PNNL's researchers revealed striking differences in the electrical and magnetic behaviors between different combinations. Importantly, the researchers also found other trends as they varied the transition metal, including a new understanding of transition metal chemistry at the quantum level.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nQuantum combinations for machine learning\n\"When the crystal structure was overlaid with the database, it matched perfectly,\" said Pope, speaking of the PNNL-grown flakes that are beginning to validate the modeling results.\n\"The idea was really to develop a big data set of theoretical simulations so we could use data analytics to understand these materials,\" said Prange. \"The immediate value of the project is that we did enough different cases to efficiently use machine learning.\"\nThe open-source dataset, published in Scientific Data, offers researchers a strong starting point for exploring relationships between initial structures and corresponding properties. With this information, they can downselect to specific materials for study.\n\"This project is one example of how we can use a large computational dataset to guide the experimental research,\" said CDI Chief Scientist Peter Sushko, \"Projects like this provide critical data to the machine learning community and could streamline materials development.

   "text": "In the early 2000s, scientists from the UK made a worrisome discovery that the oceans are teeming with small particles of plastic (less than one millimeter in length) due to the continuous degradation of plastic waste. These microscopic particles of plastic have become a major environmental concern. Scientists classify these small particles as either microplastics or nanoplastics based on their size; the latter term is used exclusively for particles smaller than one micrometer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese particles easily get embedded into the bodies of marine and freshwater animals, which has raised alarms regarding the pervasive problem of micro- and nanoplastics pollution. Unfortunately, despite substantial efforts, researchers are yet to decipher the detailed mechanisms through which micro- and nanoplastics originate and change over time.\nThe issue lies mainly in the techniques that have been used so far to observe the degradation process of plastic particles. Simply put, these methods cannot observe the degradation into single particles in real time.\nAgainst this backdrop, a research team led by Associate Professor Daisuke Suzuki from Shinshu University in Japan set out to find a solution to this challenge. In their latest study, which was published in Soft Matter, they demonstrated an innovative approach to observe the degradation process of single microgel particles in real time with nanometric precision. The study was co-authored by Professor Takayuki Uchihashi from Nagoya University in Japan.\nThe proposed approach has two main lines of investigation. In the first part of the study, a microgel was used as a model for understanding the behavior of nanoplastic particles. The microgel employed was composed of a polymer with cross-linking points that could be cleaved via chemical reactions using an oxidizing agent. In other words, the bonds between the long fiber-like molecules that made up the tiny microgel spheres could be broken in a semi-controlled way by adjusting the temperature and the chemical environment.\nThe second main line of investigation of the study was the development of a state-of-the-art technique to visualize the degradation of the microgel in real time. The researchers employed a carefully configured high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) setup, which involved 'touching' the sample with an atomic-sized tip placed at the end of a cantilever and measuring its deflection. Thanks to HS-AFM, the team could observe the change in the shape of the microgel over time with extremely high precision.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nAfter several experiments at different temperatures and microgel compositions, the researchers gained valuable insight into how nanoplastics originate and evolve over time depending on their environment. \"The experiments revealed that while nanoplastics containing water easily allowed chemical reactants to diffuse inside, nanoplastics in a water-free state do not readily allow reactants to diffuse. Thus, nanoplastics in different states exhibited completely different degradation behaviors,\" explains Prof. Suzuki.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Soft Matter (2023). DOI: 10.1039/D3SM00216K\n\nThe videos of the microgels degrading in real time illustrate how useful this new approach could be to further the understanding of micro- and nanoplastics. Excited about the possible implications of their remarkable work, Prof. Suzuki comments, \"The presented approach has the potential to be expanded into an observation technique that can assess not only temperature variations, but also other external stimuli encountered in everyday life, such as ultraviolet light and stress, enabling nanoscale observations in diverse environmental conditions.\"\nOverall, the results of this study will pave the way to a better understanding of nanoplastics. In turn, this will give scientists and engineers a better chance at fighting this elusive facet of marine pollution.\nMoreover, since micro- and nanoplastics are essential materials used in everyday products like adhesives, paints, and cosmetics, having a firmer grasp on their degradation process will help devise guidelines to mitigate their environmental impact. Such knowledge would also be useful in advanced drug delivery systems, where gels play a pivotal role as delivery agents for drugs.\nProf. Suzuki concludes, \"This research will hopefully generate interest in micro- and nanoplastics among the general public, prompting them to reconsider their plastic usage, the primary source of nanoplastics.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYuichiro Nishizawa et al, Single microgel degradation governed by heterogeneous nanostructures, Soft Matter (2023).

This development has been published in the journal Optics Express and demonstrates that it is possible to print a polymer doped with liquid crystal, which opens the door to using this fast, high-precision and environmentally friendly technique in the manufacture of tunable devices.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs explained by the head of this research work, Professor Daniel Puerto, the development of this technology makes it possible to manufacture lenses with a material that changes its properties when an electrical voltage is applied to it, which opens up a wide range of possibilities for use in devices, microscopes or optical microdevices.\nThis work is the result of a collaboration led by the UA group, with the participation of researchers Sergi Gallego, Manuel Ortu\u00f1o, Andr\u00e9s M\u00e1rquez, Jorge Franc\u00e9s, Inmaculada Pascual and Augusto Bel\u00e9ndez. Also, researchers Catalin Constantinescu and Patricia Alloncle from the LP3 laboratory of the Center National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS, France) took part in this work, as well as researcher Camilo Florian from Princeton University (U.S.).\nThe use of materials whose optical properties are tunable is widespread in many communications devices to enable optical switching or multiplexing. The manufacturing of these devices is a time-consuming and cost-intensive process and, therefore, in the last twenty years, with the development of systems using ultra-short pulse lasers (10-12 to 10-15 seconds), laser processing techniques are being used to produce faster and more environmentally sustainable equipment.\nThe experience of the Holography and Optical Processing Group\u2014led by lecturers Augusto Bel\u00e9ndez and Inmaculada Pascual\u2014has opened up a new line of research in the manufacture of tunable devices such as lenses and waveguides manufactured by techniques such as laser printing.\nIn this sense, Daniel Puerto stresses that the use of polymer-based materials allows their use in technologies that are already being developed and that aim to make devices such as mobiles, tablets, etc. foldable. For this purpose, the use of flexible materials such as polymers are essential.\nAccording to the researcher, we have the perfect element for the development of the technology of the future If we want them to be tunable. The use of laser techniques for manufacturing optical and electronic devices is widespread, but it has not been possible to print polymers with liquid crystals so far, which opens a wide range of possibilities for the use of this technique.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel Puerto et al, Liquid crystal doped photopolymer micro-droplets printed by a simple and clean laser-induced forward transfer process, Optics Express (2023).

   "text": "Despite steady improvements in quantum computers, they're still noisy and error-prone, which leads to questionable or wrong answers. Scientists predict that they won't truly outcompete today's \"classical\" supercomputers for at least five or ten years, until researchers can adequately correct the errors that bedevil entangled quantum bits, or qubits.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut a new study shows that even lacking good error correction, there are ways to mitigate errors that could make quantum computers useful today.\nResearchers at IBM Quantum in New York and their collaborators at the University of California, Berkeley, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory report today (June 14) in the journal Nature that they pitted a 127-qubit quantum computer against a state-of-the-art supercomputer, and for at least one type of calculation, bested the supercomputer.\nThe calculation wasn't chosen because it was difficult for classical computers, the researchers say, but because it's similar to ones that physicists make all the time. Crucially, the calculation could be made increasingly complex in order to test whether today's noisy, error-prone quantum computers can produce accurate results for certain types of common calculations.\nThe fact that the quantum computer produced the verifiably correct solution as the calculation became more complex, while the supercomputer algorithm produced an incorrect answer, provides hope that quantum computing algorithms with error mitigation, instead of the more difficult error correction, could tackle cutting-edge physics problems, such as understanding the quantum properties of superconductors and novel electronic materials.\n\"We're entering the regime where the quantum computer might be able to do things that current algorithms on classical computers cannot do,\" said UC Berkeley graduate student and study co-author Sajant Anand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUC Berkeley\u2019s Sajant Anand and IBM researchers discuss a new study that shows error mitigation can give quantum computers an edge over supercomputers in some common physics calculations. Credit: IBM Research\n\n\"We can start to think of quantum computers as a tool for studying problems that we wouldn't be able to study otherwise,\" added Sarah Sheldon, senior manager for Quantum Theory and Capabilities at IBM Quantum.\nConversely, the quantum computer's trouncing of the classical computer could also spark new ideas to improve the quantum algorithms now used on classical computers, according to co-author Michael Zaletel, UC Berkeley associate professor of physics and holder of the Thomas and Alison Schneider Chair in Physics.\n\"Going into it, I was pretty sure that the classical method would do better than the quantum one,\" he said. \"So, I had mixed emotions when IBM's zero-noise extrapolated version did better than the classical method. But thinking about how the quantum system is working might actually help us figure out the right classical way to approach the problem. While the quantum computer did something that the standard classical algorithm couldn't, we think it's an inspiration for making the classical algorithm better so that the classical computer performs just as well as the quantum computer in the future.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nBoost the noise to suppress the noise\nOne key to the seeming advantage of IBM's quantum computer is quantum error mitigation, a novel technique for dealing with the noise that accompanies a quantum computation. Paradoxically, IBM researchers controllably increased the noise in their quantum circuit to get even noisier, less accurate answers and then extrapolated backward to estimate the answer the computer would have gotten if there had been no noise. This relies on having a good understanding of the noise that affects quantum circuits and predicting how it affects the output.\nThe problem of noise comes about because IBM's qubits are sensitive superconducting circuits that represent the zeroes and ones of a binary computation. When the qubits are entangled for a calculation, unavoidable annoyances such as heat and vibration can alter the entanglement, introducing errors. The greater the entanglement, the worse the effects of noise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantum computers have the potential to solve some of the world\u2019s biggest problems, but they are limited by their extreme sensitivity to errors caused by environmental noise. New research from IBM Quantum and UC Berkeley shows that a family of computational techniques called quantum error mitigation could allow quantum computers to solve useful problems at a scale far beyond the capability of even the most sophisticated classical supercomputing methods. Credit: IBM Research\n\nIn addition, computations that act on one set of qubits can introduce random errors in other, uninvolved qubits. Additional computations then compound these errors. Scientists hope to use extra qubits to monitor such errors so they can be corrected\u2014so-called fault-tolerant error correction. But achieving scalable fault-tolerance is a huge engineering challenge, and whether it will work in practice for ever greater numbers of qubits remains to be shown, Zaletel said.\nInstead, IBM engineers came up with a strategy of error mitigation they called zero noise extrapolation (ZNE), which uses probabilistic methods to controllably increase the noise on the quantum device. Based on a recommendation from a former intern, IBM researchers approached Anand, postdoctoral researcher Yantao Wu and Zaletel to ask their help in assessing the accuracy of the results obtained using this error mitigation strategy. Zaletel develops supercomputer algorithms to solve difficult calculations involving quantum systems, such as the electronic interactions in new materials. These algorithms, which employ tensor network simulations, can be directly applied to simulate interacting qubits in a quantum computer.\nOver a period of several weeks, Youngseok Kim and Andrew Eddins at IBM Quantum ran increasingly complex quantum calculations on the advanced IBM Quantum Eagle processor, and then Anand attempted the same calculations using state-of-the-art classical methods on the Cori supercomputer and Lawrencium cluster at Berkeley Lab and the Anvil supercomputer at Purdue University. When Quantum Eagle was rolled out in 2021, it had the highest number of high-quality qubits of any quantum computer, seemingly beyond the ability of classical computers to simulate.\nIn fact, exactly simulating all 127 entangled qubits on a classical computer would require an astronomical amount of memory. The quantum state would need to be represented by 2 to the power of 127 separate numbers. That's 1 followed by 38 zeroes; typical computers can store around 100 billion numbers, 27 orders of magnitude too small. To simplify the problem, Anand, Wu and Zaletel used approximation techniques that allowed them to solve the problem on a classical computer in a reasonable amount of time, and at a reasonable cost. These methods are somewhat like jpeg image compression, in that they get rid of less important information and keep only what's required to achieve accurate answers within the limits of the memory available.\nAnand confirmed the accuracy of the quantum computer's results for the less complex calculations, but as the depth of the calculations grew, the results of the quantum computer diverged from those of the classical computer. For certain specific parameters, Anand was able to simplify the problem and calculate exact solutions that verified the quantum calculations over the classical computer calculations. At the largest depths considered, exact solutions were not available, yet the quantum and classical results disagreed.\nThe researchers caution that while they can't prove that the quantum computer's final answers for the hardest calculations were correct, Eagle's successes on the previous runs gave them confidence that they were.\n\"The success of the quantum computer wasn't like a fine-tuned accident. It actually worked for a whole family of circuits it was being applied to,\" Zaletel said.\n\n\n\n\n\n                IBM\u2019s quantum computer is housed inside a cryogenic container (center) surrounded by a tangle of cables used to control and read out its qubits. Credit: IBM\n             \n\n\nFriendly competition\nWhile Zaletel is cautious about predicting whether this error mitigation technique will work for more qubits or calculations of greater depth, the results were nonetheless inspiring, he said.\n\"It sort of spurred a feeling of friendly competition,\" he said. \"I have a sense that we should be able to simulate on a classical computer what they're doing. But we need to think about it in a clever and better way\u2014the quantum device is in a regime where it suggests we need a different approach.\"\nOne approach is to simulate the ZNE technique developed by IBM.\n\"Now, we're asking if we can take the same error mitigation concept and apply it to classical tensor network simulations to see if we can get better classical results,\" Anand said. \"This work gives us the ability to maybe use a quantum computer as a verification tool for the classical computer, which is flipping the script on what's usually done.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYoungseok Kim et al, Evidence for the utility of quantum computing before fault tolerance, Nature (2023).

The two-dimensional material hBN is considered a remarkable host for color-center spin defects. The spin defects in hBN have attracted great attention with their advantages in two-dimensional quantum devices and integrated quantum nanodevices.\nAmong the discovered spin defects in hBN, the negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) defect is the most prevailing one. Researchers from Prof. Guo's team in their previous research conducted the measurement of temperature dependence based on the VB- defect and demonstrated the coherent dynamics of the multi-spin VB- center.\nThey found it hard to detect a single VB- defect for its low-quantum efficiency for the optical transition. Despite several reports of enhanced photoluminescence of the VB- defect, observing the coherent control of a single spin is still a challenge.\nIn this study, the researchers managed to isolate individual color centers in hBN powder samples with the help of capillary force. They discovered a class of ultrabright single-spin color centers with an excellent probability of 85%, which is enhanced by 21-fold compared with previous methods.\nThe researchers then measured its optical properties with significant antibunching characteristics and photon emissivity up to 25 MHz, which is the highest fluorescence count of single spin color centers found in hBN so far. They further captured its Rabi oscillation signal and conducted Hahn echo experiments. It was the first time that a single-spin color center in hBN was manipulated at room temperature, representing a new stage in the application of quantum information.\nMoreover, the researchers realized the first principles calculations to clarify the structure of this color-center defect. It was found that the complex of carbon-oxygen dopants may be the source of this type of single-spin color-center defects, and the simulated optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra of the CNCB3 model are consistent with the experimental results.\nThe coherent control of an ultrabright single spin in hBN at room temperature takes a leap in quantum areas, which provides a possibility for addressing spins that can be optically controlled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNai-Jie Guo et al, Coherent control of an ultrabright single spin in hexagonal boron nitride at room temperature, Nature Communications (2023).

   "text": "A team of physicists, including University of Massachusetts assistant professor Tigran Sedrakyan, recently announced in the journal Nature that they have discovered a new phase of matter. Called the \"chiral Bose-liquid state,\" the discovery opens a new path in the age-old effort to understand the nature of the physical world.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder everyday conditions, matter can be a solid, liquid or gas. But once you venture beyond the everyday\u2014into temperatures approaching absolute zero, things smaller than a fraction of an atom or which have extremely low states of energy\u2014the world looks very different. \"You find quantum states of matter way out on these fringes,\" says Sedrakyan, \"and they are much wilder than the three classical states we encounter in our everyday lives.\"\nSedrakyan has spent years exploring these wild quantum states, and he is particularly interested in the possibility of what physicists call \"band degeneracy,\" \"moat bands\" or \"kinetic frustration\" in strongly interacting quantum matter.\nTypically, particles in any system bump into each other, and in so doing they cause predictable effects, like billiard balls knocking into each other and then reacting in a predictable pattern. In other words, the effects and the particles are correlated. But in a frustrated quantum system, there are infinite possibilities that stem from the interaction of particles\u2014perhaps the billiard ball levitates or zooms off at an impossible angle\u2014and some of these infinite possibilities can lead to novel quantum states.\nWhat Sedrakyan and his colleagues have done is to engineer a frustration machine: a bilayer semiconducting device. The top layer is electron-rich, and these electrons can move freely. The bottom layer is filled with \"holes,\" or places that a roving electron can occupy. Then the two layers are brought extremely close together\u2014interatomic close.\nIf the number of electrons in the top layer and holes in the bottom layer were equal, then you would expect to see the particles acting in a correlated manner, but Sedrakyan and his colleagues designed the bottom layer so that there is a local imbalance between the number of electrons and holes in the bottom layer. \"It's like a game of musical chairs,\" Sedrakyan says, \"designed to frustrate the electrons. Instead of each electron having one chair to go to, they must now scramble and have many possibilities in where they 'sit.'\"\nThis frustration kicks off the novel chiral edge state, which has a number of surprising characteristics. For instance, if you cool quantum matter in a chiral state down to absolute zero, the electrons freeze into a predictable pattern, and the emergent charge-neutral particles in this state will all either spin clockwise or counterclockwise. Even if you smash another particle into one of these electrons, or you introduce a magnetic field, you can't alter its spin\u2014it's surprisingly robust and can even be used to encode digital data in a fault-tolerant way.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nEven more surprisingly is what happens when an outside particle does smash into one of the particles in the chiral edge state. To return to the billiard-ball metaphor, you would expect to send the eight-ball flying when the cue ball smacks into it. But if the pool balls were in a chiral Bose-liquid state, all 15 of them would react in exactly the same way when the eight-ball was struck. This effect is due to the long-range entanglement present in this quantum system.\nIt is difficult to observe the chiral Bose-liquid state, which is why it has remained hidden for so long. To do so, the team of scientists, including theoretical physicists Rui Wang and Baigeng Wang (both of Nanjing University) as well as experimental physicists Lingjie Du (Nanjing University) and Rui-Rui Du (Peking University) designed a theory and an experiment that used an extremely strong magnetic field that is capable of measuring the movements of the electrons as they race for chairs.\n\"On the edge of the semiconductor bilayer, electrons and holes move with the same velocities,\" says Lingjie Du. \"This leads to helical-like transport, which can be further modulated by external magnetic fields as the electron and hole channels are gradually separated under higher fields.\"\nThe magneto-transport experiments therefore successfully reveal the first piece of evidence of the chiral Bose-liquid, which the authors also call the \"excitonic topological order\" in the published paper.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRui-Rui Du, Excitonic topological order in imbalanced electron\u2013hole bilayers, Nature (2023).

In this original state of matter, the elementary quark and gluon particles move freely before forming protons, neutrons, or other strongly interacting particles.\nIn the early universe after the Big Bang, there was a very similar exotic state of matter lasting about ten microseconds, explains Georg Wolschin of Heidelberg University's Institute for Theoretical Physics. This state can be generated today using particle accelerators like the LHC very briefly for about 10-23 seconds but can only be observed indirectly rather than directly.\n\"During the collision of heavy ions, they are slowed down, and at the same time new elementary particles are created,\" explains Prof. Wolschin. Although the stopping process can be precisely measured at lower energies, until now it has not been possible to record the stopping of heavy ions at sufficiently small angles at the very high LHC acceleration energies.\nA measurement perpendicular to the beam as is possible already at the Large Hadron Collider is not sufficient to obtain a complete picture, explains the physicist. In collaboration with colleagues from Heidelberg and Japan, Georg Wolschin used a nonequilibrium-statistical model to predict how this stopping process could look.\nThe physicists based their calculations on a relativistic diffusion model. This model emerges from a nonequilibrium-statistical theory and is consistent with quantum chromodynamics\u2014the theory of strong interactions, which deals with one of the four fundamental forces of physics. The researchers first compared existing data from measurements at lower energies with their model.\n\"These data can be described well using our relativistic diffusion model,\" states Prof. Wolschin. On that basis it was then possible to derive theoretical predictions on the stopping behavior of heavy ions at the higher acceleration energies in the teraelectronvolt energy range at the LHC. However, to be able to compare them with data from experimental measurements first requires additional measurement equipment at the Large Hadron Collider, emphasizes the researcher.\nUsing their calculations, the researchers expect future experimental measurements at the Large Hadron Collider not only to confirm the predicted stopping behavior but also provide new insights into the properties of gluons. In quantum chromodynamics, these massless particles are the carrier particles of strong interaction.\nThey mediate the forces between quarks and are also indirectly responsible for the attraction between protons and neutrons in an atomic nucleus. Particle collisions in the LHC generate high temperatures, explains Georg Wolschin. In the process, gluons can interact with one another elastically, i.e. without changing the number of particles, or inelastically, i.e. generating or destroying particles.\n\"Through elastic interactions, a new state of matter, the gluon condensate, could in principle arise. It should be possible to derive the conditions under which this state can be achieved,\" explains the Heidelberg physicist.\nThe findings are published in the journal Physics Letters B.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohannes Hoelck et al, Limiting fragmentation in heavy-ion stopping?, Physics Letters B (2023).

   "text": "Researchers from the UvA Institute of Physics and ENS de Lyon have discovered how to design materials that necessarily have a point or line where the material doesn't deform under stress, and that even remember how they have been poked or squeezed in the past. These results could be used in robotics and mechanical computers, while similar design principles could be used in quantum computers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outcome is a breakthrough in the field of metamaterials: designer materials whose responses are determined by their structure rather than their chemical composition. To construct a metamaterial with mechanical memory, physicists Xiaofei Guo, Marcelo Guzm\u00e1n, David Carpentier, Denis Bartolo and Corentin Coulais realized that its design needs to be \"frustrated,\" and that this frustration corresponds to a new type of order, which they call non-orientable order.\nPhysics with a twist\nA simple example of a non-orientable object is a M\u00f6bius strip, made by taking a strip of material, adding half a twist to it and then gluing its ends together. You can try this at home with a strip of paper. Following the surface of a M\u00f6bius strip with your finger, you'll find that when you get back to your starting point, your finger will be on the other side of the paper.\nA M\u00f6bius strip is non-orientable because there is no way to label the two sides of the strip in a consistent manner; the twist makes the entire surface one and the same. This is in contrast to a simple cylinder (a strip without any twists whose ends are glued together), which has a distinct inner and outer surface.\nGuo and her colleagues realized that this non-orientability strongly affects how an object or metamaterial responds to being pushed or squeezed. If you place a simple cylinder and a M\u00f6bius strip on a flat surface and press down on them from above, you'll find that the sides of the cylinder will all bulge out (or in), while the sides of the M\u00f6bius strip cannot do the same. Instead, the non-orientability of the latter ensures that there is always a point along the strip where it does not deform under pressure.\nFrustration is not always a bad thing\nExcitingly, this behavior extends far beyond M\u00f6bius strips.\n\"We discovered that the behavior of non-orientable objects such as M\u00f6bius strips allows us to describe any material that is globally frustrated. These materials naturally want to be ordered, but something in their structure forbids the order to span the whole system and forces the ordered pattern to vanish at one point or line in space. There is no way to get rid of that vanishing point without cutting the structure, so it has to be there no matter what,\" explains Coulais, who leads the Machine Materials Laboratory at the University of Amsterdam.\nThe research team designed and 3D-printed their own mechanical metamaterial structures which exhibit the same frustrated and non-orientable behavior as M\u00f6bius strips. Their designs are based on rings of squares connected by hinges at their corners. When these rings are squeezed, neighboring squares will rotate in opposite directions so that their edges move closer together. The opposite rotation of neighbors makes the system's response analogous to the anti-ferromagnetic ordering that occurs in certain magnetic materials.\nRings composed of an odd number of squares are frustrated, because there is no way for all neighboring squares to rotate in opposite directions. Squeezed odd-numbered rings therefore exhibit non-orientable order, in which the rotation angle at one point along the ring must go to zero.\nBeing a feature of the overall shape of the material makes this a robust topological property. By connecting multiple metarings together, it is even possible to emulate the mechanics of higher-dimensional topological structures such as the Klein bottle.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nMechanical memory \nHaving an enforced point or line of zero deformation is key to endowing materials with mechanical memory. Instead of squeezing a metamaterial ring from all sides, you can press the ring at distinct points. Doing so, the order in which you press different points determines where the zero deformation point or line ends up.\nThis is a form of storing information. It can even be used to execute certain types of logic gates, the basis of any computer algorithm. A simple metamaterial ring can thus function as a mechanical computer.\nBeyond mechanics, the results of the study suggest that non-orientability could be a robust design principle for metamaterials that can effectively store information across scales, in fields as diverse as colloidal science, photonics, magnetism, and atomic physics. It could even be useful for new types of quantum computers.\nCoulais concludes, \"Next, we want to exploit the robustness of the vanishing deformations for robotics. We believe the vanishing deformations could be used to create robotic arms and wheels with predictable bending and locomotion mechanisms.\"\nThe research is published in the journal Nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tXiaofei Guo, Non-orientable order and non-commutative response in frustrated metamate, Nature (2023).

But due to a high contact angle, the researchers theorize, the mineral rises through the magma with help from gas bubbles.\nOf course, science is never settled\u2014particularly when beer is involved.\nHoping to create a better model of the dancing peanut phenomenon, Pereira said the scientists will continue to \"play with the characteristics of different peanuts and different beers\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLuiz Pereira et al, The physics of dancing peanuts in beer, Royal Society Open Science (2023).

In contrast, QOs are usually absent for insulators due to the zero density of state in the gap.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA team led by Dr. Yang Wei and Dr. Zhang Guangyu from the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) reported the observation of anomalous quantum oscillations of correlated insulators in twisted double-bilayer graphene. Their paper, entitled \"Quantum oscillations in field-induced correlated insulators of a moir\u00e9 superlattice,\" was published in Science Bulletin.\nGraphene-based moir\u00e9 superlattices, which consist of two pieces of single or multilayer graphene stacked at a twisted angle, are known to host moir\u00e9 flat bands and correlated states. A typical example is twisted double-bilayer graphene (2+2), whose band structure can be further tuned by electric field in addition to the twist angle, thus allowing tuning of flat bands and correlation strength in situ.\nIn this study, the researchers observed the spin-polarized and valley-polarized correlated insulators when the moir\u00e9 bands were half filled in 2+2. With its highly tunable nature, 2+2 provides a new platform for discovering new exotic phases in the correlated insulating states.\n\n\n\n\n\n                vidence of Metal to insulator transition and insulating behavior of the quantum oscillations. Credit: YANG Wei\n             \n\n\nThe team has long been devoted to exploring the quantum transport behavior in moir\u00e9 superlattices. Previously, they found that new correlated insulators with valley polarizations appear at half fillings of energy bands in twisted double bilayer graphene, thanks to the orbital Zeeman effect in perpendicular magnetic field.\nTo their surprise, they found that the resistance of correlated insulators in 2+2 oscillates periodically with the inverse of the magnetic field, similar to the Shubnikov de Haas oscillations in metal. The bulk insulating evidence of the QOs is revealed in the high oscillation amplitude of ~150 k\u03a9 and its temperature dependence, as well as the antiphase behavior.\nMoreover, the insulating QOs are strongly tunable by electric field. The carrier density extracted from the 1/B periodicity decreases almost linearly with D from -0.7 to -1.1V/nm, suggesting a reduced Fermi surface; the effective mass from the Lifshitz-Kosevich analysis depends nonlinearly on perpendicular electrical displacement field (D), reaching a minimum value of 0.1me at D = ~ -1.0V/nm.\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Electrical field tunable quantum oscillations.

   "text": "A study developed by researchers from the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia (UPV), associated with the Nanophotonics Technology Center (NTC) and the company DAS Photonics, promises to revolutionize the design of so-called invisibility cloaks. With their proposal, these cloaks will no longer be so invisible. And the key is simple: applying diffraction tomography techniques to detect these devices. Their work has been published in the journal Laser & Photonics Reviews.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Valencian researchers, invisibility cloaks have become one of the most prominent advances among the wide range of applications in the field of metamaterials. Until now, most of the efforts in invisibility science have been devoted to achieving practically realizable cloak designs and improving the efficiency of these devices.\n\"However, little attention has been paid to the opposite side of the technology: the development of more effective techniques for detecting such invisibility devices. This is the focus of our study, which will rethink the design of these cloaks, as it will significantly facilitate their detection. And all thanks to diffraction tomography,\" explains Carlos Garc\u00eda Meca, Research Director at DAS Photonics.\nRegarding the applications of the proposal emerging from the NTC laboratories, the team of Valencian researchers stresses that it would cover multiple fields.\n\"One of them would be the ability to ensure the proper use of the electromagnetic spectrum to allow the detection of the presence of hostile agents, despite the use of countermeasures by the latter to avoid it. Consider, for example, a soldier using an invisibility cloak to conceal a small observation post and remain undetected by standard detection methods. The technique we have developed would make it possible to identify him,\" explains Carlos Garc\u00eda Meca.\nMuch more information thanks to tomography\nSo far, evaluating the performance of invisibility cloaks is based solely on adding up all the energy re-emitted by the cloak when it is illuminated. \"What is done is to estimate all that energy re-emitted in all possible directions, so the resulting value determines the cloak's performance. If the number is deficient, the layer is considered very good; if it re-emits a lot, it does not make the object to be hidden invisible,\" explains Fran D\u00edaz, a researcher at the UPV's Nanophotonic Technology Centre.\nThe proposal presented in their study by the NTC-DAS team provides much more information about the layers. The tomography sheds light on the optical properties of the analyzed area. Using different illumination angles, this technique intelligently processes previously ignored information (phase and scattered field distribution), thus obtaining a map of the object's refractive index.\n\"In this way, we drastically improve detection sensitivity, and we can even image the invisibility cloaks, with their size and shape. This makes the cloaks more easily detectable. Therefore, with this technique, invisibility cloaks are no longer so invisible,\" says Fran D\u00edaz.\nAccording to the Valencian researchers, this method could also be extended to detect acoustic invisibility cloaks. The team's work from the Nanophotonics Technology Centre of the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia and DAS Photonics has also been selected for the inside cover of Laser & Photonics Reviews.\nMore applications in electronic warfare and biomedical imaging\nSince diffraction tomography represents a much more demanding test for evaluating the performance of invisibility cloaks, this new detection technique could lay the foundation for a unique design and characterization standard for such devices.\nMoreover, this new finding opens up a range of potential benefits in various fields, from fundamental advances in invisibility science to technological applications in signal intelligence and electronic warfare and even biomedical imaging. In this sense, the study by DAS Photonics and UPV researchers suggests that invisibility layers based on so-called \"scatter cancelation\" could be applied to improve the resolution of tomographic techniques when imaging clusters of small particles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrancisco J.

Magnetoelectric-based control methods in insulating multiferroic materials require less energy and have potential for high-speed, low-power information storage applications. BiFeO3 is a room-temperature multiferroic material with potential for use in spintronics devices, but its weak ferromagnetic and magnetoelectric effects and high voltage required for manipulation are weaknesses.\nIn this study, the researchers grew single crystals of the multiferroic 0.58BiFeO3-0.42Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 (BF-BKT), which lies in the tetragonal region adjacent to the MPB.\n\"Below the N\u00e9el temperature, TN~257.5 K, the BF-BKT crystals showed antiferromagnetic behavior,\" said Yin, \"and at room temperature, we found that the BF-BKT crystals exhibited both short-range magnetic order and long-range ferroelectric order.\"\nAt room temperature, the multiferroic BF-BKT single crystals exhibited substantial and consistent control of magnetism with E, where the magnitude of E was significantly smaller than the ferroelectric coercive field.\nIn addition, high magnetic fields (H) could significantly reduce the degree of E control over magnetism.\nIt was found that the coupling between magnetism and ferroelectricity in the BF-BKT material can be attributed to both lattice distortion and phase transformation induced by an external E, rather than just ferroelectric domain switching. At high values of H, the converse magnetoelectric effect is weakened due to the suppression of phase transformation caused by the magnetic field.\nThese results suggest that designing devices based on multiferroics near the MPB could be an effective way to achieve E control of magnetism and even possible low-E switching of magnetism for low-power spintronic applications.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLi-Hua Yin et al, Control of magnetism at low electric fields in multiferroic 0.58BiFeO3-0.42Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 single crystal near morphotropic phase boundary, Acta Materialia (2023).

An increased flow rate led to less deposition, and the largest (5.56 micron) microplastics were deposited in the airways more often than their smaller counterparts.\nThe authors believe their study highlights the real concern of exposure to and inhalation of microplastics, particularly in areas with high levels of plastic pollution or industrial activity.

This milestone not only sets a new world record for non-relay QKD but also provides a solution for high-speed intercity quantum communication.

When combined with the \"one-time pad\" encryption method, it can achieve the highest level of security for confidential communication. However, the distance of QKD has been limited by factors such as the channel loss and system noise.\nThe twin-field QKD (TF-QKD) using sending-or-not-sending (SNS) protocol was demonstrated in the experiment, improving the relation between the key rate and channel transmittance from a linear \u03b7 to its square root \u03b7. Therefore, it can achieve a much longer secure distance than traditional QKD protocols.\nTo achieve long-distance QKD, the research team collaborated with Yangtze Optical Fiber and Cable Joint Stock Limited Company (YOFC) and used ultra-low-loss fiber based on pure silica core technology, which achieved a maximum attenuation of 0.16 dB/km. SIMIT developed ultra-low-noise superconducting single-photon detectors.\nBy implementing multiple filters at temperatures of 40 K and 2.2 K to suppress dark counts caused by thermal radiation, the noise of the single-photon detectors was reduced to around 0.02 cps. Furthermore, the team also developed a dual-band phase estimation scheme to avoid the spontaneous Raman scattering noise, reducing the system noise to below 0.01 Hz.\nBased on the aforementioned technological developments, the team achieved TF-QKD over a record distance of 1,002 km, with a key rate of 0.0034 bps. This work not only verifies the feasibility of the SNS-TF-QKD scheme at extremely long distances but also demonstrates that this protocol can achieve high key rates in many practical scenarios.\nThe success of this study holds significant implications for the advancement of secure quantum communication.

   "text": "Shape memory alloys (SMA) remember their original shape and return to it after being heated. Similar to how a liquid transforms into a gas when boiled, SMAs undergo a phase transformation when heated or cooled. The phase transformation occurs with the movement of atoms, which is invisible to the naked eye.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMAs are utilized in a diverse array of applications, including as actuators and sensors. However, the need to cool or heat SMAs means there is a delay in their phase transformation.\nAs a recently invented type of SMA, metamagnetic shape memory alloys (MMSMA) negate this limited response rate due to their ability to undergo phase transformation when exposed to an external magnetic field. Yet to date, MMSMAs have failed to solve another common problem with most SMAs: the fact that they lose a large amount of energy when phase transforming, and this worsens substantially in low temperatures.\nNow, a research group from Tohoku University has made a significant breakthrough by developing a palladium-based (Pd) MMSMA that exhibits low energy loss. Even at low temperatures of about 100 K this energy loss was lowered to only about 1/100 when compared to existing MMSMAs. Details of the group's research were published in the journal Advanced Science on June 13, 2023.\n\"We were astonished at the small energy loss in our new Pd-based alloy. Thus, our study also sought to answer two questions. How does the energy loss behave when the temperature lowers even further, such as at the liquid-helium temperature (4.2 K), and why did our material exhibit such a small energy loss?\" said Xiao Xu, corresponding author of the paper and assistant professor at Tohoku University's Graduate School of Engineering.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Magnetostriction properties of the current Pd-based alloy at low temperatures. Credit: Advanced Science (2023). DOI: 10.1002/advs.202207779\n             \n\n\nTo answer these questions, Xu and his colleagues at Tohoku University's Institute for Materials Research (IMR) teamed up with the University of Tokyo's Institute for Solid State Physics (ISSP). They first conducted magnetization measurements by using pulsed high magnetic fields at liquid-helium temperature. Much like previous SMAs, the newly developed Pd-based SMA also demonstrated an increase in energy loss as the temperature dropped. But the energy loss was still significantly smaller than current SMAs.\nThe group then performed X-ray diffraction measurements, both at low temperatures and under strong magnetic fields, revealing that the new Pd-base alloy had better lattice compatibility for phase transformation. The crystals within the structures could change easier and this explained why it displayed a smaller energy loss compared to existing SMAs.\n\"We are also surprised to see that our Pd-based alloy can show a large magnetostriction (the ability to change the dimension when an external magnetic field is present) comparable to rare-earth materials at low temperatures.

Through entanglement distribution and Bell-state measurement, quantum teleportation enables the nonlocal transmission of an unknown quantum state, which has deepened the understanding of quantum entanglement. More importantly, quantum teleportation can effectively overcome the distance limitation of direct transmission of quantum states in quantum communication, as well as realize long-range interactions between different quantum bits in quantum computing.\nThe team has been at the forefront of experimental studies on high-dimensional quantum teleportation and quantum networks. Their notable achievements include the successful preparation of the world's highest fidelity 32-dimensional quantum entanglement, the effective transmission of high-dimensional entanglement over 11 kilometers of optical fiber, and the development of efficient techniques for quantum entanglement detection. They have also made significant progress in areas such as high-dimensional quantum dense coding, high-dimensional quantum guidance, and high-dimensional quantum teleportation.\nTeleportation has advanced a lot in both theoretical research and experimental verification.

They can capture fast changes in materials invisible to other types of radiation. Scientists can now use terahertz waves to record real-time movies of hot electrons in silicon at 50,000 frames per second\u2014faster than ever before.\nLed by Jean-Michel M\u00e9nard, associate professor of physics at the University of Ottawa's Faculty of Science, a team of scientists used two techniques, chirped-pulse encoding and photonic time-stretch.\nThe study, \"Single-pulse terahertz spectroscopy monitoring sub-millisecond time dynamics at a rate of 50\u2009kHz,\" was published in Nature Communications.\nThe first technique imprints the information carried by a THz pulse onto a chirped supercontinuum in the optical region, which resembles a traveling rainbow. The second stretches the rainbow pulse in time inside a long fiber, slowing down the rate of information so that it can be recorded in real time by advanced electronic equipment. These steps are repeated using a train of pulses at 20 microsecond-intervals, which can be combined to make a movie of the low-energy dynamics inside a material.\n\"In this study, we present a novel photonics system that can measure in real time the low-energy dynamics of complex physical phenomena with a time resolution approaching the microsecond. Our setup is distinctive: It is a compact system that replaces a technology that was only accessible in large synchrotron facilities, and can quickly perform time-resolved THz spectroscopy, a powerful technique to analyze various materials,\" says M\u00e9nard.\nWhat's next?\nExperiments relying on this system will trace vibrational resonances of molecules to study the enigmatic role of enzymes in chemical reactions and observe invisible changes in living organisms when they're exposed to a sudden rise in temperature.\n\"In condensed matter experiments, our rapid THz photonic system will be used to observe a range of non-reversible electronic or lattice reconfigurations, notably occurring during phase transitions,\" says M\u00e9nard. \"We anticipate that (this) will play a crucial role in revealing a new range of fast and non-reproducible processes rendering THz spectroscopy an even more efficient characterization tool to make impactful discoveries in materials physics.\"\nThe researchers' photonic system allows them for the first time to investigate behaviors of irreversible physical, chemical and biological phenomena, including electronic transport in semiconductors, chemical exothermic reactions and protein folding in biological systems.

   "text": "In the world of optics, capturing high-dimensional optical information is crucial for understanding and characterizing various targets across different scenes. This includes important aspects like irradiance, spectrum, space, polarization, and phase. However, finding a single system that can gather all this information efficiently\u2014while also being lightweight, portable and cost-effective\u2014is quite challenging.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter compressive full-Stokes spectropolarimetric imaging (SPI)\u2014a powerful technique that integrates a passive polarization modulator (PM) into a general imaging spectrometer. This approach allows high-dimensional information to be captured from incomplete measurements. The only catch is the need for a reconstruction algorithm to recover the 3D data cubes (x, y, and \u03bb) for each Stokes parameter describing the state of electromagnetic radiation. Unfortunately, existing PMs are complex and require accurate polarization calibration, and current reconstruction algorithms often suffer from poor image quality and are sensitive to noise.\nFortunately, a team of researchers from Xi'an Jiaotong University in China has come up with an innovative solution. As reported in Advanced Photonics Nexus, they have developed a passive spectropolarimetric modulation technique using a single multiple-order retarder followed by a polarizer. Creating a unified forward imaging model for SPI, they propose a reconstruction algorithm that combines deep image prior and sparsity prior. The best part is that their method doesn't require training data or accurate polarization calibration, and it can simultaneously reconstruct the 3D data cubes while achieving self-calibration. This new approach, called DIP-SP, is highly robust against noise and significantly improves the quality of the reconstructed images.\nTo demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of their technique, the researchers integrated the simplest PM into a miniature snapshot imaging spectrometer, creating a single-shot SPI prototype. Through simulations and experiments, they have shown that their SPI scheme outperforms existing methods. The beauty of their approach is that it allows general spectral imaging systems to become passive full-Stokes SPI systems without altering their intrinsic mechanisms.\nThe advantages of the DIP-SP method are manifold. First, it enables the implementation of the simplest passive PM scheme, making encoding and decoding feasible. Second, it eliminates the need for additional training data and can be applied to diverse applications. Third, it also eliminates the time-consuming search for a scene-dependent regularization parameter required in other methods. Fourth, the output of the neural network is physically constrained and interpretable, thanks to the use of the forward-imaging model. Lastly, accurate calibration of the measurement matrix is not necessary, and rough preliminary polarization calibration is acceptable. This method also has the potential to be adapted to other PM schemes by modifying the measurement matrix.\nThis proposed SPI scheme can be used in industrial inspection and machine vision, where snapshot capabilities are often required, and it also has potential applications in surveillance using micro unmanned aerial vehicles or ground vehicles. In the field of biomedical diagnosis, it can be conveniently adapted to various commercial microscopies such as fluorescence microscopy, confocal microscopy, ophthalmoscopes, endoscopes, and laryngoscopes.\nOverall, the innovative DIP-SP method opens exciting possibilities for the development of miniature SPI systems, utilizing both free-space optical components and chip-scale integration with silicon photonic circuits or metasurfaces. Its simplicity, effectiveness, and broad range of applications make it a significant advancement in the field of optical imaging.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFeng Han et al, Deep image prior plus sparsity prior: toward single-shot full-Stokes spectropolarimetric imaging with a multiple-order retarder, Advanced Photonics Nexus (2023).

   "text": "Researchers from the Professorship of Optics and Photonics of Condensed Matter, headed by Prof. Dr. Carsten Deibel, of Chemnitz University of Technology and other partner institutions are currently working together on solar cells made of novel organic semiconductors, which can be manufactured using established printing or thermal evaporation methods.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to fundamentally understand and further develop this class of photovoltaic materials, the researchers are pursuing a strongly interdisciplinary approach as part of the research unit \"Printed & Stable Organic Photovoltaics from Non-fullerene Acceptors\u2014POPULAR.\" Here, expertise from chemistry and materials science, as well as physics and mathematics, is combined with printing technology.\n\"With regard to the development of resource-efficient renewable energies, research on organic photovoltaics is extremely relevant, as they can be processed at high throughput at room temperature,\" says Deibel, who is also the head of the research group POPULAR.\n\"Organic semiconductors are very good light absorbers, so the light-absorbing layer in solar cells is 1,000 times thinner than in crystalline silicon solar cells,\" says the Chemnitz physics professor. In contrast to the latter, organic solar cells are not highly ordered, but disordered. \"For the transport of the electrons and holes generated in organic semiconductors by sunlight, this means they do not move on a highway, but on a bumpy road with many traps that catch electrons or holes and lead to a slower, but not lower, current flow,\" explains Deibel. One way to describe this energetic landscape is the density of states.\nSurprising insight: Power law describes the density of states of organic solar cells\nTo better understand charge transport in organic solar cells, Deibel and his research assistant Maria Saladina, together with colleagues from the University of Nuremberg-Erlangen, the Helmholtz Institute Erlangen-Nuremberg for Renewable Energy, and Heliatek GmbH in Dresden, manufactured different types of organic solar cells, analyzed them and for the first time uncovered the electronic defect landscape. This is the result of sensitive measurements of the open-circuit voltage of the organic solar cells\u2014the voltage that is generated when no current is flowing, and which is a measure of how much energy the photo-generated electrons and holes have.\nThe measurements were made under a wide range of light intensities and temperatures. The evaluation of the data showed that the density of states of the organic solar cells has a shape that cannot be described\u2014as previously assumed\u2014by a Gaussian or exponential distribution, but by a power law. \"This means that, contrary to older models, smaller open-circuit voltages in the solar cells lie in an energetic range where there are more traps. Fortunately, under working conditions of organic solar cells at room temperature under sunlight irradiation, the open-circuit voltage is higher and the density of states contains fewer traps,\" says Saladina.\nThe research results were published in Physical Review Letters and the manuscript was selected as an Editors' Suggestion. Although the theoretical description of organic solar cells must be reconsidered due to these new insights, the authors of the technical article estimate that there is no fundamental obstacle to the production of highly efficient organic solar cells using printing or evaporation technologies.\n\"We are convinced that the disordered nature of organic semiconductors for solar cells is directly linked to the mass-production-compatible manufacturing possibilities,\" says Deibel.\nSaladina adds, \"We have realized that the density of states, which determines the processes of charge transport and recombination in organic solar cells, is more complex than previously assumed.\" The challenges associated with this will also be faced by the DFG research unit POPULAR and the Marie-Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Ph.D. network EIFFEL.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMaria Saladina et al, Power-Law Density of States in Organic Solar Cells Revealed by the Open-Circuit Voltage Dependence of the Ideality Factor, Physical Review Letters (2023).

They argued for the existence of \"elements of reality\" that were not part of quantum theory\u2014and then went further by speculating that it should be possible to come up with a new theory that would contain such hidden variables.\nTheir experiment has since come to be known as the EPR paradox because of the contradictions it reveals, such as one particle in a system influencing other particles due to entanglement, and also that it can become possible to know more about the particles in a given system than should be allowed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\nSeveral years later, John Bell developed what has come to be known as the Bell test as a means of testing the EPR paradox\u2014up until now, it has involved small entangled systems using pairs of photons or atoms. In this new effort, the research team has shown that the same sort of experiment can be scaled up to a larger system using Bose-Einstein condensates.\nIn their experiment, the group began by generating a cloud made up of rubidium-87 atoms. They then generated an interaction between the atoms in the cloud forcing them to become an entangled Bose-Einstein condensate. They then released the condensate into two separate clouds where the pseudospins were entangled. They concluded by measuring the \"pseudospins\" of the two clouds\u2014each of which held hundreds of rubidium-87 atoms\u2014independently. They found that the properties of the two clouds could not be correlated in a way attributable to chance and thus that the EPR paradox holds even when scaled up.\nThe research group suggests that in addition to their findings, the experiment could serve as a template for conducting other quantum metrology applications.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPaolo Colciaghi et al, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Experiment with Two Bose-Einstein Condensates, Physical Review X (2023).

   "text": "A group of researchers from Tohoku University has unveiled a new material that exhibits enormous magnetoresistance, paving the way for developments in non-volatile magnetoresistive memory (MRAM).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails of their unique discovery were published in the Journal of Alloys and Compounds.\nToday, the demand for advancements in hardware that can efficiently process large amounts of digital information and in sensors has never been greater, especially with governments deploying technological innovations to achieve smarter societies.\nMuch of this hardware and sensors rely on MRAM and magnetic sensors, and tunnel magnetoresistive devices make up the majority of such devices.\nTunnel magnetoresistive devices exploit the tunnel magnetoresistance effect to detect and measure magnetic fields. This is tied to the magnetization of ferromagnetic layers in magnetic tunnel junctions. When the magnets are aligned, a low resistance state is observed, and electrons can easily tunnel through the thin insulating barrier between them.\nWhen the magnets are not aligned, the tunneling of electrons becomes less efficient and leads to higher resistance. This change in resistance is expressed as the magnetoresistive ratio, a key figure in determining the efficiency of tunneling magnetoresistive devices. The higher the magnetoresistance ratio, the better the device is.\nCurrent tunnel magnetoresistive devices comprise magnesium oxide and iron-based magnetic alloys, like iron-cobalt. Iron-based alloys have a body-centered cubic crystal structure in ambient conditions and exhibit a huge tunnel magnetoresistance effect in devices with a rock salt-type magnesium oxide.\n\n\n\n\n\n                The thermodynamically stable crystal structure in cobalt-manganese-iron ternary alloys which displays the composition of the material in which the huge magnetoresistance ratio was discovered, and the magnetoresistance data collected at low and room temperature. These characteristics were obtained due to the body-centered cubic structure in a metastable state. Credit: Tohoku University\n             \n\n\nThere have been two notable studies using these iron-based alloys that produced magnetoresistive devices displaying high magnetoresistance ratios. The first in 2004 was by the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan and IBM; and the second came in 2008, when researchers from Tohoku University reported on a magnetoresistance ratio exceeding 600% at room temperature, something that jumped to 1000% with temperatures near zero Kelvin.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nSince those breakthroughs, various institutes and companies have invested considerable effort in honing device physics, materials, and processes. Yet aside from iron-based alloys, only some Heusler-type ordered magnetic alloys have displayed such enormous magnetoresistance.\nDr. Tomohiro Ichinose and Professor Shigemi Mizukami from Tohoku University recently began exploring thermodynamically metastable materials to develop a new material capable of demonstrating similar magnetoresistance ratios. To do so, they focused on the strong magnetic properties of cobalt-manganese alloys, which have a body-centered cubic metastable crystal structure.\n\"Cobalt-manganese alloys have face-centered cubic or hexagonal crystal structures as thermodynamically stable phases. Because this stable phase exhibits weak magnetism, it has never been studied as a practical material for tunnel magnetoresistive devices,\" said Mizukami.\nBack in 2020, the group reported on a device that used a cobalt-manganese alloy with metastable body-centered cubic crystal structure.\nUsing data science and/or high-throughput experimental methods, they built upon this discovery, and succeeded in obtaining huge magnetoresistance in devices by adding a small amount of iron to the metastable body-centered cubic cobalt-manganese alloy. The magnetoresistance ratio was 350% at room temperature and also exceeded 1000% at a low temperature. Additionally, the device fabrication employed the sputtering method and a heating process, something compatible with current industries.\n\"We have produced the third instance of a new magnetic alloy for tunneling magnetoresistive devices showing huge magnetoresistance, and it sets an alternative direction of travel for future improvements,\" adds Mizukami.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTomohiro Ichinose et al, Large tunnel magnetoresistance in magnetic tunnel junctions with magnetic electrodes of metastable body-centered cubic CoMnFe alloys, Journal of Alloys and Compounds (2023).

He was joined by colleagues from CNR-IOM Trieste, Ca' Foscari University of Venice, University of Milan, University of W\u00fcrzburg (Germany), University of St. Andrews (UK), Boston College and University of Santa Barbara (U.S.).\nThrough advanced experimental techniques, using light generated by a particle accelerator, the Synchrotron, and thanks to modern techniques for modeling the behavior of matter, the scholars were able to measure electron spin for the first time, related to the concept of topology.\n\"If we take two objects such as a football and a doughnut, we notice that their specific shapes determine different topological properties, for example because the doughnut has a hole, while the football does not,\" Domenico Di Sante explains. \"Similarly, the behavior of electrons in materials is influenced by certain quantum properties that determine their spinning in the matter in which they are found, similar to how the trajectory of light in the universe is modified by the presence of stars, black holes, dark matter, and dark energy, which bend time and space.\"\nAlthough this characteristic of electrons has been known for many years, no one had until now been able to measure this \"topological spin\" directly. To achieve this, the researchers exploited a particular effect known as \"circular dichroism\": a special experimental technique that can only be used with a synchrotron source, which exploits the ability of materials to absorb light differently depending on their polarization.\nScholars have especially focused on \"kagome materials,\" a class of quantum materials that owe their name to their resemblance to the weave of interwoven bamboo threads that make up a traditional Japanese basket (called, indeed, \"kagome\"). These materials are revolutionizing quantum physics, and the results obtained could help us learn more about their special magnetic, topological, and superconducting properties.\n\"These important results were possible thanks to a strong synergy between experimental practice and theoretical analysis,\" adds Di Sante. \"The team's theoretical researchers employed sophisticated quantum simulations, only possible with the use of powerful supercomputers, and in this way guided their experimental colleagues to the specific area of the material where the circular dichroism effect could be measured.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDomenico Di Sante et al, Flat band separation and robust spin Berry curvature in bilayer kagome metals, Nature Physics (2023).

The discovery has a disruptive potential for applications in photonics with complex light, such as time-resolved microscopy (useful, for example, to produce movies depicting the motion of molecules and viruses), laser-plasma acceleration and free-space (e.g., in the atmosphere) optical communications.\nThe research is published in Nature Photonics.\nIn ultrafast optics, it is possible to shorten or elongate the duration of extremely short optical pulses\u2014down to a few femtoseconds, or thousandths of billionths of a second\u2014or even produce complex pulses, by means of a technique known as pulse shaping. A central idea to this principle is that short laser pulses are composed of a large range of colors.\nScientists separate a pulse into its constituent colors, which are then separately manipulated and recombined, resulting in a new shape of the laser pulse. While pulse shaping allows to manipulate the time profile of a pulse, there is another set of techniques\u2014known as wavefront shaping\u2014allowing to give light a spatial structure. Designers of light have learnt how to combine these two methods to simultaneously shape light in space and time, bridging ultrafast optics and structured light for entirely new spatiotemporal applications.\nA paradigm shift in spatiotemporal light shaping\nReporting now in Nature Photonics, Piccardo and his collaborators have introduced a paradigm shift in spatiotemporal light shaping. Unlike conventional shapers that separate different colors along a colorful strip, now the researchers used a special type of diffraction grating with circular symmetry, to create a round rainbow of colors.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an experiment that everyone can try at home: by shining a flashlight on an old CD-ROM and taking a picture with the phone camera, a round rainbow will be captured. Now, replace the flashlight with an ultrashort laser pulse and the CD-ROM with a microstructured diffractive device fabricated in the nanofabrication cleanroom and you are halfway through the experiment. The second part of the experiment consists in using advanced holograms to structure the many colors of light into different optical vortices shaped like a corkscrew.\n\"This results in a novel family of spatiotemporal light beams, which evolve on an ultrashort femtosecond timescale with a twisted and widely tailorable light structure,\" said Marco Piccardo. \"It opens unprecedented design capabilities in photonics, with many spectral and structural components to address.\"\nThe broadband nature of these new light beams poses new challenges for their characterization, which the team has overcome by developing a powerful reconstruction technique, called hyperspectral holography, providing the complete tomography of the complex space-time structures.\n\"Our technique, which combines holography with Fourier transform spectroscopy, enables full characterization of the spatiotemporal profile of complex beams, enabling radically novel applications in the study of light-matter interactions,\" said Giulio Cerullo, a Professor in Politecnico di Milano and co-author of the study.\nThe team showcased the unprecedented control enabled by their space-time shaper by tailoring many properties of the light springs. A beautiful demonstration shows two of such springs dancing together in space and time.\n\"We have found extremely interesting physics using these beams, which could lead us to a whole new generation of compact accelerators and light sources in plasma. This technique is very exciting because it promises to bring these theoretical concepts to the laboratory and to trigger major advance in laser-plasma physics,\" said Jorge Vieira, a Professor in T\u00e9cnico Lisboa and co-author of the study.\nNow that it is finally possible to synthesize these light springs with complete freedom in the laboratory, the next natural step will be to bring them in laser-plasma experiments.\n\"This is a very challenging goal but the nanophotonic fabrication capabilities of INESC MN in Lisbon and the excellent plasma research groups of T\u00e9cnico represent an ideal ecosystem to pursue this ambitious research,\" said Piccardo. \"Combining these advanced space-time beams with intense nonlinear laser-matter interactions could have important fundamental and technological implications. \"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarco Piccardo et al, Broadband control of topological\u2013spectral correlations in space\u2013time beams, Nature Photonics (2023).

   "text": "Scientists from the Department of Energy's Ames National Laboratory made an intriguing discovery while conducting experiments to characterize magnetism in a material known as a dilute magnetic topological insulator where magnetic defects are introduced. Despite this material's ferromagnetism, the team discovered strong antiferromagnetic interactions between some pairs of magnetic defects that play a key role in several families of magnetic topological insulators.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopological insulators (TIs) as their name indicates, are insulators. However, because of their unique electronic band structure, they conduct electricity on the surface under the right conditions. By introducing magnetism, TIs can transmit electrical currents from one point to another without any heat generation or energy loss. This quality means that they have the potential to reduce future energy footprints for computing and electricity transmission.\nAccording to Rob McQueeney, a scientist from Ames Lab and a member of the research team, \"Finding topological insulators is not so easy. You have to find this unique situation where the electronic bands are knotted up.\" He further explained that applying a magnetic field to a TI turns the surface into a unique two-dimensional insulator, while the very edges of the surface remain metallic.\nAn important goal is to obtain a ferromagnetic TI. Ferromagnetism is when all of the magnetic moments in the material spontaneously align in the same direction. However, the team also discovered that TIs are susceptible to antiferromagnetic interactions when defects are introduced. Antiferromagnetism is when some of the ions spontaneously align with neighboring ions. The opposing magnetic forces decrease the overall magnetism of the material.\nThere are two ways that scientists introduce magnetism into a TI. The first is to introduce dilute amounts of magnetic ions, such as manganese-doped bismuth telluride or antimony telluride. The second is to create an intrinsic magnetic TI by inserting a layer of magnetic ions into the material, such as manganese-bismuth-tellurium (MnBi2Te4) and manganese-antimony-tellurium (MnSb2Te4).\nSince the intrinsic magnetic TIs have a full layer of magnetic ions, ideally the magnetism is not randomly distributed the way it is in the first method.\nFor this project, the team focused on dilute magnetic TIs, which have randomly distributed magnetic defects. \"We wanted to understand the magnetic interactions at the most fundamental level. We were doping our sample using small amounts of magnetic ions to try to understand how the magnetic interactions occur,\" said Farhan Islam, an Iowa State University graduate student and team member. \"So basically, we're trying to understand how microscopic interactions affect the overall magnetism of the system.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nTo conduct their research, the team used a specialized method called neutron scattering. This method involves passing a beam of neutrons (sub-atomic particles with a neutral charge) through a sample of material. Data is collected by noting where and when the neutrons that scattered from the sample hit a detector.\nThis type of research can only be done a few places in the world. Neutron scattering for this project was conducted at the Spallation Neutron Source, a Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility operated by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\nOne challenge with neutron scattering is its weak signal. The team had concerns about studying dilute magnetism, because of the small overall number of magnetic ions. \"I was very skeptical that we would see anything at all,\" said McQueeney. \"But we did. Actually, what we saw was pretty straightforward to observe, which was surprising.\"\nThe team discovered that despite the overall ferromagnetism of manganese doped antimony telluride (Sb1.94Mn0.06Te3), some isolated pairs of magnetic defects are coupled antiferromagnetically with opposite moment directions. Other magnetic pairs, especially those in different blocks of the layered structure, are ferromagnetically coupled with parallel moments. The competing magnetic forces decrease the overall magnetism of the material.\n\"The intrinsic magnetic TIs actually have defects in it,\" Islam explained. \"So for example, manganese can actually go into the sites of antimony where they're not supposed to be and the way the manganese is going into those sites is random.\"\nThis random manganese site-mixing creates magnetic defects in the intrinsic magnetic TIs. The team found that the same interactions between defects in the dilute materials also occur in the intrinsic materials (i.e. MnSb2Te4). The magnetic ground state of the intrinsic magnetic TIs can be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic, and the team now understands how magnetic defects control this behavior.\n\"We determined the interactions between defects in the dilute case and realized that these interactions are transferable to the intrinsic case,\" said McQueeney. \"By doing so, we conclude that defects control the magnetic order for both families.\"\nThe study is published in the journal Advanced Materials.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFarhan Islam et al, Role of Magnetic Defects in Tuning Ground States of Magnetic Topological Insulators, Advanced Materials (2023).

   "text": "Quantum information (QI) processing may be the next game changer in the evolution of technology, by providing unprecedented computational capabilities, security and detection sensitivities. Qubits, the basic hardware element for quantum information, are the building block for quantum computers and quantum information processing, but there is still much debate on which types of qubits are actually the best.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch and development in this field is growing at astonishing paces to see which system or platform outruns the other. To mention a few, platforms as diverse as superconducting Josephson junctions, trapped ions, topological qubits, ultra-cold neutral atoms, or even diamond vacancies constitute the zoo of possibilities to make qubits.\nSo far, only a handful of qubit platforms have been demonstrated to have the potential for quantum computing, marking the checklist of high-fidelity controlled gates, easy qubit-qubit coupling, and good isolation from the environment, which means sufficiently long-lived coherence.\nNano-mechanical resonators may be a part of the handful of platforms. They are oscillators, like springs and strings (e.g. guitars) that when driven, create harmonic or anharmonic sounds depending on the strength of the drive. But what happens when we cool a nano resonator down to absolute zero temperature?\nThe energy levels of the oscillator becomes quantized and the resonator vibrates with its characteristic zero point motion. The zero-point motion arises from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In other words, a resonator maintains motion even when it is in the ground state. The realization of a mechanical qubit is possible if the quantized energy levels of a resonator are not evenly spaced.\nThe challenge is to keep the nonlinear effects big enough in the quantum regime, where the oscillator's zero point displacement is miniscule. If this is achieved, then the system may be used as qubit by manipulating it between the two lowest quantum levels without driving it in higher energy states.\nFor many years, there has been a lot of interest in realizing a qubit system with a mechanical nano resonator. In 2021, Fabio Pistolesi (Univ. Bordeaux-CNRS), Andrew N. Cleland (Univ. Chicago), and ICFO Prof. Adrian Bachtold, established a solid theoretical concept of a mechanical qubit, based on a nanotube resonator coupled to a double-quantum dot under an ultrastrong coupling regime.\nThese theoretical results proved that these nanomechanical resonators could indeed become ideal candidates for qubits. Why? Because they have been shown to feature long coherence times, a definite \"must\" for quantum computing.\nTaking into account that there was a theoretical framework to work with, the challenge now was to actually make a qubit out of a mechanical resonator, and find the appropriate conditions and parameters to control the non-linearities in the system.\nAfter several years of endless work on these systems, the challenges of experimentally realizing this has given its first very welcomed green light. In a recent study published in Nature Physics, ICFO researchers Chandan Samanta, Sergio Lucio de Bonis, Christoffer Moller, Roger Tormo-Queralt, W. Yang, Carles Urgell, led by ICFO Prof. Adrian Bachtold, in collaboration with researchers B. Stamenic and B.Thibeault from University of California Santa Barbara, Y. Jin from Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay-CNRS, D.A. Czaplewski from Argonne National Laboratory, and F. Pistolesi from Univ. Bordeaux-CNRS, achieved the first pre-experimental steps for the future realization of a mechanical qubit by demonstrating a new mechanism to boost the  anharmonicity of a mechanical oscillator in its quantum regime.\n\n\n\n\n\n                A platform for an array of 36 mechanical resonator devices. Credit: ICFO\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe experiment: Engineering anharmonicity close to the ground state\nThe team of researchers fabricated a suspended nanotube device of approximately 1.4 micrometers in length, with its extremes hooked onto the edges of two electrodes.  They defined a quantum dot which is a two level electronic system on the vibrating nanotube by electrostatically creating tunnel junctions at both ends of the suspended nanotube.\nThen, by adjusting the voltage on the gate electrode, they allowed the flow of only one electron at a time onto the nanotube. The mechanical motion of the nanotube was then coupled to the single electron in the single electron tunneling regime. This electromechanical coupling created anharmonicity to the mechanical system.\nSubsequently, they decreased the temperature down to mK (milikelvins, almost absolute zero) and entered into an ultra-strong coupling regime where each additional electron on the nanotube shifted the equilibrium position of the nanotube away from its zero-point amplitude. With an amplitude only a factor of 13 over the zero-point motion, they were able to notice these nonlinear vibrations.\nThe results are astonishing because vibrations present in other resonators, cooled to the quantum ground state, showed to only be nonlinear at amplitudes approximately 106 times greater than its zero-point motion.\nThis new mechanism displays remarkable physics because, contrary to what was expected, the anharmonicity increases as the vibrations are cooled closer to the ground state. This is just the opposite of what has been observed in all other mechanical resonators so far. As first author Chandan Samanta says, \"when researchers first began studying nanomechanical resonators, a recurrent question was whether it would be possible to achieve nonlinearities in vibrations that are in the quantum ground state.\"\n\"Some leading researchers in the field argued that this would be a challenging feat due to technological limitations, and this view has remained the accepted paradigm until now. In this context, our work represents a significant conceptual advance because we demonstrate that nonlinear vibrations in the quantum regime are indeed achievable.\"\n\"We are confident that the nonlinear effects could have been further enhanced by getting closer to the quantum ground state, but we were limited by the temperature of our current cryostat. Our work provides a roadmap for achieving nonlinear vibrations in the quantum regime.\"\nContrary to what has been observed so far in other mechanical resonators, the team of researchers found a method to boost the anharmonicity of a mechanical oscillator near its quantum regime. The results of this study set the first stepping stones for the future development of mechanical qubits or even quantum simulators.\nAs Adrian Bachtold remarks, \"It is remarkable that we entered into ultra-strong coupling regime and observed strong anharmonicity in the resonator. But the damping rate becomes large at low temperature due to the coupling of the resonator to one quantum dot.\"\n\"In future experiments that target cat states and mechanical qubits, it will be advantageous to couple nanotube vibrations to a double-quantum dot, since it enables strong nonlinearities together with long-lived mechanical states. The damping arising from the electron in the double-quantum dot is exponentially suppressed at low temperature, so that it should be possible to achieve damping rate of 10 Hz measured in nanotubes at low temperature.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tC.

   "text": "The patterns of light hold tremendous promise for a large encoding alphabet in optical communications, but progress is hindered by their susceptibility to distortion, such as in atmospheric turbulence or in bent optical fiber.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) have outlined a new optical communication protocol that exploits spatial patterns of light for multi-dimensional encoding in a manner that does not require the patterns to be recognized, thus overcoming the prior limitation of modal distortion in noisy channels. The result is a new encoding state-of-the-art of over 50 vectorial patterns of light sent virtually noise-free across a turbulent atmosphere, opening a new approach to high-bit-rate optical communication.\nPublished in Laser & Photonics Reviews, the Wits team from the Structured Light Laboratory in the Wits School of Physics used a new invariant property of vectorial light to encode information. This quantity, which the team call \"vectorness,\" scales from 0 to 1 and remains unchanged when passing through a noisy channel.\nUnlike traditional amplitude modulation which is 0 or 1 (only a two-letter alphabet), the team used the invariance to partition the 0 to 1 vectorness range into more than 50 parts (0, 0.02, 0.04 and so on up to 1) for a 50-letter alphabet. Because the channel over which the information is sent does not distort the vectorness, both sender and received will always agree on the value, hence noise-free information transfer.\nThe critical hurdle that the team overcame is to use patterns of light in a manner that does not require them to be \"recognized,\" so that the natural distortion of noisy channels can be ignored. Instead, the invariant quantity just \"adds up\" light in specialized measurements, revealing a quantity that doesn't see the distortion at all.\n\"This is a very exciting advance because we can finally exploit the many patterns of light as an encoding alphabet without worrying about how noisy the channel is,\" says Professor Andrew Forbes, from the Wits School of Physics. \"In fact, the only limit to how big the alphabet can be is how good the detectors are and not at all influenced by the noise of the channel.\"\nLead author and Ph.D. candidate Keshaan Singh adds, \"To create and detect the vectorness modulation requires nothing more than conventional communications technology, allowing our modal (pattern) based protocol to be deployed immediately in real-world settings.\"\nThe team have already started demonstrations in optical fiber and in fast links across free-space, and believe that the approach can work in other noisy channels, including underwater.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKeshaan Singh et al, A Robust Basis for Multi\u2010Bit Optical Communication with Vectorial Light, Laser & Photonics Reviews (2023).

Imagine trying to eat a sandwich with two hands that were not enantiomers\u2014non-superimposable mirror images\u2014of each other. Consider the pharmacological disasters caused by administering the wrong drug enantiomer or, at a subatomic scale, the importance of the concept of parity in particle physics. Now, thanks to a new study led by researchers at Paul Scherrer Institute PSI, we know that phonons can also possess this property.\nA phonon is a quasiparticle that describes the collective vibrational excitations of the atoms in a crystal lattice; imagine it as the Irish Riverdance of the atoms. Physicists have predicted that if phonons can demonstrate chirality they could have important implications on the fundamental physical properties of materials. With the rapid rise in recent years of research into topological materials that exhibit curious electronic and magnetic surface properties, interest in chiral phonons has grown. Yet, experimental proof for their existence has remained elusive.\nWhat makes phonons chiral is the steps of their dance. In the new study, the atomic vibrations dance a twist that moves forwards like a corkscrew. This corkscrew motion is one of the reasons there has been such a drive to discover the phenomenon. If phonons can revolve in this way, like the coil of wire that forms a solenoid, perhaps they could create a magnetic field in a material.\nA new slant on the problem\nIt is this possibility that motivated the group of Urs Staub at PSI, who led the study. \"It is because we are at the juncture between ultrafast X-ray science and materials research that we could approach the problem from a different angle,\" he says. The researchers are interested in manipulating chiral modes of materials using chiral light\u2014light that is circularly polarized.\nIt was using such light that the researchers could make their proof. Using quartz, one of the best-known minerals whose atoms\u2014silicon and oxygen\u2014form a chiral structure, they showed how circularly polarized light coupled to chiral phonons. To do this, they used a technique known as resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Diamond Light Source in the UK. This was complemented with supporting theoretical descriptions of how the process would create and enable the detection of chiral phonons from groups at the ETH Zurich (Carl Romao and Nicola Spaldin) and MPI Dresden (Jeroen van den Brink).\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n'It doesn't usually work like this in science'\nIn their experiment, circularly polarized light shines on quartz. The photons of light possess angular momentum, which they transfer to the atomic lattice, launching the vibrations into their corkscrew motion. The direction that the phonons revolve depends on the intrinsic chirality of the quartz crystal. As the phonons revolve, they release energy in the form of scattered light, which can be detected.\nImagine standing on a roundabout and throwing a Frisbee. If you throw the Frisbee with the same direction of movement as the roundabout, you would expect it to whizz. Throw it the other way and it will spin less, as the angular momentum of the roundabout and the Frisbee will cancel out. In the same way, when the circularly polarized light twists the same way as the phonon it excites, the signal is enhanced, and chiral phonons could be detected.\nA well-planned experiment, careful theoretical calculations, and then something strange happened: almost everything went according to plan. As soon as they analyzed the results, the difference in response as the chirality of the light flipped was undeniable.\n\"The results were convincing almost immediately, especially when we compared the difference with the other quartz enantiomers,\" remembers PSI scientist and publication first-author Hiroki Ueda. Sitting at his computer to analyze the data, Ueda was the first person to see the results: \"I kept checking my analysis codes to make sure it was true.\" Staub emphasizes, \"It's not normal! It doesn't usually work like this in science!\"\nDuring the quest for chiral phonons, there have been several false alarms. Will this settle the debate? \"Yes, I think so, that's the beauty of this piece of work,\" believes Staub, whose opinion was shared by the reviewers at Nature. \"Because it's simple, and beautiful and straightforward. It's obvious. It's so simple, it's obvious that this is the chiral motion.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHiroki Ueda et al, Chiral phonons in quartz probed by X-rays, Nature (2023).

By showing that the beamsplitter can be used to both induce a special quantum superposition state for one phonon, and further create interference between two phonons, the research team took the first critical steps toward creating a new kind of quantum computer.\nThe results are published in the journal Science and built on years of breakthrough work on phonons by the team at Pritzker Molecular Engineering.\n\"Splitting\" a phonon into a superposition\nIn the experiments, researchers used phonons that have roughly a million times higher pitch than can be heard with the human ear. Previously, Cleland and his team figured out how to create and detect single phonons and were the first to entangle two phonons.\nTo demonstrate these phonons' quantum capabilities, the team\u2014including Cleland's graduate student Hong Qiao\u2014created a beamsplitter that can split a beam of sound in half, transmitting half and reflecting the other half back to its source (beamsplitters already exist for light and have been used to demonstrate the quantum capabilities of photons). The whole system, including two qubits to generate and detect phonons, operates at extremely low temperatures and uses individual surface acoustic wave phonons, which travel on the surface of a material, in this case lithium niobate.\nHowever, quantum physics says a single phonon is indivisible. So when the team sent a single phonon to the beamsplitter, instead of splitting, it went into a quantum superposition, a state where the phonon is both reflected and transmitted at the same time. Observing (measuring) the phonon causes this quantum state to collapse into one of the two outputs.\nThe team found a way to maintain that superposition state by capturing the phonon in two qubits. A qubit is the basic unit of information in quantum computing. Only one qubit actually captures the phonon, but researchers cannot tell which qubit until post-measurement. In other words, the quantum superposition is transferred from the phonon to the two qubits. The researchers measured this two-qubit superposition, yielding \"gold standard proof that the beamsplitter is creating a quantum entangled state,\" Cleland said.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nShowing phonons behave like photons\nIn the second experiment, the team wanted to show an additional fundamental quantum effect that had first been demonstrated with photons in the 1980s. Now known as the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, when two identical photons are sent from opposite directions into a beamsplitter at the same time, the superposed outputs interfere so that both photons are always found traveling together, in one or the other output directions.\nImportantly, the same happened when the team did the experiment with phonons\u2014the superposed output means that only one of the two detector qubits captures phonons, going one way but not the other. Though the qubits only have the ability to capture a single phonon at a time, not two, the qubit placed in the opposite direction never \"hears\" a phonon, giving proof that both phonons are going in the same direction. This phenomenon is called two-phonon interference.\nGetting phonons into these quantum-entangled state is a much bigger leap than doing so with photons. The phonons used here, though indivisible, still require quadrillions of atoms working together in a quantum mechanical fashion. And if quantum mechanics rules physics at only the tiniest realm, it raises questions of where that realm ends and classical physics begins; this experiment further probes that transition.\n\"Those atoms all have to behave coherently together to support what quantum mechanics says they should do,\" Cleland said. \"It's kind of amazing. The bizarre aspects of quantum mechanics are not limited by size.\"\nCreating a new linear mechanical quantum computer\nThe power of quantum computers lies in the \"weirdness\" of the quantum realm. By harnessing the strange quantum powers of superposition and entanglement, researchers hope to solve previously intractable problems. One approach to doing this is to use photons, in what is called a \"linear optical quantum computer.\"\nA linear mechanical quantum computer\u2014which would use phonons instead of photons\u2014itself could have the ability to compute new kinds of calculations. \"The success of the two-phonon interference experiment is the final piece showing that phonons are equivalent to photons,\" Cleland said. \"The outcome confirms we have the technology we need to build a linear mechanical quantum computer.\"\nUnlike photon-based linear optical quantum computing, the University of Chicago platform directly integrates phonons with qubits. That means phonons could further be part of a hybrid quantum computer that combines the best of linear quantum computers with the power of qubit-based quantum computers.\nThe next step is to create a logic gate\u2014an essential part of computing\u2014using phonons, on which Cleland and his team are currently conducting research.\nOther authors on the paper include \u00c9.

This allows quantum computers to explore multiple solutions simultaneously, which could make them significantly faster in certain computational tasks. However, quantum systems are delicate and susceptible to errors caused by interactions with their environment.\n\"Developing strategies to either protect or qubits from this or to detect and correct errors once they have occurred is crucial for enabling the development of large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers,\" says Savona. Together with EPFL physicists Luca Gravina, and Fabrizio Minganti, they have made a significant breakthrough by proposing a \"critical Schr\u00f6dinger cat code\" for advanced resilience to errors. The study introduces a novel encoding scheme that could revolutionize the reliability of quantum computers.\nWhat is a 'critical Schr\u00f6dinger cat code'?\nIn 1935, physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger proposed a thought experiment as a critique of the prevailing understanding of quantum mechanics at the time\u2014the Copenhagen interpretation. In Schr\u00f6dinger's experiment, a cat is placed in a sealed box with a flask of poison and a radioactive source. If a single atom of the radioactive source decays, the radioactivity is detected by a Geiger counter, which then shatters the flask. The poison is released, killing the cat.\nAccording to the Copenhagen view of quantum mechanics, if the atom is initially in superposition, the cat will inherit the same state and find itself in a superposition of alive and dead. \"This state represents exactly the notion of a quantum bit, realized at the macroscopic scale,\" says Savona.\nIn past years, scientists have drawn inspiration by Schr\u00f6dinger's cat to build an encoding technique called \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat code.\" Here, the 0 and 1 states of the qubit are encoded onto two opposite phases of an oscillating electromagnetic field in a resonant cavity, similarly to the dead or alive states of the cat.\n\"Schr\u00f6dinger cat codes have been realized in the past using two distinct approaches,\" explains Savona. \"One leverages anharmonic effects in the cavity, the other relying on carefully engineered cavity losses. In our work, we bridged the two by operating in an intermediate regime, combining the best of both worlds. Although previously believed to be unfruitful, this hybrid regime results in enhanced error suppression capabilities.\" The core idea is to operate close to the critical point of a phase transition, which is what the 'critical' part of the critical cat code refers to.\nThe critical cat code has an additional advantage: it exhibits exceptional resistance to errors that result from random frequency shifts, which often pose significant challenges to operations involving multiple qubits. This solves a major problem and paves the way to the realization of devices with several mutually interacting qubits\u2014the minimal requirement for building a quantum computer.\n\"We are taming the quantum cat,\" says Savona. \"By operating in a hybrid regime, we have developed a system that surpasses its predecessors, which represents a significant leap forward for cat qubits and quantum computing as a whole. The study is a milestone on the road towards building better quantum computers, and showcases EPFL's dedication in advancing the field of quantum science and unlocking the true potential of quantum technologies.\"\nThe findings are published in the journal PRX Quantum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLuca Gravina et al, Critical Schr\u00f6dinger Cat Qubit, PRX Quantum (2023).

However, the University of Minnesota team has discovered a simple process to \"tune\" this value in lanthanum strontium cobaltite, a material often used in fuel cells. Similar to the way a switch controls the flow of electricity to a light bulb, the researchers' method provides a way to turn heat flow on and off in devices.\n\"Controlling how well a material can transfer heat is of great importance in daily life and in industry,\" said Xiaojia Wang, co-corresponding author of the study and an associate professor in the University of Minnesota Department of Mechanical Engineering. \"With this research, we have achieved a record-high tuning of thermal conductivity, showing promise for effective thermal management and energy consumption in the electronic devices people use every day.

This allowed Wang and her research team to manipulate the material by applying a low voltage to it.\n\"Electrolyte gating is a tremendously powerful technique for controlling the properties of materials, and is well established for voltage-control of electronic, magnetic, and optical behavior,\" said Leighton, co-corresponding author of the study and a faculty member in the University of Minnesota Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science. \"This new work applies this approach in the realm of thermal properties, where voltage-control of physical behavior is less explored.

   "text": "Ultra-compact, agile endoscopes with a large field of view (FoV), long depth of field (DoF), and short rigid tip length are essential for developing minimally invasive operations and new experimental surgeries. As these fields develop, the requirement for miniaturization and increased precision become progressively demanding.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn existing endoscopes, the rigid tip length is a fundamental limitation of the device's agility within small tortuous ducts, such as an artery. It is primarily constrained by the size of the optical elements required for imaging. Thus, alternative solutions are urgently needed to reduce the tip length.\nIn a new paper published in eLight, a team of scientists led by Dr. Johannes Fr\u00f6ch and Prof Arka Majumdar from the University of Washington have developed a novel technique for reducing the rigid tip length.\nExisting solutions include lensless and computational imaging with single fibers or coherent fiber bundles. However, these are typically limited to a short working distance and often extremely sensitive to bending and twisting of the optical fiber, affecting or even precluding accurate computational reconstruction.\nFlat meta-optics are an emerging and versatile idea in the photonics community to create miniaturized optical elements. These are sub-wavelength diffractive optical elements composed of nano-scale scatterer arrays. They are designed to shape an incident wavefront's phase, amplitude, and spectral response. Such ultrathin flat optics not only dramatically shrink the size of traditional optics but can also combine multiple functionalities in a single surface.\nFlat meta-optics are compatible with high-volume semiconductor manufacturing technology and can create disposable optics. These properties have already inspired researchers to explore the potential of meta-optics for endoscopy, including fiber-integrated endoscopy, side-viewing single fiber scanning endoscopy, and scanning fiber forward-viewing endoscopy.\n\n\n\n\n\n                An optical microscope image of the fabricated meta-optic(left ) placed in front of the coherent fiber bundle.

Tanguy, Shane Colburn, Alan Zhan, Andrea Ravagli, Eric J. Seibel, Karl B\u00f6hringer, Arka Majumdar\n             \n\n\nUnfortunately, meta-optics traditionally suffer from strong aberrations, making large FoV and full-color imaging challenging. Several works have shown that the standard metalens design is unsuitable for simultaneously capturing color information across the visible spectrum.\nIt typically results in crisp images for the design wavelength (e.g. green) but strongly aberrated/ blurred for other colors (red and blue). While some approaches like dispersion engineering and computational imaging techniques can reduce chromatic aberration, they either suffer from small apertures, low numerical apertures or require a computational post-processing step, complicating real-time video capture.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, an additional aperture before the meta-optic can provide a larger FoV. However, it comes at the cost of reduced light collection and increased thickness of the optics. So far, these limitations have restricted most meta-optics endoscopes to single wavelength operation.\nAlthough, recently, a meta-optic doublet was demonstrated in conjunction with a coherent fiber bundle for polychromatic imaging. Such polychromatic imaging is unsuitable for broad-band illumination, which is often the case for clinical endoscopy. Additionally, the front aperture was limited to 125 \u03bcm, with a short working distance of 200 \u03bcm.\nThe research team noted a desire for broad-band, ultra-thin meta-optics for endoscopy. However, making it smaller than the optical fiber diameter is not conducive and severely limits the light collection. As such, full-color meta-optical endoscopy with acceptable FoV, DoF, and large enough aperture has not yet been achieved.\nIn this work, the research team demonstrated an inverse-designed meta-optic optimized to capture real-time full color scenes with a 1 mm diameter coherent fiber bundle. The meta-optic enables operations at an FoV of 22.5\u00b0, a DoF of > 30 mm (exceeding 300% of the nominal design working distance) and a minimum rigid tip length of only ~ 2.5 mm.\nThis is a 33% tip length reduction compared to a traditional commercial gradient-index (GRIN) lens integrated fiber bundle endoscope.

To achieve exceptional FoV, DoF, and color performance of the Meta-Optical Fiber Endoscope (MOFIE), the research team approached this design problem from a system-level perspective.\nThey believed that the diameter and spacing of individual fiber cores within the bundle limit the achievable image quality, which also limits the achievable FoV and modulation transfer function (MTF). This aspect is implemented in an automatic differentiation framework using the average volume under the multichromatic modulation transfer function (MTF) curve as the figure of merit.\nBy ensuring that the meta-optic has an MTF within the limitations of the fiber bundle, the research team achieved full-color operation without requiring a computational reconstruction step, thus facilitating real-time operation. The team emphasized that its design approach fundamentally differs from traditional achromatic metalens design efforts.\nThe researchers formulated an optimization problem to find the best solution for full-color imaging. This was instead of trying to achieve diffraction-limited performance in all wavelengths, which may pose a physically unsolvable problem.\nThis approach is important because it is not limited to this particular system. It can be extended to larger aperture sizes and support computational post-processing steps. To highlight this, they also demonstrated an example of a meta-optic with a 1 cm aperture and full-color imaging under ambient light conditions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohannes E.

   "text": "Living organisms, ecosystems and the planet Earth are, from a physics point of view, examples of extraordinarily large and complex systems that are not in thermal equilibrium. To physically describe non-equilibrium systems, dynamic density functional theory has been used to date.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, this theory has weaknesses, as physicists from the University of Bayreuth have now shown in an article published in the Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter. Power functional theory proves to perform substantially better\u2014in combination with artificial intelligence methods, it enables more reliable descriptions and predictions of the dynamics of non-equilibrium systems over time.\nMany-particle systems are all kind of systems composed of atoms, electrons, molecules, and other particles invisible to the eye. They are in thermal equilibrium when the temperature is balanced and no heat flow occurs. A system in thermal equilibrium changes its state only when external conditions change. Density functional theory is tailor-made for the study of such systems.\nFor more than half a century, it has proven its unrestricted value in chemistry and materials science. Based on a powerful classical variant of this theory, states of equilibrium systems can be described and predicted with high accuracy. Dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) extends the scope of this theory to non-equilibrium systems. This involves the physical understanding of systems whose states are not fixed by their external boundary conditions.\nThese systems have a momentum of their own: they have the ability to change their states without external influences acting on them. Findings and application methods of DDFT are therefore of great interest, for example, for the study of models for living organisms or microscopic flows.\nThe error potential of dynamic density functional theory\nHowever, DDFT uses an auxiliary construction to make non-equilibrium systems accessible to physical description. It translates the continuous dynamics of these systems into a temporal sequence of equilibrium states. This results in a potential for errors that should not be underestimated, as the Bayreuth team led by Prof. Dr. Matthias Schmidt shows in the new study.\nThe investigations focused on a comparatively simple example\u2014the unidirectional flow of a gas known in physics as a \"Lennard-Jones fluid.\" If this nonequilibrium system is interpreted as a chain of successive equilibrium states, one aspect involved in the time-dependent dynamics of the system is neglected, namely the flow field. As a result, DDFT may provide inaccurate descriptions and predictions.\n\"We do not deny that dynamic density functional theory can provide valuable insights and suggestions when applied to nonequilibrium systems under certain conditions. The problem, however, and we want to draw attention to this in our study using fluid flow as an example, is that it is not possible to determine with sufficient certainty whether these conditions are met in any particular case. The DDFT does not provide any control over whether the restricted framework conditions are given under which it enables reliable calculations. This makes it all the more worthwhile to develop alternative theoretical concepts for understanding nonequilibrium systems,\" says Prof. Dr. Daniel de las Heras, first author of the study.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nPower functional theory proves to perform substantially better\nFor ten years, the research team around Prof. Dr. Matthias Schmidt has been making significant contributions to the development of a still young physical theory, which has so far proven to be very successful in the physical study of many-particle systems: power functional theory (PFT). The physicists from Bayreuth are pursuing the goal of being able to describe the dynamics of non-equilibrium systems with the same precision and elegance with which classical density functional theory enables the analysis of equilibrium systems.\nIn their new study, they now use the example of a fluid flow to show that power functional theory is significantly superior to DDFT when it comes to understanding non-equilibrium systems. PFT allows the dynamics of these systems to be described without having to take a detour via a chain of successive equilibrium states in time. The decisive factor here is the use of artificial intelligence. Machine learning opens up the time-dependent behavior of the fluid flow by including all factors relevant to the system's inherent dynamics\u2014including the flow field. In this way, the team has even succeeded in controlling the flow of the Lennard-Jones fluid with high precision.\n\"Our investigation provides further evidence that power function theory is a very promising concept that can be used to describe and explain the dynamics of many-particle systems. In Bayreuth, we intend to further elaborate this theory in the coming years, applying it to nonequilibrium systems that have a much higher degree of complexity than the fluid flow we studied. In this way, the PFT will be able to supersede the dynamic density functional theory, whose systemic weaknesses it avoids according to our findings so far. The original density functional theory, which is tailored to equilibrium systems and has proven its worth, is retained as an elegant special case of PFT,\" says Prof. Dr. Matthias Schmidt, who is chair of theoretical physics II at the University of Bayreuth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel de las Heras et al, Perspective: How to overcome dynamical density functional theory, Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter (2023).

   "text": "Since axions were first predicted by theory nearly half a century ago, researchers have hunted for proof of the elusive particle, which may exist outside the visible universe, in the dark sector. But how does one find particles that can't be seen?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first physics results from the Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills experiment at Los Alamos \u2014just described in a publication in the journal Physical Review D\u2014suggest that liquid-argon, accelerator-based experimentation, designed initially to look for similarly hypothetical particles such as sterile neutrinos, may also be an ideal set-up for seeking out stealthy axions.\n\"The confirmation of dark sector particles would have a profound impact on the understanding of the Standard Model of particle physics, as well as the origin and evolution of the universe,\" said physicist Richard Van de Water. \"A big focus of the physics community is exploring ways to detect and confirm these particles. The Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills experiment couples existing predictions of dark matter particles such as axions with high-intensity particle accelerators capable of producing this hard-to-find dark matter.\"\nDemystifying the dark sector\nPhysics theory suggests that only 5% of the universe is made up of visible matter\u2014atoms that form things we can see, touch and feel\u2014and that the remaining 95% is the combination of matter and energy known as the dark sector. Axions, sterile neutrinos and others may explain and account for all or part of that missing energy density.\nThe existence of axions could also resolve a longstanding problem in the Standard Model, which outlines the known behavior of the subatomic world. Sometimes referred to as \"fossils\" of the universe, speculated to originate just a second after the Big Bang, axions could also tell us much about the founding moments of the universe.\nThe Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills experiment was one of several projects to receive Department of Energy funding for dark sector research in 2019, along with substantial funding from the Laboratory Directed Research and Development program at Los Alamos. A prototype detector dubbed the CCM120 was built and run during the 2019 Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) beam cycle. The Physical Review D publication describes results from the CCM120's initial engineering run.\n\"Based on the first run of CAPTAIN-Mills research, the experiment has demonstrated the capability to execute the search for axions,\" said Bill Louis, also a physicist on the project at Los Alamos. \"We're realizing that the energy regime provided by the proton beam at LANSCE and the liquid argon detector design offers an unexplored paradigm for axion-like particle research.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nExperiment design\nStationed in the Lujan Center adjacent to LANSCE, the Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills experiment is a 10-ton, supercooled, liquid argon detector. (CAPTAIN stands for Cryogenic Apparatus for Precision Tests of Argon Reactions with Neutrinos.)\nHigh-intensity, 800-megaelectron volt protons generated by the LANSCE accelerator hit a tungsten target in the Lujan Center, then traverse 23 meters through extensive steel and concrete shielding to the detector to interact in the liquid argon.\nThe prototype detector's interior walls are lined with 120, eight-inch, sensitive photomultiplier tubes (hence the CCM120 moniker) that detect light flashes\u2014single photons\u2014that result when a regular or dark sector particle jostles an atom in the tank of liquid argon.\nA special material coating on the interior walls converts the argon light emission into visible light that can be detected by the photo-multiplier tubes. Fast timing of the detector and beam helps remove the effects of background particles such as beam neutrons, cosmic rays and gamma-rays from radioactive decays.\nPieces of the puzzle\nAxions are of great interest because they are \"highly motivated\"; that is, their existence is strongly implied in theories beyond the Standard Model. Developed over more than 70 years, the Standard Model explains three of the four known fundamental forces\u2014electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force\u2014that govern the behavior of atoms, the building blocks of matter. (The fourth force, gravity, is explained by Einsteinian relativity.) But the model isn't necessarily complete.\nAn unresolved problem in Standard Model physics is known as the \"strong CP problem,\" with \"CP\" meaning charge-parity symmetry. Essentially, particles and their antiparticle counterparts are acted upon similarly by the laws of physics. Nothing in Standard Model physics mandates that behavior, though, so physicists should see at least occasional violations of that symmetry.\nIn weak-force interactions, charge-parity symmetry violations do occur. But no similar violations have been observed in strong-force interactions. That puzzling absence of theoretically possible behavior represents a problem for Standard Model theory. What prevents violations of charge-parity symmetry from occurring in strong-force interactions?\nAbundant, nearly weightless and electrically neutral, axions may be an important part of the puzzle. The axion earned its moniker in 1978, so-coined by physicist Frank Wilczek after a brand of laundry detergent because such a particle could \"clean up\" the strong CP problem. Physicists speculate that they are components of a dark matter force that preserves charge-parity symmetry, and that they may couple, or interact with, photons and electrons.\nNext steps\nIf axions do exist, finding them might be a matter of devising the right experimental set-up.\n\"As a result of this initial run with our CCM120 detector, we have a much better understanding of the signatures connected with axion-like particles coupled to photons and to electrons as they move through liquid argon,\" said Louis. \"These data give us the insight to upgrade the detector to be more sensitive by an order of magnitude.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA.

One of the biggest distinctions is in their behavior, Jin said.\n\"Bosons can occupy the same energy level; fermions don't like to stay together,\" he said, \"Together, these behaviors construct the universe as we know it.\"\nFermions, such as electrons, underlie the matter with which we are most familiar as they are stable and interact through the electrostatic force. Meanwhile bosons, such as photons (particles of light), tend to be more difficult to create or manipulate as they are either fleeting or do not interact with each other.\nA clue to their distinct behaviors is in their different quantum mechanical characteristics, Xiong explained. Fermions have half-integer \"spins\" such as 1/2 or 3/2 et cetera, while bosons have whole integer spins (1, 2, etc.). An exciton is a state in which a negatively charged electron (a fermion) is bound to its positively charged opposite \"hole\" (another fermion), with the two half-integer spins together becoming a whole integer, creating a bosonic particle.\nTo create and identify excitons in their system, the researchers layered the two lattices and shone strong lights on them in a method they call \"pump-probe spectroscopy.\" The combination of particles from each of the lattices (electrons from the tungsten disulfide and the holes from the tungsten diselenide) and the light created a favorable environment for the formation of and interactions between the excitons while allowing the researchers to probe these particles' behaviors.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"And when these excitons reached a certain density, they could not move anymore,\" Jin said. Thanks to strong interactions, the collective behaviors of these particles at a certain density forced them into a crystalline state, and created an insulating effect due to their immobility.\n\"What happened here is that we discovered the correlation that drove the bosons into a highly ordered state,\" Xiong added. Generally, a loose collection of bosons under ultracold temperatures will form a condensate, but in this system, with both light and increased density and interaction at relatively higher temperatures, they organized themselves into a symmetric solid and charge-neutral insulator.\nThe creation of this exotic state of matter proves that the researchers' moir\u00e9 platform and pump-probe spectroscopy could become an important means for creating and investigating bosonic materials.\n\"There are many-body phases with fermions that result in things like superconductivity,\" Xiong said. \"There are also many-body counterparts with bosons that are also exotic phases. So what we've done is create a platform, because we did not really have a great way to study bosons in real materials.\" While excitons are well-studied, he added, there hadn't until this project been a way to coax them to interacting strongly with one another.\nWith their method, according to Jin, it could be possible to not only study well-known bosonic particles like excitons but also open more windows into the world of condensed matter with new bosonic materials.\n\"We know that some materials have very bizarre properties,\" he said. \"And one goal of condensed matter physics is to understand why they have these rich properties and find ways to make these behaviors come out more reliably.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRichen Xiong et al, Correlated insulator of excitons in WSe 2 /WS 2 moir\u00e9 superlattices, Science (2023).

   "text": "Using some of the world's most powerful supercomputers, a group of theorists has produced a major advance in the field of nuclear physics\u2014a calculation of the \"heavy quark diffusion coefficient.\" This number describes how quickly a melted soup of quarks and gluons\u2014the building blocks of protons and neutrons, which are set free in collisions of nuclei at powerful particle colliders\u2014transfers its momentum to heavy quarks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer, it turns out, is very fast. As described in a paper just published in Physical Review Letters, the momentum transfer from the \"freed up\" quarks and gluons to the heavier quarks occurs at the limit of what quantum mechanics will allow. These quarks and gluons have so many short-range, strong interactions with the heavier quarks that they pull the \"boulder\"-like particles along with their flow.\nThe work was led by Peter Petreczky and Swagato Mukherjee of the nuclear theory group at the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory, and included theorists from the Bielefeld, Regensburg, and Darmstadt Universities in Germany, and the University of Stavanger in Norway.\nThe calculation will help explain experimental results showing heavy quarks getting caught up in the flow of matter generated in heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Europe's CERN laboratory. The new analysis also adds corroborating evidence that this matter, known as a \"quark-gluon plasma\" (QGP), is a nearly perfect liquid, with a viscosity so low that it also approaches the quantum limit.\n\"Initially, seeing heavy quarks flow with the QGP at RHIC and the LHC was very surprising,\" Petreczky said. \"It would be like seeing a heavy rock get dragged along with the water in a stream. Usually, the water flows but the rock stays.\"\nThe new calculation reveals why that surprising picture makes sense when you think about the extremely low viscosity of the QGP.\nFrictionless flow\nThe low viscosity of matter generated in RHIC's collisions of gold ions, first reported on in 2005, was a major motivator for the new calculation, Petreczky said. When those collisions melt the boundaries of individual protons and neutrons to set free the inner quarks and gluons, the fact that the resulting QGP flows with virtually no resistance is evidence that there are many strong interactions among the quarks and gluons in the hot quark soup.\n\"The low viscosity implies that the 'mean free path' between the 'melted' quarks and gluons in the hot, dense QGP is extremely small,\" said Mukherjee, explaining that the mean free path is the distance a particle can travel before interacting with another particle.\n\"If you think about trying to walk through a crowd, it's the typical distance you can get before you bump into someone or have to change your course,\" he said.\nWith a short mean free path, the quarks and gluons interact frequently and strongly. The collisions dissipate and distribute the energy of the fast-moving particles and the strongly interacting QGP exhibits collective behavior\u2014including nearly frictionless flow.\n\"It's much more difficult to change the momentum of a heavy quark because it's like a train\u2014hard to stop,\" Mukherjee noted. \"It would have to undergo many collisions to get dragged along with the plasma.\"\nBut if the QGP is indeed a perfect fluid, the mean free path for the heavy quark interactions should be short enough to make that possible. Calculating the heavy quark diffusion coefficient\u2014which is proportional to how strongly the heavy quarks are interacting with the plasma\u2014was a way to check this understanding.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nCrunching the numbers\nThe calculations needed to solve the equations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD)\u2014the theory that describes quark and gluon interactions\u2014are mathematically complex. Several advances in theory and powerful supercomputers helped to pave the way for the new calculation.\n\"In 2010/11 we started using a mathematical shortcut, which assumed the plasma consisted only of gluons, no quarks,\" said Olaf Kaczmarek of Bielefeld University, who led the German part of this effort. Thinking only of gluons helped the team to work out their method using lattice QCD. In this method, scientists run simulations of particle interactions on a discretized four-dimensional space-time lattice.\nEssentially, they \"place\" the particles on discrete positions on an imaginary 3D grid to model their interactions with neighboring particles and see how those interactions change over time (the 4th dimension). They use many different starting arrangements and include varying distances between particles.\nAfter working out the method with only gluons, they figured out how to add in the complexity of the quarks.\nThe scientists loaded a large number of sample configurations of quarks and gluons onto the 4D lattice and used Monte Carlo methods\u2014repeated random sampling\u2014to try to find the most probable distribution of quarks and gluons within the lattice.\n\"By averaging over those configurations, you get a correlation function related to the heavy quark diffusion coefficient,\" said Luis Altenkort, a University of Bielefeld graduate student who also worked on this research at Brookhaven Lab.\nAs an analogy, think about estimating the air pressure in a room by sampling the positions and motion of the molecules. \"You try to use the most probable distributions of molecules based on another variable, such as temperature, and exclude improbable configurations\u2014such as all the air molecules being clustered in one corner of the room,\" Altenkort said.\nIn the case of the QGP, the scientists were trying to simulate a thermalized system\u2014where even on the tiny-fraction-of-a-second timescale of heavy ion particle collisions, the quarks and gluons come to some equilibrium temperature.\nThey simulated the QGP at a range of fixed temperatures and calculated the heavy quark diffusion coefficient for each temperature to map out the temperature dependence of the heavy quark interaction strength (and the mean free path of those interactions).\n\"These demanding calculations were possible only by using some of the world's most powerful supercomputers,\" Kaczmarek said.\nThe computing resources included Perlmutter at the National Energy Research for Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), a DOE Office of Science User Facility located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Juwels Booster at the Juelich Research Center in Germany; Marconi at CINECA in Italy; and dedicated lattice QCD GPU clusters at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) and at Bielefeld University.\nAs Mukherjee noted, \"These powerful machines don't just do the job for us while we sit back and relax; it took years of hard work to develop the codes that can squeeze the most efficient performance out of these supercomputers to do our complex calculations.\"\nRapid thermalization, short-range interactions\nThe calculations show that the heavy quark diffusion coefficient is largest right at the temperature at which the QGP forms, and then decreases with increasing temperatures. This result implies that the QGP comes to an equilibrium extremely rapidly.\n\"You start with two nuclei, with essentially no temperature, then you collide them and in less than one quadrillionth of a second, you get a thermal system,\" Petreczky said. Even the heavy quarks get thermalized.\nFor that to happen, the heavy quarks have to undergo many scatterings with other particles very quickly\u2014implying that the mean free path of these interactions must be very small. Indeed, the calculations show that, at the transition to QGP, the mean free path of the heavy quark interactions is very close to the shortest distance allowable. That so-called quantum limit is established by the inherent uncertainty of knowing both a particle's position and momentum simultaneously.\nThis independent \"measure\" provides corroborating evidence for the low viscosity of the QGP, substantiating the picture of its perfect fluidity, the scientists say.\n\"The shorter the mean free path, the lower the viscosity, and the faster the thermalization,\" Petreczky said.\nSimulating real collisions\nNow that scientists know how the heavy quark interactions with the QGP vary with temperature, they can use that information to improve their understanding of how the actual heavy ion collision systems evolve.\n\"My colleagues are trying to develop more accurate simulations of how the interactions of the QGP affect the motion of heavy quarks,\" Petreczky said. \"To do that, they need to take into account the dynamical effects of how the QGP expands and cools down\u2014all the complicated stages of the collisions.\"\n\"Now that we know how the heavy quark diffusion coefficient changes with temperature, they can take this parameter and plug it into their simulations of this complicated process and see what else needs to be changed to make those simulations compatible with the experimental data at RHIC and the LHC.\"\nThis effort is the subject of a major collaboration known as the Heavy-Flavor Theory (HEFTY) for QCD Matter Topical Theory Collaboration.\n\"We'll be able to better model the motion of heavy quarks in the QGP, and then have a better theory to data comparison,\" Petreczky said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLuis Altenkort et al, Heavy Quark Diffusion from 2+1 Flavor Lattice QCD with 320 MeV Pion Mass, Physical Review Letters (2023).

   "text": "A major stumbling block in our understanding of glass and glass phenomena is the elusive relationship between relaxation dynamics and glass structure. A team led by Dr. Qiaoshi Zeng from HPSTAR recently developed a new in situ high-pressure wide-angle X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy method to enable atomic-scale relaxation dynamics studies in metallic glass systems under extreme pressures.

As thermodynamically metastable materials, like typical glasses, MGs spontaneously evolve into their more stable states all the time through various relaxation dynamic behaviors.\nThese relaxation behaviors have significant effects on the physical properties of MGs. Still, until now, scientists' ability to deepen the understanding of glass relaxation dynamics and especially its relationships with atomic structures has been limited by the available techniques.\n\"Thanks to the recent improvements in synchrotron X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS), measuring the collective particle motions of glassy samples with a high resolution and broad coverage in the time scale is possible, and thus, various microscopic dynamic processes otherwise inaccessible have been explored in glasses,\" said Dr. Zeng.\n\"However, the change in atomic structures is subtle in previous relaxation process measurements, which makes it still difficult to probe the relationship between the structure and relaxation behavior. To overcome this problem, we decided to employ high pressure because it can effectively alternate the structure of various materials, including MG.\"\nTo this end, the team developed in situ high-pressure synchrotron wide-angle XPCS to probe a cerium-based MG material during compression. In situ high-pressure wide-angle XPCS revealed that the collective atomic motion initially slows down, as generally expected with increasing density. Then, counter-intuitively it accelerates with further compression, showing an unusual non-monotonic pressure-induced steady relaxation dynamics crossover at ~3 GPa.\nFurthermore, by combining these results with in situ high-pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction, the relaxation dynamics anomaly closely correlates with the dramatic changes in local atomic structures during compression, rather than monotonically scaling with either the sample density or overall stress level.\n\"With density increases, atoms in glasses generally get more difficult to move or diffuse, slowing down its relaxation dynamics. This is what we normally expect from hydrostatic compression,\" Dr. Zeng explained.\n\"So the non-monotonic relaxation behavior observed here in the cerium-based MG under pressure is quite unusual, which indicates besides density, structural details could also play an important role in glass relaxation dynamics,\" Dr. Zeng explained.\nThese findings demonstrate that there is a close relationship between glass relaxation dynamics and atomic structures in MGs. The technique Dr. Qiaoshi Zeng's group developed here can also be extended to explore the relationship between relaxation dynamics and atomic structures in various glasses, especially those significantly tunable by compression, offering new opportunities for glass relaxation dynamics studies at extreme conditions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQiaoshi Zeng et al, Pressure-induced nonmonotonic cross-over of steady relaxation dynamics in a metallic glass, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

Spin-polarized electric currents play a central role in spintronics, due to the capabilities of manipulation and detection of magnetic moment directions for writing and reading 1s and 0s. Currently, most spintronic devices are based on ferromagnets, where the net magnetizations can efficiently spin polarize electric currents.\nAntiferromagnets, with opposite magnetic moments aligned alternately, are less investigated but may promise even faster and smaller spintronic devices. However, antiferromagnets have zero net magnetization and thus are commonly believed to carry solely spin-neutral currents useless for spintronics. While antiferromagnets consist of two antiparallel aligned magnetic sublattices, their properties are deemed to be \"averaged out\" over the sublattices making them spin independent.\nProf. Shao Ding-Fu, who led the team, has a different point of view in this research. He envisioned that collinear antiferromagnets can function as \"electrical circuits\" with the two magnetic sublattices connected in parallel. With this simple intuitive picture in mind, Prof. Shao and his collaborators theoretically predicted that magnetic sublattices could polarize the electric current locally, thus resulting in the staggered spin currents hidden within the globally spin-neutral current.\nHe dubbed these staggered spin currents as \"N\u00e9el spin currents\" after Louis N\u00e9el, a Nobel laureate, who won the prize due to the fundamental work and discoveries concerning antiferromagnetism.\nThe N\u00e9el spin currents is a unique nature of antiferromagnets which has never been recognized. It is capable to generate useful spin-dependent properties which have been previously considered incompatible with antiferromagnets, such as a spin-transfer torque and tunneling magnetoresistance in antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions, crucial for electrical writing and reading of information in antiferromagnetic spintronics.\n\"Our work uncovered a previously unexplored potential of antiferromagnets, and offered a straightforward solution to achieve the efficient reading and writing for antiferromagnetic spintronics,\" said Prof. Shao Ding-Fu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDing-Fu Shao et al, N\u00e9el Spin Currents in Antiferromagnets, Physical Review Letters (2023).

   "text": "At the time of the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, every particle of matter is thought to have been produced together with an antimatter equivalent of opposite electrical charge. But in the present-day universe, there is much more matter than antimatter. Why this is the case is one of physics' greatest questions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer may lie, at least partly, in particles called neutrinos, which lack electrical charge, are almost massless and change their identity\u2014or \"oscillate\"\u2014from one of three types to another as they travel through space. If neutrinos oscillated in a different way to their antimatter equivalents, antineutrinos, they could help explain the matter\u2013antimatter imbalance in the universe.\nExperiments across the world, such as the NOvA experiment in the US, are investigating this possibility, as will next-generation experiments including DUNE. In these long-baseline neutrino-oscillation experiments, a beam of neutrinos is measured after it has traveled a long distance\u2014the long baseline. The experiment is then run with a beam of antineutrinos, and the outcome is compared with that of the neutrino beam to see if the two twin particles oscillate in a similar or different way.\nThis comparison depends on an estimation of the numbers of neutrinos in the neutrino and antineutrino beams before they travel. These beams are produced by firing beams of protons onto fixed targets. The interactions with the target create other hadrons, which are focused using magnetic \"horns\" and directed into long tunnels in which they transform into neutrinos and other particles. But in this multi-step process, it isn't easy to work out the particle content of the resulting beams\u2014including the number of neutrinos they contain\u2014which depends directly on the proton\u2013target interactions.\nEnter the NA61 experiment at CERN, also known as SHINE. Using high-energy proton beams from the Super Proton Synchrotron and appropriate targets, the experiment can recreate the relevant proton\u2013target interactions. NA61/SHINE has previously made measurements of electrically charged hadrons that are produced in the interactions and yield neutrinos. These measurements helped improve estimations of the content of neutrino beams used at existing long-baseline experiments.\nThe NA61/SHINE collaboration has now released new hadron measurements that will help improve these estimations further. This time around, using a proton beam with an energy of 120 GeV and a carbon target, the collaboration measured three kinds of electrically neutral hadrons that decay into neutrino-yielding charged hadrons.\nThis 120-GeV proton\u2013carbon interaction is used to produce NOvA's neutrino beam, and it will probably also be used to create DUNE's beam. Estimations of the numbers of the different neutrino-yielding neutral hadrons that the interaction produces rely on computer simulations, the output of which varies significantly depending on the underlying physics details.\n\"Up to now, simulations for neutrino experiments that use this interaction have relied on uncertain extrapolations from older measurements with different energies and target nuclei. This new direct measurement of particle production from 120-GeV protons on carbon reduces the need for these extrapolations,\" explains NA61/SHINE deputy spokesperson Eric Zimmerman.\nThe paper is published in the journal Physical Review D.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tH.

   "text": "Nanophotonics and topology have generated significant interest due to the unique properties they offer. One area of focus is the investigation of topological edge states (TESs). These states have captured widespread attention because they are very resistant to errors and imperfections.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nArising from topologically non-trivial phases, TESs provide a powerful toolkit for the architectural design of photonic integrated circuits. TES transport has led to the discovery of various intriguing optical effects and applications, including directional couplers, one-way waveguides, mode-locked waveguides, and pseudospin propagation in ring resonator arrays.\nScientists have recently expanded their efforts to manipulate TESs by exploring techniques such as adiabatic modulation, non-linear effects, and complex braiding. Optical systems have demonstrated a range of intriguing phenomena, such as edge-to-edge topological transport and tunable localization of topological states. These phenomena hold immense potential for the development of state-of-the-art technologies and applications, including energy and information routing, non-linear photonics, and quantum computing.\nWhile current methods focus on manipulating TESs, they have not yet paid much attention to enhancing the interaction between TESs. By improving the coupling between TESs, researchers can enable the exchange of light energy between different parts of a topological lattice, which can help control the transport of TESs in a more flexible way.\nA group of researchers from the Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics (WNLO) and the School of Optical and Electronic Information (OEI) at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in China recently made a significant breakthrough. As reported in Advanced Photonics, they developed an innovative approach to efficiently manipulate TES transport for an optical channel switcher on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) chip.\nTheir study focused on edge-to-edge channel conversion in a four-level waveguide lattice using the Landau-Zener (LZ) model. By exploiting the finite-size effect in a two-unit-cell optical lattice, they established an alternative, effective, and dynamic method to modulate and control the transport of topological modes.\nThe waveguide lattice they used is similar to a 2D material called a Chern insulator, which is known to have TESs. As the number of unit cells decreases, the TESs evolve according to the LZ model. By applying the LZ single-band evolution principle, the researchers were able to dynamically control the TESs and achieve almost perfect channel conversion.\nTopological LZ nanophotonic devices have the potential to be used in various other applications. They can be used as switches that work at specific wavelengths of light. By incorporating LZ dynamics into different systems, it may be possible to create chiral channel conversions. This concept can also be expanded to more complex waveguide lattices, allowing for even more advanced devices.\nThe researchers found that these topological LZ optical devices are quite robust, meaning they can work well even when certain parameters are changed. This opens opportunities to develop practical devices such as optical switches for routing networks on computer chips or devices that can combine or separate multiple signals in a waveguide.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBing-Cong Xu et al, Topological Landau\u2013Zener nanophotonic circuits, Advanced Photonics (2023).

   "text": "Superconductors are increasingly finding applications in several areas, such as medical imaging techniques, drug delivery systems, energy storage systems, levitation processes, and water purification methods. This can be attributed to their awe-inspiring ability of zero resistance, which ensures the passage of a high amount of current through them, making them suitable for revolutionizing power transmission and transportation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagnetic superconductors are commonly synthesized by the \"top-seeded melt growth technique\" (TSMG). This process, however, has certain drawbacks, such as huge loss of liquid source material while production. This results in changes to the material composition, cracks in the matrix of the formed material, mechanical shortcomings, and even low thermal conductivity.\nAs an alternative, the infiltration growth process, that involves stacking secondary phase pellets on a liquid phase pellet, has been developed for better efficiency in production and applications. Several compositions of a liquid phase have been used for fabricating such bulk superconductors. However, large, single-grain, bulk rare earth (RE) materials, such as RE-123, are still difficult to synthesize using the infiltration growth process.\nNow, however, researchers from Japan focus on the use of heavy elements such as gadolinium (Gd), yttrium (Y) and erbium (Er), to synthesize single-grain bulk and ternary superconductors, with liquid stock composition and infiltration growth technique. They also closely analyze the microstructure and properties (superconducting and electromagnetic) of the formed superconducting material (Gd, Y, Er)-123.\nTheir findings reveal huge performance improvement of these ternary bulks, compared to the currently available materials in the market. The study was led by Professor Miryala Muralidhar of the Shibaura Institute of Technology and was made available online in the Journal of Alloys and Compounds.\nFirst, the researchers evaluated the performance of multiple liquid source starting materials to grow a (Gd, Y, Er)-123 single grain bulk. After ascertaining that Er123 and Ba3Cu5O8 in a 1:1 ratio was the best liquid phase stock material, they proceeded with adding other primary element components, using their respective oxide powders as the starting material.\nOn evaluating the current flow at critical temperatures, the resulting superconductor was found to allow the flow of highest current density through it, which was 81.09% higher than the previously available materials in this category. Microstructural analysis with scanning electron microscopy revealed a significant reduction in the secondary phase particle size, with a mean particle reduction of 43.13%, compared to the conventional Ba3Cu5O8.\nDiscussing these results, Prof. Miryala says, \"The results are nothing short of impressive. The fact that we were able to fabricate these bulk superconductors in the air, using a cost-effective method, makes this approach highly attractive for large-scale industrial production.\"\nMoreover, Er123+ Ba3Cu5O8 also yielded the highest critical current density (Jc) of 81.91 kA/cm2 in self-field and 28.29 kA/cm2 at 1 T for (Gd, Y, Er)-123 ternary system liquid source.\nThe greatly enhanced current density in the newly synthesized material is the most remarkable aspect of this research and has huge potential for applications of magnetic superconductors. \"These improvements have the potential to revolutionize real-life applications like magnetic levitation, superconducting bearings, electric motors, magnetic drug delivery (MDD) and flywheel energy systems,\" says Prof. Miryala.\nWith such exceptional properties, superconducting materials such as these can greatly enhance and influence power transmission and transportation systems in the near future.  They can also transform multiple industries and become instrumental in combatting climate change, while supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations.\nIn summary, this new approach to synthesizing bulk superconductors has clearly opened the door to mass production of high-performing superconductors and is being deemed as an exciting breakthrough for a wide range of applications.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAkash Garg Agarwal et al, Exploring the effects of liquid source on superconducting properties and microstructure in ternary bulk (Gd, Y, Er)\u2212123 by infiltration growth process, Journal of Alloys and Compounds (2023).

   "text": "Certain isotopes such as Indium-115 (In-115) are extremely long lived, taking over 100 trillion years for half of the Indium atoms to decay away. These isotopes allow scientists to probe the precise internal processes that govern other extremely long-lived isotopes. New research helps scientists improve the frameworks they use to calculate half-lives and other nuclear properties, such as the structure of the protons/neutrons inside the nucleus.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing background simulation/subtraction techniques pioneered in other ton-scale nuclear decay experiments, scientists have extracted the energy spectrum of outgoing electrons from decays of In-115 that occurred inside a LiInSe2 crystal. At the same time, scientists also performed the world's most precise measurement of the decay rate of In-115. This work expands scientific understanding of nuclear structure and paves the way for future experiments to probe nuclear structure for a variety of isotope sizes.\nThe physics processes that determine the decay rate of mid-sized nuclei are difficult for scientists to probe. This is due to the large number of intermediate nuclear energy states. This study shows the viability of extracting clean electron (beta) energy spectra from various long-lived nuclei using low temperature crystal detectors.\nThe research enables scientists to reduce the uncertainties involving intermediate energy states that play a role in long-lived nuclei. This would then allow for improved modeling of complex nuclear systems, such as the double beta decay of Tellurium-130. The reduction of these uncertainties plays a key role in improving the performance of other ton-scale nuclear decay experiments sponsored by the Department of Energy.\nA collaboration including the University of California-Berkeley, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Jyvasklya in Finland, Universite Paris-Saclay, and RMD Inc. commissioned a new LiInSe2 detector to explore the possibility of high-quality, low-background bolometric detectors for use in nuclear decay model verification.\nThe researchers collected data at near absolute zero temperatures to detect and record the very smallest spikes in temperature due to particle interactions, such as those from In-115 beta decays, via highly sensitive thermometers. The study rejected background events such as external gamma rays using a combination of particle simulations and careful examination of individual recorded decays.\nThe result was a clean In-115 decay spectrum of the emitted electrons. Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley compared this spectrum to a library of predicted spectra generated at the University of Jyvaskyla and found the predicted spectrum that most closely matched the collected data. This extracted the most precise measurement to date of the In-115 decay rate.

The hypothesis that nonexponential relaxation peaks contain a series of exponential events is well known, but has not been verified. This is due to the lack of critical experimental evidence, in particular a systematic exponential relaxation spectrum in glasses.\nTo address this issue, the researchers have studied the exponential relaxation spectrum in glasses during the recovery process.\nThe enthalpy relaxation peaks after annealing treatment were measured using a high-precision nanocalorimetry technique that is universal for metallic glasses and organic glasses. To compare the enthalpy relaxation spectrum, the dynamic mechanical spectra were measured under sinusoidal tensile stress using a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA).\nThe relaxation peaks exhibited exponential characteristics that can be fitted by the Debye function. The exponential relaxation events are the units of relaxation in glasses. It is referred to as Relaxun, as the abbreviation of relaxation unit. Additionally, the activation energy of the relaxation spectrum under different annealing temperature and annealing time was determined.\nA complete spectrum of the exponential relaxation peaks was obtained over a wide temperature range from 0.63 Tg to 1.03 Tg, which was similar to the DMA loss modulus curve, thus reflecting that the non-exponential relaxation peaks can be divided into exponential relaxation units. In other words, the spectrum can be precisely controlled by multi-step annealing treatment.\nThe activation energy covers a wide range from \u03b1 relaxation to \u03b2 relaxation and even the fast \u03b3/\u03b2\u2032 relaxation. Furthermore, the quantitative contributions of different relaxation modes to the non-equilibrium enthalpy evolution during aging were measured.\nThis work sheds light on the research of non-equilibrium thermodynamics as well as the precise modulation of glass properties by relaxation mode control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLijian Song et al, Detecting the exponential relaxation spectrum in glasses by high-precision nanocalorimetry, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

   "text": "A University of Minnesota Twin Cities-led team has developed a new superconducting diode, a key component in electronic devices, that could help scale up quantum computers for industry use and improve the performance of artificial intelligence systems. Compared to other superconducting diodes, the researchers' device is more energy efficient; can process multiple electrical signals at a time; and contains a series of gates to control the flow of energy, a feature that has never before been integrated into a superconducting diode.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe paper is published in Nature Communications.\nA diode allows current to flow one way but not the other in an electrical circuit. It's essentially half of a transistor, the main element in computer chips. Diodes are typically made with semiconductors, but researchers are interested in making them with superconductors, which have the ability to transfer energy without losing any power along the way.\n\"We want to make computers more powerful, but there are some hard limits we are going to hit soon with our current materials and fabrication methods,\" said Vlad Pribiag, senior author of the paper and an associate professor in the University of Minnesota School of Physics and Astronomy. \"We need new ways to develop computers, and one of the biggest challenges for increasing computing power right now is that they dissipate so much energy. So, we're thinking of ways that superconducting technologies might help with that.\"\nThe University of Minnesota researchers created the device using three Josephson junctions, which are made by sandwiching pieces of non-superconducting material between superconductors. In this case, the researchers connected the superconductors with layers of semiconductors. The device's unique design allows the researchers to use voltage to control the behavior of the device.\nTheir device also has the ability to process multiple signal inputs, whereas typical diodes can only handle one input and one output. This feature could have applications in neuromorphic computing, a method of engineering electrical circuits to mimic the way neurons function in the brain to enhance the performance of artificial intelligence systems.\n\"The device we've made has close to the highest energy efficiency that has ever been shown, and for the first time, we've shown that you can add gates and apply electric fields to tune this effect,\" explained Mohit Gupta, first author of the paper and a Ph.D. student in the University of Minnesota School of Physics and Astronomy. \"Other researchers have made superconducting devices before, but the materials they've used have been very difficult to fabricate. Our design uses materials that are more industry-friendly and deliver new functionalities.\"\nThe method the researchers used can, in principle, be used with any type of superconductor, making it more versatile and easier to use than other techniques in the field. Because of these qualities, their device is more compatible for industry applications and could help scale up the development of quantum computers for wider use.\n\"Right now, all the quantum computing machines out there are very basic relative to the needs of real-world applications,\" Pribiag said. \"Scaling up is necessary in order to have a computer that's powerful enough to tackle useful, complex problems. A lot of people are researching algorithms and usage cases for computers or AI machines that could potentially outperform classical computers.

   "text": "Understanding the behavior of nuclear matter\u2014including the quarks and gluons that make up the protons and neutrons of atomic nuclei\u2014is extremely complicated. This is particularly true in our world, which is three dimensional. Mathematical techniques from condensed matter physics that consider interactions in just one spatial dimension (plus time) greatly simplify the challenge.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing this two-dimensional approach, scientists solved the complex equations that describe how low-energy excitations ripple through a system of dense nuclear matter. This work indicates that the center of neutron stars, where such dense nuclear matter exists in nature, may be described by an unexpected form.\nBeing able to understand the quark interactions in two dimensions opens a new window into understanding neutron stars, the densest form of matter in the universe. The approach could help advance the current \"golden age\" for studying these exotic stars. This surge in research success was triggered by recent discoveries of gravitational waves and electromagnetic emissions in the cosmos.\nThis work shows that for low-energy excitations, all of the complications of the three-dimensional quark interactions fall away. These low-energy excitations are slight disturbances triggered as a neutron star emits radiation or by its own spinning magnetic fields. This approach might also enable new comparisons with quark interactions in less dense but much hotter nuclear matter generated in heavy-ion collisions.\nThe modern theory of nuclei, known as quantum chromodynamics, involves quarks bound by the strong nuclear force. This force, carried by gluons, confines quarks into nucleons (protons and neutrons).\nWhen the density of nuclear matter increases, as it does inside neutron stars, the dense system behaves more like a mass of quarks, without sharp boundaries between individual nucleons. In this state, quarks at the edge of the system are still confined by the strong force, as quarks on one side of the spherical system interact strongly with quarks on the opposite side.\nThis work by researchers at Brookhaven National Laboratory uses the one-dimensional nature of this strong interaction, plus the dimension of time, to solve for the behavior of excitations with low energy near the edge of the system. These low energy modes are just like those of a free, massless boson\u2014which is known in condensed matter as a \"Luttinger liquid.\"\nThis method allows scientists to compute the parameters of a Luttinger liquid at any given density. It will advance their ability to explore qualitatively new phenomena expected to occur at the extreme densities within neutron stars, where nuclear matter behaves quite differently than it does in ordinary nuclei, and compare it with much hotter (trillion-degree) dense nuclear matter generated in heavy-ion collisions.\nThe work is published in the journal Physical Review D.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarton Lajer et al, When cold, dense quarks in 1+1 and 3+1 dimensions are not a Fermi liquid, Physical Review D (2022).

   "text": "Daniel Lidar, the Viterbi Professor of Engineering at USC and Director of the USC Center for Quantum Information Science & Technology, and Dr. Bibek Pokharel, a Research Scientist at IBM Quantum, have achieved a quantum speedup advantage in the context of a \"bitstring guessing game.\" They managed strings up to 26 bits long, significantly larger than previously possible, by effectively suppressing errors typically seen at this scale. (A bit is a binary number that is either zero or one). Their paper is published in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantum computers promise to solve certain problems with an advantage that increases as the problems increase in complexity. However, they are also highly prone to errors, or noise. The challenge, says Lidar, is \"to obtain an advantage in the real world where today's quantum computers are still 'noisy.'\" This noise-prone condition of current quantum computing is termed the \"NISQ\" (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era, a term adapted from the RISC architecture used to describe classical computing devices. Thus, any present demonstration of quantum speed advantage necessitates noise reduction.\nThe more unknown variables a problem has, the harder it usually is for a computer to solve. Scholars can evaluate a computer's performance by playing a type of game with it to see how quickly an algorithm can guess hidden information. For instance, imagine a version of the TV game Jeopardy, where contestants take turns guessing a secret word of known length, one whole word at a time. The host reveals only one correct letter for each guessed word before changing the secret word randomly.\nIn their study, the researchers replaced words with bitstrings. A classical computer would, on average, require approximately 33 million guesses to correctly identify a 26-bit string. In contrast, a perfectly functioning quantum computer, presenting guesses in quantum superposition, could identify the correct answer in just one guess. This efficiency comes from running a quantum algorithm developed more than 25 years ago by computer scientists Ethan Bernstein and Umesh Vazirani. However, noise can significantly hamper this exponential quantum advantage.\nLidar and Pokharel achieved their quantum speedup by adapting a noise suppression technique called dynamical decoupling. They spent a year experimenting, with Pokharel working as a doctoral candidate under Lidar at USC. Initially, applying dynamical decoupling seemed to degrade performance. However, after numerous refinements, the quantum algorithm functioned as intended. The time to solve problems then grew more slowly than with any classical computer, with the quantum advantage becoming increasingly evident as the problems became more complex.\nLidar notes that \"currently, classical computers can still solve the problem faster in absolute terms.\" In other words, the reported advantage is measured in terms of the time-scaling it takes to find the solution, not the absolute time. This means that for sufficiently long bitstrings, the quantum solution will eventually be quicker.\nThe study conclusively demonstrates that with proper error control, quantum computers can execute complete algorithms with better scaling of the time it takes to find the solution than conventional computers, even in the NISQ era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBibek Pokharel et al, Demonstration of Algorithmic Quantum Speedup, Physical Review Letters (2023).

But for secure communication, encoding large amounts of information in light has additional challenges to ensure the privacy and integrity of the data being transferred.\nAlberto Marino, the Ted S. Webb Presidential Professor in the Homer L. Dodge College of Arts, led the research with OU doctoral student and the study's first author Gaurav Nirala and co-authors Siva T. Pradyumna and Ashok Kumar. Marino also holds positions with OU's Center for Quantum Research and Technology and with the Quantum Science Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\n\"The idea behind the project is to be able to use the spatial properties of the light to encode large amounts of information, just like how an image contains information. However, to be able to do so in a way that is compatible with quantum networks for secure information transfer. When you consider an image, it can be constructed by combining basic spatial patterns know as modes, and depending on how you combine these modes, you can change the image or encoded information,\" Marino said.\n\"What we're doing here that is new and different is that we're not just using those modes to encode information; we're using the correlations between them,\" he added. \"We're using the additional information on how those modes are linked to encode the information.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                Frames (A) and (E) show the target information to be encoded in the spatial cross-correlation of the twin beams. The target is used to calculate the corresponding CGH (B) and (F) with a MRAF algorithm. The dimensions of the SLM pixels (12.5 \u03bcm\u00d712.5 \u03bcm) and its 8-bit resolution together with the f-to-f imaging system are taken into account to calculate the simulated cross-correlations in frames (C) and (G). The measured spatial cross-correlations between the probe and conjugate intensity fluctuations reveal the encoded information, as shown in frames (D) and (H). Except for frames (B) and (F), each pixel value is normalized to the sum of the amplitude squared of all the pixels in the image to provide a better comparison between the simulation and experiment. The maximum values for the cross-correlations of the experimental and simulated data are larger than for the target due to the non-uniform distributions that result from a non-ideal setup and CGH. One can notice a small rotation (\u223c 5\u25e6) in the measured spatial cross-correlations, which is due to experimental alignment imperfections. All figures, except for the CGH, are in the EMCCD pixel basis, with a pixel size of 16 \u03bcm\u00d716 \u03bcm. The color bar for the CGH frames (B) and (F) correspond to the 8-bit encoding of the phase in the range of 0 to 2\u03c0.

DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adf9161\n             \n\n\nThe researchers used two entangled beams of light, meaning that the light waves are interconnected with correlations that are stronger than those that can be achieved with classical light and remain interconnected despite their distance apart.\n\"The advantage of the approach we introduce is that you're not able to recover the encoded information unless you perform joint measurements of the two entangled beams,\" Marino said. \"This has applications such as secure communication, given that if you were to measure each beam by itself, you would not be able to extract any information. You have to obtain the shared information between both of the beams and combine it in the right way to extract the encoded information.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThrough a series of images and correlation measurements, the researchers demonstrated results of successfully encoding information in these quantum-entangled beams of light. Only when the two beams were combined using the methods intended did the information resolve into recognizable information encoded in the form of images.\n\"The experimental result describes how one can transfer spatial patterns from one optical field to two new optical fields generated using a quantum mechanical process called four-wave mixing,\" said Nirala. \"The encoded spatial pattern can be retrieved solely by joint measurements of generated fields. One interesting aspect of this experiment is that it offers a novel method of encoding information in light by modifying the correlation between various spatial modes without impacting time-correlations.\"\n\"What this could enable, in principle, is the ability to securely encode and transmit a lot of information using the spatial properties of the light, just like how an image contains a lot more information than just turning the light on and off,\" Marino said. \"Using the spatial correlations is a new approach to encode information.\"\n\"Information encoding in the spatial correlations of entangled twin beams\" was published in Science Advances.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGaurav Nirala et al, Information encoding in the spatial correlations of entangled twin beams, Science Advances (2023).

Their unique design has paved the way for in-memory computing and captured significant interest from scientists and engineers alike.\nA new review article published in Nature Photonics, titled \"Integrated Optical Memristors,\" sheds light on the evolution of this technology\u2014and the work that still needs to be done for it to reach its full potential.\nLed by Nathan Youngblood, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Pittsburgh Swanson School of Engineering, the article explores the potential of optical devices which are analogs of electronic memristors. This new class of device could play a major role in revolutionizing high-bandwidth neuromorphic computing, machine learning hardware, and artificial intelligence in the optical domain.\n\"Researchers are truly captivated by optical memristors because of their incredible potential in high-bandwidth neuromorphic computing, machine learning hardware, and artificial intelligence,\" explained Youngblood. \"Imagine merging the incredible advantages of optics with local information processing. It's like opening the door to a whole new realm of technological possibilities that were previously unimaginable.\"\nThe review article presents a comprehensive overview of recent progress in this emerging field of photonic integrated circuits. It explores the current state-of-the-art and highlights the potential applications of optical memristors, which combine the benefits of ultrafast, high-bandwidth optical communication with local information processing. However, scalability emerged as the most pressing issue that future research should address.\n\"Scaling up in-memory or neuromorphic computing in the optical domain is a huge challenge. Having a technology that is fast, compact, and efficient makes scaling more achievable and would represent a huge step forward,\" explained Youngblood.\n\"One example of the limitations is that if you were to take phase change materials, which currently have the highest storage density for optical memory, and try to implement a relatively simplistic neural network on-chip, it would take a wafer the size of a laptop to fit all the memory cells needed,\" he continued. \"Size matters for photonics, and we need to find a way to improve the storage density, energy efficiency, and programming speed to do useful computing at useful scales.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nUsing light to revolutionize computing\nOptical memristors can revolutionize computing and information processing across several applications. They can enable active trimming of photonic integrated circuits (PICs), allowing for on-chip optical systems to be adjusted and reprogrammed as needed without continuously consuming power. They also offer high-speed data storage and retrieval, promising to accelerate processing, reduce energy consumption, and enable parallel processing.\nOptical memristors can even be used for artificial synapses and brain-inspired architectures. Dynamic memristors with nonvolatile storage and nonlinear output replicate the long-term plasticity of synapses in the brain and pave the way for spiking integrate-and-fire computing architectures.\nResearch to scale up and improve optical memristor technology could unlock unprecedented possibilities for high-bandwidth neuromorphic computing, machine learning hardware, and artificial intelligence.\n\"We looked at a lot of different technologies. The thing we noticed is that we're still far away from the target of an ideal optical memristor\u2013something that is compact, efficient, fast, and changes the optical properties in a significant manner,\" Youngblood said. \"We're still searching for a material or a device that actually meets all these criteria in a single technology in order for it to drive the field forward.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNathan Youngblood et al, Integrated optical memristors, Nature Photonics (2023).

Findings such as these can be applied in the development of mobile phones, televisions, satellites, and in medical diagnostic technology.\nThe quantum effect observed here is known as a Feshbach resonance. \"For a brief moment after colliding, the hydrogen molecule and noble gas atom form a chemical bond and then separate again,\" explains Professor Koch of Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin.\nHowever, despite the extremely detailed measurements and calculations for a comparatively small and simple system, researchers are still a long way from being able to reconstruct the full quantum mechanical characteristics of the hydrogen-noble gas collision. \"This is due to one of the fundamental phenomena of quantum mechanics: when it comes to measurements, you can't get around the basic principles of classical physics. That creates a dilemma: We are able to describe certain phenomena of quantum mechanics mathematically in abstract terms, but still need to use concepts from classical physics to fully understand them,\" Koch explains.\nQuantum effects\u2014meaning types of behavior that cannot be explained with the rules of classical physics\u2014appear when atoms and molecules can no longer be sufficiently described by the place they occupy and the speed at which they move. \"They display characteristics that we associate with wave dispersion, such as interference, meaning the constructive or destructive layering of waves,\" says Koch. On top of that, there are other phenomena such as entanglement, which happens when quantum mechanical objects exert immediate influence on one another despite being spatially distant.\nQuantum effects typically appear in the realm of very small objects such as atoms and molecules, and when these objects are under little influence from their environment. The latter is achieved for very short bursts of time or under extremely low temperatures near absolute zero (-273.15\u00b0C). \"Under these circumstances, only a small amount of so-called quantum states are available to these particles. The system basically behaves in an orderly way,\" says Koch.\nHigher temperatures allow for greater numbers of quantum states in the particles, and quantum mechanical effects tend to even out when distributed as a statistical average across various states, and thus essentially disappear from view. In this state, the system behaves more randomly and can be described using statistics. So far, even the coldest atom-molecule collisions have displayed this statistically predictable behavior. \"That has made it nearly impossible to come to any conclusions as to the interaction between the atoms and molecules, meaning we couldn't make a direct connection between real-life experimental data and theoretical models,\" Koch explains.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBaruch Margulis et al, Tomography of Feshbach resonance states, Science (2023).

   "text": "Outside atomic nuclei, neutrons are unstable particles, with a lifetime of about fifteen minutes. The neutron disintegrates due to the weak nuclear force, leaving behind a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. The weak nuclear force is one of the four fundamental forces in the universe, along with the strong force, the electromagnetic force, and the gravitational force.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing experimental measurements of neutron decay with theoretical predictions based on the weak nuclear force can reveal as-yet undiscovered interactions. To do so, researchers must achieve extremely high levels of precision. A team of nuclear theorists has uncovered a new, relatively large effect in neutron decay that arises from the interplay of the weak and electromagnetic forces.\nThis research identified a shift in the strength with which a spinning neutron experiences the weak nuclear force. This has two major implications. First, scientists have known since 1956 that due to the weak force, a system and one built like its mirror image do not behave in the same way. In other words, mirror reflection symmetry is broken. This research affects the search for new interactions, technically known as \"right-handed currents,\" that, at very short distances of less than one hundred quadrillionths of a centimeter, restore the universe's mirror-reflection symmetry. Second, this research points to the need to compute electromagnetic effects with higher precision. Doing so will require the use of future high-performance computers.\nA team of researchers computed the impact of electromagnetic interactions on neutron decay due to the emission and absorption of photons, the quanta of light. The team included nuclear theorists from the Institute for Nuclear Theory at the University of Washington, North Carolina State University, the University of Amsterdam, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and their results have been published in Physical Review Letters.\nThe calculation was performed with a modern method, known as \"effective field theory,\" that efficiently organizes the importance of fundamental interactions in phenomena involving strongly interacting particles. The team identified a new percent-level shift to the nucleon axial coupling, gA, which governs the strength of decay of a spinning neutron. The new correction originates from the emission and absorption of electrically charged pions, which are mediators of the strong nuclear force. While effective field theory provides an estimate of the uncertainties, improving on the current precision will require advanced calculations on Department of Energy supercomputers.\nThe researchers also assessed the impact on searches of right-handed current. They found that after including the new correction, experimental data and theory are in good agreement and current uncertainties still allow for new physics at a relatively low mass scale.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVincenzo Cirigliano et al, Pion-Induced Radiative Corrections to Neutron \u03b2 Decay, Physical Review Letters (2022).

The ultimate goal is to understand how complex forms of matter emerge from elementary particles affected by strong forces.\nTheoretical calculations involving the strong force are complex. One aspect of this complexity arises because there are many ways to perform these calculations. Scientists refer to some of these as gauge choices. All gauge choices should produce the same result for the calculation of any quantity that can be measured in an experiment. However, one particular choice, called axial gauge, has puzzled scientists for years because of difficulties in obtaining consistent results upon making this choice.\nA recent study, published in Physical Review Letters, resolves this puzzle and paves the way for reliable calculations of hot and cold nuclear matter properties that can be tested in current and future experiments.\nThe exotic form of nuclear matter that physicists study in relativistic heavy ion collisions is called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). This form of matter existed in the early universe. Physicists explore its properties in heavy ion collision experiments by recreating the extremely high temperatures last seen microseconds after the Big Bang. By analyzing experimental data from the collisions and comparing them with theoretical calculations, physicists can ascertain various properties of the QGP. A calculation method called axial gauge had previously seemed to imply that two QGP properties that describe how heavy quarks move through the QGP were the same.\nResearchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Washington have now found this implication to be incorrect. Their study also carefully analyzed the subtle conditions for when axial gauge can be employed and explained why the two properties are different. Finally, it showed that two distinct methods for measuring how gluons, which are particles that carry the strong force, are distributed inside nuclei must yield different results. This prediction will be tested at the future electron-ion collider.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBruno Scheihing-Hitschfeld et al, Gauge Invariance of Non-Abelian Field Strength Correlators: The Axial Gauge Puzzle, Physical Review Letters (2023).

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in employing neural networks for computational modeling of fluids. The results of a collaboration between researchers from Eindhoven University of Technology and Los Alamos National Laboratory, published in The European Physical Journal E, show how neural networks can be embedded into a LBM framework to model collisions between fluid particles.\nThe team found that it is essential to embed the correct physical properties into the neural network architecture to preserve accuracy. These discoveries could deepen researchers' understanding of how to model fluid flows.\nThe LBM works by dividing flows into grids of tiny cells: tracking the movement of particles between cells, then calculating how the distribution of particles in each cell changes over time. One of the LBM's key requirements is to model collisions between particles. Several different models are now capable of doing this, and by appropriately recreating these collisions within the LBM, researchers can now use them to model a diverse array of flow systems.\nIn their study, the Eindhoven and Los Alamos teams assessed the reliability of this approach by using the LBM to model time-varying behavior in a variety of complex flows. They discovered that 'vanilla' neural network architectures, with no enforcement of physical properties, have a very limited accuracy when calculating particle collisions.\nYet by embedding the unique physical properties of real flows\u2014including conservation laws and spatial symmetries\u2014their accuracy in reproducing time-varying dynamics can improve by some 4 orders of magnitude.

The technology works by sending high-frequency sound waves from a transducer and listening for the echoes created at the interface between tissues of different densities.\nBased on the time it takes for the echoes to return, the computer can reconstruct the image. However, one of the major drawbacks of ultrasound is its low resolution, which means that contrast agents, like microbubbles, are used for echocardiograms or liver scans. A better theoretical understanding of the physics of the interaction between encapsulated microbubbles, which possess a thick shell, and sound waves is still needed to create better contrast agents.\nNow, researchers at the University of Tsukuba have derived new nonlinear equations that take into account the compressibility of the shell layer to extend its applicability to multiple bubbles. The researchers chose this path because previous work did not model realistic properties for the bubble surface. \"We modeled the shell as a viscoelastic object, which turned out to be an important factor in the analysis,\" author Professor Tetsuya Kanagawa says.\nCompressibility measures the relative change in volume of fluid or solid in response to an increase or decrease in pressure. Other research projects tended to focus on the deformations of the bubble's interior, while neglecting the bubble itself. The researchers found that the effect of including the shell in the calculations led to an increase in attenuation (dissipation) coefficient.\n\"Our work helps pave the way for future refinements to the theory of sound attenuation in liquids,\" Professor Kanagawa says. The microbubbles studied in this project might also be converted to therapeutic uses, such as targeted drug delivery. In that case, sound waves could cause the bubbles to burst at specific times or locations in the body, releasing the drug.\nThe work is published in Physics of Fluids.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTetsuya Kanagawa et al, Nonlinear acoustic theory on flowing liquid containing multiple microbubbles coated by a compressible visco-elastic shell: Low and high frequency cases, Physics of Fluids (2022).

   "text": "Physicists analyzing data from gold ion smashups at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science user facility for nuclear physics research at DOE's Brookhaven National Laboratory, are searching for evidence that nails down a so-called critical point in the way nuclear matter changes from one phase to another.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew findings from members of RHIC's STAR Collaboration published in Physical Review Letters hint that calculations predicting how many lightweight nuclei should emerge from collisions could help mark that spot on the roadmap of nuclear phase changes. Proof of a critical point\u2014a point where there's a change in the way nuclear matter transforms from one phase to another\u2014is key to answering fundamental questions about the makeup of our universe.\n\"You can imagine the nuclear phase diagram as a bridge connecting the past\u2014the Big Bang and the early universe\u2014to visible matter as we know it today, and even neutron stars,\" said Xiaofeng Luo, a member of RHIC's STAR Collaboration from Central China Normal University (CCNU), who led a group of students in this analysis. \"It's important scientifically and to human understanding of where we come from.\"\nCritical point search party\nRHIC's collisions recreate a hot, dense state of matter that existed for a tiny fraction of a second right after the Big Bang some 14 billion years ago. This matter, called a quark-gluon plasma (QGP), is a soup of \"free\" quarks and gluons\u2014the building blocks of the protons and neutrons that make up atomic nuclei. Colliding heavy ions at various energies allows RHIC physicists to study how the collisions create this primordial soup and how it transitions back into ordinary nuclear matter.\nTo look for signs of a critical point\u2014where the type of transition from QGP to ordinary matter changes from a smooth crossover (where two phases coexist, as when butter gradually melts on a warm day) to a sudden shift (like water suddenly boiling)\u2014the scientists look for fluctuations in things they measure coming out of the collisions.\nA previous study found tantalizing signs of the type of fluctuations scientists would expect around the critical point by looking at the number of net protons produced at the various collision energies. Protons, each made of three quarks, form as the QGP cools, and can serve as stand-ins for the overall baryon density (baryons being all particles made of three quarks, which also includes neutrons).\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nScientists expect that as the baryon density of matter increases, it's more likely these protons and neutrons will coalesce, or come together, to form lightweight nuclei when the QGP \"freezes out.\" So, in this study, they tried to track the yield of one type of lightweight nucleus known as a triton\u2014made of one proton and two neutrons. Seeing fluctuation patterns in triton production might help them zero in on the critical point.\nAs in the previous study, the data were collected by the Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC, a particle detector known as STAR, during phase one of the Beam Energy Scan (BES-I). This program recorded snapshots of collisions at various energies and temperatures from 2010 to 2017, capturing changes in the numbers and types of particles streaming out. This new analysis builds upon a paper that Brookhaven physicist Zhangbu Xu and colleagues published in 2017, predicting that the yield ratio of light nuclei such as tritons should be tied to the critical point.\n\"The formation of these light nuclei requires a certain baryon density,\" said Dingwei Zhang, a member of RHIC's STAR Collaboration and Ph.D. student at CCNU. \"If the system is approaching the critical point, the baryon density fluctuates a lot. So, we wanted to see through this analysis if we will see the fluctuations, therefore pin down the critical point.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                Tracking fluctuations in the yield ratio of lightweight nuclei such as deuterons and tritons emerging from collisions within the STAR detector should be sensitive to a critical point. The data (red points) mostly match predictions (shaded areas), but two outlying points may be signs of the types of fluctuations scientists expect to see around the critical point. Credit: Brookhaven National Laboratory\n             \n\n\nThe data at most of the collision energies analyzed matched theorists' models of how new nuclei would form as protons and neutrons come together through coalescence. But at two points\u2014from collisions at 19.6 billion election volts (GeV) and 27 GeV\u2014the data jumped out of the baseline predicted by the model, hinting at those coveted fluctuations.\nThe points offer a combined significance that still falls below the level required to claim a physics discovery.\n\"We hoped this analysis would be sensitive to the critical point,\" Luo said. \"We are very happy to see these outliers here and it's certainly encouraging. Eventually, if the critical point exists in the energy range we covered, all these observables should give a consistent signal.\"\nResearchers are looking forward to seeing what analyses of a plethora of additional collision data will show. In 2021, the STAR collaboration successfully completed the second phase of the Beam Energy Scan (BES II), which captured gold smashup snapshots at various RHIC energies, including the lowest energy of 3 GeV.\n\"We hope that the BES II data will help us enhance the sensitivity to a critical point signal,\" Luo said. \"With higher statistics, we may be able to reach the level of significance required to claim a discovery. And that would be big.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tM. I.

   "text": "Polarized electrons are electrons in which spins have a \"preferred\" orientation or are preferentially oriented in a specific direction. The realization of these electrons has notable implications for physics research, as it can pave the way toward the creation of promising materials and enable new experiments.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers at East China Normal University and Henan Academy of Sciences recently introduced a new method to polarize free electrons in a laboratory setting using near-field optical techniques, which entails the application of light beams from an optical device positioned close to a sample. Their paper, published in Physical Review Letters, could open interesting new possibilities for high-energy physics, quantum technology development and materials science.\n\"The initial idea for this study took root two years ago while I was a Postdoctoral researcher in Prof. Francisco Javier Garcia de Abajo's group, renowned for their theoretical work on optical excitations in electron beams,\" Deng Pan, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org. \"Since then, the field of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM) has gained momentum, emerging as a prominent topic in electron microscopy.\"\nPINEM is a promising microscopy technique that could allow researchers to manipulate the quantum properties of electrons, which could potentially unveil new quantum computing mechanisms that rely on free electrons. Previous works primarily tried to use this technique to manipulate the orbitals and momenta of electrons. In their study, Pan and his colleague Hongxing Xu set out to explore its potential use for polarizing free electrons.\n\"I began to question whether a similar approach could be employed to alter the spin state of electrons or even polarize electron beams,\" Pan said. \"Engaging in discussions with several experts in electron beam theory, most of them believed such an effect to be undetectable, given that the magnetic field within the electromagnetic field is significantly weaker than the electric field component. Consequently, it was both surprising and unexpected that my calculations ultimately demonstrated the substantial electron polarization effect within the optical near-field.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe optical method introduced by Pan and Xu draws inspiration from PINEM, as it is based on a similar approach. The researchers used a nanowire array (i.e., a periodic nanostructure) with a carefully designed lattice constant. Their design ensured a near-field match between the input electron velocity and the structure, ensuring a strong interaction between them.\n\"There is a fundamental difference between my proposal and the PINEM scheme,\" Pan explained. \"The PINEM effect is induced by the electric field component parallel to the electron beam. In contrast, we utilized a transverse electric (TE) near-field, which only possesses the electric field perpendicular to the electron beam. Why did we opt for this TE near-field? The answer is closely linked to another fascinating topic in nanophotonics known as transverse spin angular momentum or spin-orbit interaction in optical near-fields.\"\nThe TE near-field applied by the researchers has a circularly polarized magnetic field. As a result, it can be used to manipulate the spins of electrons, just as other fields can be used to control quantum spins.\n\"A spin electron beam proves to be an invaluable tool in studying magnetic materials and high-energy physics, among other areas,\" Pan said. \"Our research also sheds light on the realization that, although weaker in comparison to the electric field component, the magnetic field component in the optical near-field can be leveraged to achieve unforeseen outcomes.\"\nPan and Xu are among the first to introduce a reliable optical method to prepare spin electrons in a laboratory environment. In the future, their approach could be adapted and used by other research teams to create spin-polarized electron beams, while potentially also inspiring the development of new quantum computing approaches that leverage both the spins of electrons and photons.\n\"With the direction provided by this work, there is still an extensive theoretical space to explore, such as the potential for quantum information processing combining electron and photon spins,\" Pan added. \"However, I believe the most crucial aspect is the experimental demonstration of the proposal outlined in this study. I have already discussed this work with several experimentalists, and they have expressed optimism regarding the feasibility of achieving our results in experiments.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDeng Pan et al, Polarizing Free Electrons in Optical Near Fields, Physical Review Letters (2023).

These include quantum materials such as superconductors and magnets, as well as low-dimensional materials such as graphene and metal nanostructures.\n\"Although a variety of nonlinear optical spectroscopies exists, terahertz emission allows you to probe material properties and dynamics that can remain hidden to other techniques,\" said one of the paper's co-lead authors, Jacob Pettine. \"This method has therefore become quite important for interrogating novel materials.\"\nThe central concept of THz emission spectroscopy is the rectification of high-frequency optical fields into low-frequency fields, similar to the rectification required to convert alternating (AC) currents from the wall into directional (DC) currents that can power devices or charge batteries. Underlying any rectification process is a broken symmetry\u2014often a spatial mirror/inversion symmetry, though time-reversal symmetry breaking becomes key in magnetic systems.\n\"At the most basic level, the emission of terahertz radiation requires some sort of directionality in your material, in space and/or time,\" co-lead author Nicholas Sirica noted. \"So, if you get any terahertz light out, it immediately tells you something about the symmetry of the system.\"\nCo-lead author Prashant Padmanabhan added, \"You can then gain detailed insights into material structure, electronic and magnetic properties, and light-matter interactions by measuring the emitted THz field in response to different incident light polarization, frequency, or amplitude.\"\nA complementary theme explored in the review is the interplay between intrinsic (i.e., atomic lattice) and extrinsic (artificial/nanoscale) structuring, where artificial structuring can introduce new symmetries and enhance THz current responses that might be otherwise weak or forbidden in the intrinsic/bulk material.\nSo far, the emphasis has primarily been on exploring either (i) complex bulk properties of emerging quantum materials, or (ii) intricate behaviors that can occur in low-dimensional/nanostructured forms of relatively simple metals, semimetals, or semiconductors. One goal of this review is to highlight opportunities at the intersection of these ideas.\n\"In this review paper, we aim to provide an overview of the essential systems and basic mechanisms explored thus far via THz emission,\" noted Chen. \"We also try to highlight opportunities for designing such material and light-matter interaction symmetries in artificially structured systems, such as plasmonic metasurfaces.\"\nThe interplay between intrinsic, extrinsic, and hybrid material structuring may stimulate the discovery of exotic properties and phenomena beyond existing material paradigms, the paper notes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJacob Pettine et al, Ultrafast terahertz emission from emerging symmetry-broken materials, Light: Science & Applications (2023).

However, as the components of these microchips shrink, it becomes more difficult to inspect and test them using traditional imaging techniques.\nOne promising method for imaging nanoscale components is synchrotron X-ray ptychographic tomography, which uses high-energy X-rays to penetrate the material and create detailed images of the internal structure. However, X-ray imaging is a slow process that requires precise positioning of the sample and the detector, and can take hours or even days to get a single reconstruction.\nTo speed up this process, the MIT and Argonne researchers turned to machine learning. They trained a neural network to predict accurate reconstructions of the objects in a fraction of the time it would normally take. Their network is called APT or Attentional Ptycho-Tomography, which utilizes regularizing priors in the form of typical patterns found in integrated circuit interiors, and the physics of X-ray propagation through the object.\n\"The neural network is able to learn from a small amount of data and generalize, which allows us to image and reconstruct the integrated circuits quickly,\" said Iksung Kang, the lead author of the paper.

   "text": "The thorium isotope with the mass number 229 (229Th) is highly exciting in many respects\u2014for fundamental physics as well as for future applications, for example in the sense of a nuclear clock.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn international German-Chinese-American research team with the participation of Prof. Dr. Dmitry Budker's group at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz has now proposed a completely new approach to study 229Th in detail. The researchers want to use thorium ions that have only three electrons left in their shell out of 90 present in a neutral atom.\nSuch a system offers many advantages, the researchers report in the current issue of the journal Physical Review Research, most notably that the first nuclear transition can be excited with conventional lasers in the visible wavelength range. This, however, requires the ions to be circulating in a relativistic storage ring.\nA test laboratory for new physics\nWhat is special about thorium-229 is that its atomic nucleus, with the metastable isomeric state thorium-229m has by far the lowest excited energy level of all the approximately 3,800 atomic nuclei currently known. It is therefore the only nuclear transition that can potentially be interrogated with lasers\u2014even without using storage rings. The extremely precise measurement of this transition and the two nuclear states opens up promising and diverse perspectives.\nTo this end, the researchers led by Dmitry Budker are now proposing a new approach\u2014both in terms of the \"object of study\" and the experimental setting: they are using highly charged ions, or HCIs for short, specifically those in which there are only three electrons left in the electron shell. In such highly charged thorium ions, the interplay between the electron and the nucleus opens some new transitions that can be used to \"populate\" the nuclear isomeric state efficiently.\nThe idea is to accelerate these thorium ions to almost the speed of light in a particle accelerator. In this way, they develop a leverage effect, so to speak, in order to excite them as effectively as possible with a conventional laser and thus be able to study them very precisely. Most importantly, multiple excited states can be addressed and used to \"populate\" the isomeric state that is actually of interest.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nMost previous studies of thorium-229m have dealt with non-relativistic atoms or ions in low charge states, which places high demands on the light source required for excitation\u2014because an extremely short-wavelength laser in the deep ultraviolet range is needed. \"The fact that we can use a laser in the visible\u2014conventional\u2014wavelength range instead makes spectroscopic studies easier,\" explains Dmitry Budker.\n\"That this is possible at all is related to the fact that the thorium ions are accelerated to almost the speed of light. Due to relativistic effects, they perceive a laser beam directed at them from the front as a beam with a much shorter wavelength: for them, conventional laser light appears like a UV laser,\" adds first author Junlan Jin, currently a Ph.D. student at Princeton University, who previously worked very closely and successfully with Dmitry Budker's group as part of a remote internship.\nIn the current publication, the authors describe the various steps required to realize their method: They start with the generation of an accelerated beam of highly charged thorium ions, with possible accelerator rings being at the FAIR facility under construction at GSI in Darmstadt, Germany, or the planned Gamma Factory at CERN\u2014the authors of the current thorium publication are also involved in the conceptual proposals for the realization of such a \"super light source.\"\nThey then discuss in detail various scenarios for obtaining the most complete possible excitation of thorium nuclei, before focusing on the detection of the excited states produced and the transferability to similar systems.\nThe research team's conclusion: According to their estimate, the energy of the isomeric state can be measured with a precision better than 10-4 or even down to below 10-6, which is orders of magnitude improvement of the present value. This would pave the way for further improvements in determining the energy of the isomeric state and help answer fundamental physics questions using the thorium system.\n\"The development of a nuclear clock is not so much the focus of our proposal, because for its realization our new method brings various technological challenges,\" adds Dmitry Budker.\n\"For us, however, thorium is a very large 'playground' for addressing fundamental physics questions, a test lab for new physics, so to speak. For example, we want to answer the question of whether certain fundamental constants of nature are perhaps not so constant, but drift or oscillate with time or with location. In addition, one can imagine tests of fundamental symmetries and searches for particles or fields that go beyond the Standard Model.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJunlan Jin et al, Excitation and probing of low-energy nuclear states at high-energy storage rings, Physical Review Research (2023).

   "text": "Within superconductors little tornadoes of electrons, known as quantum vortices, can occur which have important implications in superconducting applications such as quantum sensors. Now a new kind of superconducting vortex has been found, an international team of researchers reports.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEgor Babaev, professor at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, says the study revises the prevailing understanding of how electronic flow can occur in superconductors, based on work about quantum vortices that was recognized in the 2003 Nobel Prize award. The researchers at KTH, together with researchers from Stanford University, TD Lee Institute in Shanghai and AIST in Tsukuba, discovered that the magnetic flux produced by vortices in a superconductor can be divided up into a wider range of values than thought.\nThat represents a new insight into the fundamentals of superconductivity, and also potentially can be applied in superconducting electronics.\nA vortex of magnetic flux happens when an external magnetic field is applied to a superconductor. The magnetic field penetrates the superconductor in the form of quantized magnetic flux tubes which form vortices. Babaev says that originally research held that quantum vortices pass through superconductors each carrying one quantum of magnetic flux. But arbitrary fractions of quantum flux were not a possibility entertained in earlier theories of superconductivity.\nUsing the Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) at Stanford University Babaev's co-authors, research scientist Yusuke Iguchi and Professor Kathryn A. Moler, showed at a microscopic level that quantum vortices can exist in a single electronic band. The team was able to create and move around these fractional quantum vortices, Moler says.\n\"Professor Babaev has been telling me for years that we could see something like this, but I didn't believe it until Dr. Iguchi actually saw it and conducted a number of detailed checks,\" she says.\nThe Stanford researchers found the initial observation of this phenomenon \"so incredibly uncommon,\" says Iguchi, that they repeated the experiment 75 times in at various locations and temperatures.\nThe work confirms a prediction Babaev published 20 years ago, which held that in certain kinds of crystals, one part of an electron population of a superconducting material can form a clockwise circulating vortex, while other electrons can form a counter-clockwise vortex simultaneously. \"These combined quantum tornadoes can carry an arbitrary fraction of flux quantum,\" he says.\n\"That revises of our understanding of quantum vortices in superconductors,\" he says.\nMoler affirmed that conclusion. \"I have been looking at vortices in novel superconductors for over 25 years, and I have never seen this before,\" she says.\nBabaev says that the robustness of quantum vortices and the possibility to control them suggests that quantum vortices could potentially be used as information carriers in superconducting computers.\n\"The knowledge that we gain, the spectacular methods that were introduced by our colleagues Dr. Iguchi and Professor Moler at Stanford, may in a long run be potentially helpful for certain platforms for quantum computation,\" Babaev says.\nThe study is published in the journal Science.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYusuke Iguchi, Superconducting vortices carrying a temperature-dependent fraction of the flux quantum, Science (2023).

   "text": "Darmstadt physicists have developed a technique that could overcome one of the biggest hurdles in building a practically-relevant quantum computer. They make use of an optical effect here discovered by British photo pioneer William Talbot in 1836. The team led by Malte Schlosser and Gerhard Birkl from the Institute of Applied Physics at Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt presents this success in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantum computers are able to solve certain tasks much quicker even than supercomputers. However, there have so far only been prototypes with a maximum of a few hundred \"qubits.\" These are the basic units of information in quantum computing, corresponding to \"bits\" in classical computing. However, unlike bits, qubits can process the two values \"0\" or \"1\" simultaneously instead of one after the other, which enables quantum computers to perform a great many calculations in parallel.\nQuantum computers with many thousands, if not several millions, of qubits would be required for practical applications, such as optimizing complex traffic flows. However, adding qubits consumes resources, such as laser output, which has so far hampered the development of quantum computers. The Darmstadt team has now shown how the optical Talbot effect can be used to increase the number of qubits from several hundred to over ten thousand without proportionally requiring additional resources.\nQubits can be realized in different ways. Tech giants such as Google, for instance, use artificially manufactured superconducting circuit elements. However, individual atoms are also excellent for this purpose. To control these in a targeted manner, single-atom qubits must be held in a regular lattice, similar to a chess board.\nPhysicists usually use an \"optical lattice\" of regularly arranged points of light for this, which is formed when laser beams cross each other. \"If you want to increase the number of qubits by a certain factor, you also have to correspondingly increase the laser output,\" explains Birkl.\nHis team produces the optical lattice in an innovative way. They shine a laser onto a glass element the size of a fingernail, on which tiny optical lenses are arranged similar to a chess board. Each microlens bundles a small part of the laser beam, thereby creating a plane of focal points, which can hold atoms.\nNow, the Talbot effect is occurring on top, which has so far been considered a nuisance: the layer of focal points is repeated multiple times at equal intervals; what are known as \"self-images\" are created. Therefore, an optical lattice in 2D becomes one in 3D with many times the points of light. \"We get that for free,\" says Malte Schlosser, the lead author of the work. He means that no additional laser output is required for this.\nThe high manufacturing precision of microlenses leads to very regularly arranged self-images, which can be used for qubits. The researchers were able to indeed load the additional layers with individual atoms. With the given laser output, 16 of such free layers were created, potentially allowing for more than 10,000 qubits. According to Schlosser, conventional lasers can be used to quadruple the power in the future.\n\"The microlens field can also be optimized further,\" explains Birkl, such as by creating more focal points with smaller lenses. 100,000 qubits and more will therefore be possible in the foreseeable future. The scalability in the number of qubits shown by the team represents an important step towards developing practicable quantum computers.\nSchlosser emphasizes that the technology is not limited to quantum computers. \"Our platform could also potentially be applicable to high-precision optical atomic clocks.\" The Darmstadt team plans to further develop its new qubit platform and envisages a variety of possible applications in the field of quantum technologies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMalte Schlosser et al, Scalable Multilayer Architecture of Assembled Single-Atom Qubit Arrays in a Three-Dimensional Talbot Tweezer Lattice, Physical Review Letters (2023).

   "text": "University of Washington researchers have discovered they can detect atomic \"breathing,\" or the mechanical vibration between two layers of atoms, by observing the type of light those atoms emitted when stimulated by a laser. The sound of this atomic \"breath\" could help researchers encode and transmit quantum information.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers also developed a device that could serve as a new type of building block for quantum technologies, which are widely anticipated to have many future applications in fields such as computing, communications and sensor development.\nThe researchers published these findings June 1 in Nature Nanotechnology.\n\"This is a new, atomic-scale platform, using what the scientific community calls 'optomechanics,' in which light and mechanical motions are intrinsically coupled together,\" said senior author Mo Li, a UW professor of both electrical and computer engineering and physics. \"It provides a new type of involved quantum effect that can be utilized to control single photons running through integrated optical circuits for many applications.\"\nPreviously, the team had studied a quantum-level quasiparticle called an \"exciton.\" Information can be encoded into an exciton and then released in the form of a photon\u2014a tiny particle of energy considered to be the quantum unit of light. Quantum properties of each photon emitted \u2014such as the photon's polarization, wavelength and/or emission timing\u2014can function as a quantum bit of information, or \"qubit,\" for quantum computing and communication. And because this qubit is carried by a photon, it travels at the speed of light.\n\"The bird's-eye view of this research is that to feasibly have a quantum network, we need to have ways of reliably creating, operating on, storing and transmitting qubits,\" said lead author Adina Ripin, a UW doctoral student of physics. \"Photons are a natural choice for transmitting this quantum information because optical fibers enable us to transport photons long distances at high speeds, with low losses of energy or information.\"\nThe researchers were working with excitons in order to create a single photon emitter, or \"quantum emitter,\" which is a critical component for quantum technologies based on light and optics. To do this, the team placed two thin layers of tungsten and selenium atoms, known as tungsten diselenide, on top of each other.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the researchers applied a precise pulse of laser light, they knocked a tungsten diselenide atom's electron away from the nucleus, which generated an exciton quasiparticle. Each exciton consisted of a negatively charged electron on one layer of the tungsten diselenide and a positively charged hole where the electron used to be on the other layer. And because opposite charges attract each other, the electron and the hole in each exciton were tightly bonded to each other. After a short moment, as the electron dropped back into the hole it previously occupied, the exciton emitted a single photon encoded with quantum information\u2014producing the quantum emitter the team sought to create.\nBut the team discovered that the tungsten diselenide atoms were emitting another type of quasiparticle, known as a phonon. Phonons are a product of atomic vibration, which is similar to breathing. Here, the two atomic layers of the tungsten diselenide acted like tiny drumheads vibrating relative to each other, which generated phonons. This is the first time phonons have ever been observed in a single photon emitter in this type of two-dimensional atomic system.\nWhen the researchers measured the spectrum of the emitted light, they noticed several equally spaced peaks. Every single photon emitted by an exciton was coupled with one or more phonons. This is somewhat akin to climbing a quantum energy ladder one rung at a time, and on the spectrum, these energy spikes were represented visually by the equally spaced peaks.\n\"A phonon is the natural quantum vibration of the tungsten diselenide material, and it has the effect of vertically stretching the exciton electron-hole pair sitting in the two layers,\" said Li, who is also is a member of the steering committee for the UW's QuantumX, and is a faculty member of the Institute for Nano-Engineered Systems. \"This has a remarkably strong effect on the optical properties of the photon emitted by the exciton that has never been reported before.\"\nThe researchers were curious if they could harness the phonons for quantum technology. They applied electrical voltage and saw that they could vary the interaction energy of the associated phonons and emitted photons. These variations were measurable and controllable in ways relevant to encoding quantum information into a single photon emission and this was all accomplished in one integrated system\u2014a device that involved only a small number of atoms.\nNext the team plans to build a waveguide\u2014fibers on a chip that catch single photon emissions and direct them where they need to go\u2014and then scale up the system. Instead of controlling only one quantum emitter at a time, the team wants to be able to control multiple emitters and their associated phonon states. This will enable the quantum emitters to \"talk\" to each other, a step toward building a solid base for quantum circuitry.\n\"Our overarching goal is to create an integrated system with quantum emitters that can use single photons running through optical circuits and the newly discovered phonons to do quantum computing and quantum sensing,\" Li said. \"This advance certainly will contribute to that effort, and it helps to further develop quantum computing which, in the future, will have many applications.\"\nOther co-authors are Ruoming Peng, Xiaowei Zhang, Srivatsa Chakravarthi, Minhao He, Xiaodong Xu, Kai-Mei Fu and Ting Cao.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTunable phononic coupling in excitonic quantum emitters, Nature Nanotechnology (2023).

   "text": "Researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and KLA Corporation, a provider of inspection and measurement systems for the semiconductor and related industries, have improved the accuracy of scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements. Used for process control applications in semiconductor manufacturing, SEMs help ensure high-yield production of functional, high-performance chips.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA SEM uses a focused electron beam to image features as small as one nanometer, making it an important instrument for characterizing semiconductor device structures. During chip manufacturing, high-resolution SEMs are used for many inspection and metrology applications, including detection of very small defects, identification and classification of defects found by optical inspectors, critical dimension measurements of pattern features, overlay measurements, and more. This information helps chip engineers characterize and fine tune their manufacturing processes.\nAs the electron beam travels through a SEM, it is carefully controlled. A slight deviation of the electron beam from the ideal path or a tiny misalignment of the angle at which the beam strikes the surface of the chip can distort the resulting SEM image and misrepresent the structure of the device. NIST and KLA improved the accuracy of SEMs by accounting for these angular misalignments of the electron beam. The joint research project measures beam tilt with an accuracy of less than one milliradian, or five hundredths of a degree, which required advances in angular resolution and measurement validation.\nTo measure the beam tilt, NIST and KLA created a prototype standard for electron microscopy and analyzed the resulting electron micrographs in a new way. The prototype standard consists of an array of tapering pillars of silicon, known as conical frusta, which form images that are highly sensitive to beam tilt. The tilt shows up as a shift between the centers of images of the top and bottom edges of a frustum. Using their expertise in modeling electron\u2013matter interactions, the researchers used simulations to demonstrate the potential for sub-milliradian accuracy, guiding their ongoing design and fabrication of the standard artifacts.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Simulation of a scanning electron micrograph showing the effect of electron beam tilt as a shift between the centers of the top and bottom edges of a frustum.

Those measurements could further calibrate the magnification and distortion of the electron microscope. Furthermore, the new standard has applications to other microscopy methods used in chip manufacturing, including atomic-force and super-resolution optical microscopy. The ability to compare the results of different microscopy methods helps to reliably and reproducibly transfer information between the different methods and improve the accuracy of measurement models.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Electron-beam tilt shifts the apparent positions of device features, reducing the accuracy of SEM measurements,\" said Andrew C. Madison, NIST researcher and first author on industry papers covering this research. \"Our new standard and analysis method can detect electron-beam shift as it varies across the imaging field.\"\n\"With this data, SEM manufacturers can implement calibrations and corrections that improve image quality and measurement accuracy,\" said NIST researcher and principal investigator Samuel M. Stavis.\n\"As experts in semiconductor inspection and metrology, we're continually exploring new technologies that can extend current measurement limits,\" said Yalin Xiong, senior vice president and general manager at KLA Corporation. \"Collaboration with research organizations serves an important role in discovering innovations that can help advance process control for the chip industry.

   "text": "Whether it's baking a cake, building a house, or developing a quantum device, the quality of the end product significantly depends on its ingredients or base materials. Researchers working to improve the performance of superconducting qubits, the foundation of quantum computers, have been experimenting using different base materials in an effort to increase the coherent lifetimes of qubits.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coherence time is a measure of how long a qubit retains quantum information, and thus a primary measure of performance. Recently, scientists discovered that using tantalum in superconducting qubits makes them perform better, but no one has been able to determine why\u2014until now.\nScientists from the Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN), the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II), the Co-design Center for Quantum Advantage (C2QA), and Princeton University investigated the fundamental reasons that these qubits perform better by decoding the chemical profile of tantalum.\nThe results of this work, which were recently published in the journal Advanced Science, will provide key knowledge for designing even better qubits in the future. CFN and NSLS-II are U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facilities at DOE's Brookhaven National Laboratory. C2QA is a Brookhaven-led national quantum information science research center, of which Princeton University is a key partner.\nFinding the right ingredient\nTantalum is a unique and versatile metal. It's dense, hard, and easy to work with. Tantalum also has a high melting point and is resistant to corrosion, making it useful in many commercial applications. In addition, tantalum is a superconductor, which means it has no electrical resistance when cooled to sufficiently low temperatures, and consequently can carry current without any energy loss.\nTantalum-based superconducting qubits have demonstrated record-long lifetimes of more than half a millisecond. That is five times longer than the lifetimes of qubits made with niobium and aluminum, which are currently deployed in large-scale quantum processors.\nThese properties make tantalum an excellent candidate material for building better qubits. Still, the goal of improving superconducting quantum computers has been hindered by a lack of understanding as to what is limiting qubit lifetimes, a process known as decoherence. Noise and microscopic sources of dielectric loss are generally thought to contribute; however, scientists are unsure exactly why and how.\n\"The work in this paper is one of two parallel studies aiming to address a grand challenge in qubit fabrication,\" explained Nathalie de Leon, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Princeton University and the materials thrust leader for C2QA. \"Nobody has proposed a microscopic, atomistic model for loss that explains all the observed behavior and then was able to show that their model limits a particular device. This requires measurement techniques that are precise and quantitative, as well as sophisticated data analysis.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nSurprising results\nTo get a better picture of the source of qubit decoherence, scientists at Princeton and CFN grew and chemically processed tantalum films on sapphire substrates. They then took these samples to the Spectroscopy Soft and Tender Beamlines (SST-1 and SST-2) at NSLS-II to study the tantalum oxide that formed on the surface using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS uses X-rays to kick electrons out of the sample and provides clues about the chemical properties and electronic state of atoms near the sample surface.\nThe scientists hypothesized that the thickness and chemical nature of this tantalum oxide layer played a role in determining the qubit coherence, as tantalum has a thinner oxide layer compared to the niobium more typically used in qubits.\n\"We measured these materials at the beamlines in order to better understand what was happening,\" explained Andrew Walter, a lead beamline scientist in NSLS-II's soft X-ray scattering & spectroscopy program. \"There was an assumption that the tantalum oxide layer was fairly uniform, but our measurements showed that it's not uniform at all. It's always more interesting when you uncover an answer you don't expect, because that's when you learn something.\"\nThe team found several different kinds of tantalum oxides at the surface of the tantalum, which has prompted a new set of questions on the path to creating better superconducting qubits. Can these interfaces be modified to improve overall device performance, and which modifications would provide the most benefit? What kinds of surface treatments can be used to minimize loss?\nEmbodying the spirit of codesign\n\"It was inspiring to see experts of very different backgrounds coming together to solve a common problem,\" said Mingzhao Liu, a materials scientist at CFN and the materials subthrust leader in C2QA. \"This was a highly collaborative effort, pooling together the facilities, resources, and expertise shared between all of our facilities. From a materials science standpoint, it was exciting to create these samples and be an integral part of this research.\"\nWalter said, \"Work like this speaks to the way C2QA was built. The electrical engineers from Princeton University contributed a lot to device management, design, data analysis, and testing. The materials group at CFN grew and processed samples and materials. My group at NSLS-II characterized these materials and their electronic properties.\"\nHaving these specialized groups come together not only made the study move smoothly and more efficiently, but it gave the scientists an understanding of their work in a larger context. Students and postdocs were able to get invaluable experience in several different areas and contribute to this research in meaningful ways.\n\"Sometimes, when materials scientists work with physicists, they'll hand off their materials and wait to hear back regarding results,\" said de Leon, \"but our team was working hand-in-hand, developing new methods along the way that could be broadly used at the beamline going forward.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRussell A.

   "text": "Electron microscopes give us insight into the tiniest details of materials and can visualize, for example, the structure of solids, molecules or nanoparticles with atomic resolution.

These interactions are defined by electrons pushed and pulled around by the oscillations of light, and the dynamics are extremely fast: light waves oscillate at attoseconds, the billionth of a billionth of a second.\nUntil now, it has been very difficult to directly visualize these extremely fast processes in space and time, but that is exactly what a team of physicists from the University of Konstanz has now succeeded in. They recorded movies with attosecond time resolution in a transmission electron microscope, providing new insights into the functionality of nanomaterials and dielectric meta-atoms. They recently published their results in Nature.\nGeneration of ultrashort electron pulses\n\"If you look closely, almost all phenomena in optics, nanophotonics or metamaterials occur on time scales below one oscillation period of a light wave,\" explains Peter Baum, physics professor and head of the Light and Matter Group at the University of Konstanz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField dynamics of a plasmonic needle.

After some time, they convert into a train of ultrashort pulses,\" explains David Nabben, doctoral student and first author of the study.\nAnother laser wave creates the interaction with the sample object. The ultrashort electron pulses are then used to measure the object's response to the laser light, frozen in time like in a stroboscope.

What is more, the scientists not only investigate such surface phenomena, but also film the electromagnetic processes inside a waveguide material.\nThe results are highly interesting for further developments in nanophotonics, but also demonstrate the very broad application range of the new attosecond electron microscopy. \"The direct measurement of the electromagnetic functionality of materials as a function of space and time is not only of great value for fundamental science, but also opens up the way for new developments in photonic integrated circuits or metamaterials,\" Nabben says.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPeter Baum, Attosecond electron microscopy of sub-cycle optical dynamics, Nature (2023).

   "text": "A team of scientists from Ohio University, Argonne National Laboratory, the University of Illinois-Chicago, and others, led by Ohio University Professor of Physics, and Argonne National Laboratory scientist, Saw Wai Hla, have taken the world's first X-ray SIGNAL (or SIGNATURE) of just one atom. This groundbreaking achievement could revolutionize the way scientists detect the materials.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince its discovery by Roentgen in 1895, X-rays have been used everywhere, from medical examinations to security screenings in airports. Even Curiosity, NASA's Mars rover, is equipped with an X-ray device to examine the materials composition of the rocks in Mars. An important usage of X-rays in science is to identify the type of materials in a sample. Over the years, the quantity of materials in a sample required for X-ray detection has been greatly reduced thanks to the development of synchrotron X-rays sources and new instruments. To date, the smallest amount one can X-ray a sample is in attogram, that is about 10,000 atoms or more. This is due to the X-ray signal produced by an atom being extremely weak so that the conventional X-ray detectors cannot be used to detect it. According to Hla, it is a long-standing dream of scientists to X-ray just one atom, which is now being realized by the research team led by him.\n\"Atoms can be routinely imaged with scanning probe microscopes, but without X-rays one cannot tell what they are made of. We can now detect exactly the type of a particular atom, one atom-at-a-time,  and can simultaneously measure its chemical state,\" explained Hla, who is also the director of the Nanoscale and Quantum Phenomena Institute at Ohio University. \"Once we are able to do that, we can trace the materials down to ultimate limit of just one atom. This will have a great impact on environmental and medical sciences and maybe even find a cure that can have a huge impact for humankind. This discovery will transform the world.\"\nTheir paper, published in the scientific journal Nature on May 31, 2023, and gracing the cover of the print version of the scientific journal on June 1, 2023, details how Hla and several other physicists and chemists, including Ph.D. students at OHIO, used a purpose-built synchrotron X-ray instrument at the XTIP beamline of Advanced Photon Source and the Center for Nanoscale Materials at Argonne National Laboratory.\nFor demonstration, the team chose an iron atom and a terbium atom, both inserted in respective molecular hosts. To detect X-ray signal of one atom, the research team supplemented conventional detectors in X-rays with a specialized detector made of a sharp metal tip positioned at extreme proximity to the sample to collect X-ray excited electrons\u2014a technique known as synchrotron X-ray scanning tunneling microscopy or SX-STM. X-ray spectroscopy in SX-STM is triggered by photoabsorption of core level electrons, which constitutes elemental fingerprints and is effective in identifying the elemental type of the materials directly.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Hla, the spectrums are like fingerprints, each one being unique and able to detect exactly what it is.\n\"The technique used, and concept proven in this study, broke new ground in X-ray science and nanoscale studies,\" said Tolulope Michael Ajayi, who is the first author of the paper and doing this work as part of his Ph.D. thesis. \"More so, using X-rays to detect and characterize individual atoms could revolutionize research and give birth to new technologies in areas such as quantum information and the detection of trace elements in environmental and medical research, to name a few. This achievement also opens the road for advanced materials science instrumentation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                (Left) An image of a ring shaped supramolecule where only one Fe atom is present in the entire ring. (Right) X-ray signature of just one Fe atom. Credit: Saw-Wai Hla\n             \n\n\nFor the last 12 years, Hla has been involved in the development of an SX-STM instrument and its measurement methods together with Volker Rose, a scientist at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory.\n\"I have been able to successfully supervise four OHIO graduate students for their Ph.D. theses related to SX-STM method development over a 12-year period. We have come a long way to achieve the detection of a single atom X-ray signature,\" Hla said.\nHla's study is focused on nano and quantum sciences with a particular emphasis on understanding materials' chemical and physical properties at the fundamental level\u2014on an individual atom basis. In addition to achieving X-ray signature of one atom, the team's key goal was to use this technique to investigate the environmental effect on a single rare-earth atom.\n\"We have detected the chemical states of individual atoms as well,\" Hla explained. \"By comparing the chemical states of an iron atom and a terbium atom inside respective molecular hosts, we find that the terbium atom, a rare-earth metal, is rather isolated and does not change its chemical state while the iron atom strongly interacts with its surrounding.\"\nMany rare-earth materials are used in everyday devices, such as cell phones, computers and televisions, to name a few, and are extremely important in creating and advancing technology. Through this discovery, scientists can now identify not only the type of element but its chemical state as well, which will allow them to better manipulate the atoms inside different materials hosts to meet the ever-changing needs in various fields. Moreover, they have also developed a new method called \"X-ray excited resonance tunneling or X-ERT\" that allows them to detect how orbitals of a single molecule orient on a material surface using synchrotron X-rays.\n\"This achievement connects synchrotron X-rays with quantum tunneling process to detect X-ray signature of an individual atom and opens many exciting research directions including the research on quantum and spin (magnetic) properties of just one atom using synchrotron X-rays,\" Hla said.\nIn addition to Ajayi, several other OHIO graduate students including current Ph.D. students Sineth Premarathna in Physics and Xinyue Cheng in Chemistry, as well as Ph.D. in Physics alumni Sanjoy Sarkar, Shaoze Wang, Kyaw Zin Latt, Tomas Rojas, and Anh T. Ngo, currently an Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of Illinois-Chicago, were involved in this research.

Their work was published in Physical Review Applied.\nQuantum state manipulation is widely applied in quantum system like superconducting qubits and semiconductor quantum dots. A quantum system with simple energy levels is easy to manipulate, but interferences may occur in a more complicated multilevel system. For example, a two-qubit semiconductor spin system has a theoretical model of five energy levels.\nWhen driving such a system, different coherent processes within the system interfere with each other, making it difficult to analyze and control the evolution process. Currently, related research is mostly limited to various approximate conditions, which are unfavorable for further development of qubit manipulation.\nIn order to study the effects of driving fields on multilevel systems, previous work has often relied on numerical simulations or reduced multi-level systems to two-level systems. However, these methods cannot comprehensively describe the complex phenomena in the experiments. Therefore, finding a suitable reference frame (or basis vector) can greatly simplify the problem.\nIn this work, researchers coupled a shuttle state with all the other energy levels and achieved equivalent coupling between any two energy levels by tuning the amplitude and frequency of the shuttle state. This is possible because the effective model of their Floquet engineering can achieve any desired equivalent model by tuning these parameters.\nThe results show that within the experimental parameter range, this approach can implement a wide range of couplings while maintaining high control speed. Using this method, the researchers theoretically demonstrated single-qubit and two-qubit gate operations with fidelities exceeding 99%. This model can even interpret some previously unexplained novel odd-even effects observed in experiments.\nIn this scheme, the shuttle state plays a crucial role. It not only enables effective coupling between any two energy levels but also serves as a means of measurement. Researchers can conduct non-destructive measurements of quantum states by measuring the shuttle state.\nThis theoretical proposal has significant applications, as the multi-energy level systems discussed in this study are found in almost all other physical systems, including atoms, ions, and superconducting qubits.\nBy making appropriate improvements to the scheme and selecting suitable parameters, arbitrary gate control can be realized in other models. This new scheme provided fresh experimental insights for quantum gate operations in multi-level systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYuan Zhou et al, Full Tunability and Quantum Coherent Dynamics of a Driven Multilevel System, Physical Review Applied (2023).

   "text": "Vortices of light, null regions of intensity surrounded by spiral phases, make up the skeleton of a wavefield and influence the properties of light. Since the discovery of the tight connection of optical vortices and orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light in the seminal paper in 1992, considerable research progress has been made to unveil the beauty of vortices of light.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerous applications of optical OAM have been discovered in both classic and quantum optics, including optical communication, quantum entanglement and cryptography, optical tweezing, driving torque for a micromachine, rotational Doppler shift, and imaging.\nIn a new paper published in eLight, a team of scientists led by Professor Qiwen Zhan from the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology examined the latest developments of spatiotemporal vortices of light.\nOptical vortices feature azimuthal phase dependence. The OAM carried by each photon is proportional to the topological charge and quantized. The spin angular momentum (SAM), associated with circular polarization states, is limited, but the OAM per photon is theoretically unbounded. The direction of angular momentum of light is usually directed along the propagation direction.\nA decade ago, the interest in transverse SAM emerged and transversely spinning electric fields was discovered in strongly focused beams and evanescent waves. The word \"photonic wheel\" describes the orthogonal relationship between the SAM direction and the propagation direction. Analogously, optical vortices carrying transverse OAM have attracted rapidly growing interest.\nTilted vortices of light were predicted using the special theory of relativity. A transversely moving observer sees a spatial optical vortex near the speed of light as a tilted vortex. Spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs), occupying a small fraction of total energy, were first observed in femtosecond filaments in the air.\nLater, controllable generation of STOVs with transverse OAM was demonstrated using linear optics. The second harmonic generation (SHG) of transverse OAM was reported, and the conservation of OAM demonstrated. Rigorous calculation of transverse OAM and the coupling of transverse OAM and SAM were also accomplished.\nSchemes were designed to generate STOVs using metasurfaces and photonic crystals. Undoubtedly, the experimental realization of STOVs has been driving the increasing interest in STOVs and spurring their potential applications in various optical phenomena. It should be noted that this article focuses on the very recent advances related to STOVs. Readers interested in the latest developments of more general spatiotemporal wave packets and structured waves may refer to several review articles cited in this work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChenhao Wan et al, Optical spatiotemporal vortices, eLight (2023).

An atom consists of a nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by a cloud of electrons.\nFree the neutrons\nNow for something high school chemistry might not have taught us: the humble neutron, found in the nucleus of every atom but hydrogen, can\u2014if manipulated in just the right way\u2014shed light on everything from the climate crisis and energy, to health and quantum computing.\nOne such way is a rather spectacular process known as spallation, high-energy particles destabilize an atom's nucleus, which in turn releases some of the neutrons found there.\nWhen harnessed, these newly freed neutrons can be used like X-rays to map the inner structure of materials.\nCurrently under construction in Lund, Sweden, the European Spallation Source (ESS) is expected to come online in 2027. Once it achieves its full specifications, its unprecedented flux and spectral range is set to make it the most powerful and versatile neutron source for science in the world.\nThe purpose of the facility, said Jimmy Binderup Andersen, head of innovation and industry at the ESS, \"is to create neutrons, a neutron beam, to be used for scientific purposes.\"\nOnce the facility is up and running, scientists from across Europe and the rest of the world will be able to use its 15 different beamlines to conduct fundamental research.\nNot X-ray\nAccording to Andersen, a neutron beam \"is not the same as an X-ray, but it is complementary and uses some of the same physical laws.\"\nLike X-rays, neutrons can be used to probe materials and biological systems. But they interact with materials in different ways to the photons in high-energy X-ray beams, and therefore provide different types of information about their targets.\nFor example, neutron beams can say something about the interior dynamics of lithium-ion batteries, reveal obscured details from ancient artifacts or clarify the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. They can also be used to explore fundamental physics. It almost seems like a case of \"what can't they do?\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nNeutron bombardments\nAs part of the BrightnESS-2 project partly coordinated by Andersen, technologies developed for the ESS were shared with industry in Europe, to benefit society at large. For instance, some of the power systems developed for the ESS beamlines could be useful for renewable energy technologies, like wind turbines.\nRecently, the ESS was contacted by a European semiconductor manufacturer interested in the radiation fields the neutron source can generate. The world we live in is constantly bombarded with neutrons, produced when high-energy particles from outer space, such as cosmic rays from the sun, collide with Earth's atmosphere. Over time, this exposure can damage electrical components.\nThe ESS can mimic this neutron bombardment, but on a much faster time scale, enabling it to be used to test the durability of critical electrical components, such as those used in airplanes, wind turbines and spacecraft.\nNow ESS is teaming up with other research institutes and companies to find a possible future use of a facility like ESS to address such specific industry needs.\nESS 2.0\nAlthough the ESS is still being built, scientists are already working on an upgrade to the facility.\nWhen the ESS first opens it will have one moderator, but the HighNESS project is developing a second moderator system. The moderators will slow down the neutrons generated during the spallation process, to an energy level that the scientific instruments can use.\n\"The neutron energy really matters in a neutron facility, because depending on the neutron energy, you can do different kinds of physics,\" said Valentina Santoro, coordinator of the HighNESS project.\nWhile the first moderator will provide high-brightness, which is a very focused beam of neutrons, the source being developed by the HighNESS project will deliver a high intensity, in other words, a large number of neutrons.\nThe two moderators will allow scientists to explore different aspects of the dynamics and structure of materials such as polymers, biomolecules, liquid metals and batteries.\nA fundamental mystery\nThe second moderator will also enable explorations of fundamental physics to try and see a neutron become an antineutron for the first time.\n\"This is very interesting, because you observe a phenomenon where matter becomes antimatter,\" said Santoro, who is a particle physicist based at the ESS. \"If you observe something like that you can understand one of the biggest unsolved mysteries: Why there is more matter than antimatter in the universe.\"\nThis experiment can only be done at ESS, Santoro said, because it requires a huge number of neutrons and the ESS will have the highest number in the world.\n\"You just need one neutron that becomes an antineutron, and that is it, you've found this process where matter becomes antimatter,\" Santoro said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n BrightnESS-2  HighNESS  Research infrastructures \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHorizon: The EU Research & Innovation Magazine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow the humble neutron can help solve some of the universe's deepest mysteries (2023, May 30)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tretrieved 15 June 2023\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom https://phys.org/news/2023-05-humble-neutron-universe-deepest-mysteries.html\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This document is subject to copyright.

   "text": "Atoms in a crystal form a regular lattice, in which they can move over small distances from their equilibrium positions. Such phonon excitations are represented by quantum states. A superposition of phonon states defines a so-called phonon wavepacket, which is connected with collective coherent oscillations of the atoms in the crystal.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoherent phonons can be generated by excitation of the crystal with a femtosecond light pulse, and their motions in space and time can be followed by scattering an ultrashort X-ray pulse from the excited material. The pattern of scattered X-rays gives direct insight to the momentary position of and distances between the atoms. A sequence of such patterns provides a \"movie\" of the atomic motions.\nThe physical properties of coherent phonons are determined by the symmetry of the crystal, which represents a periodic arrangement of identical unit cells. Weak optical excitation does not change the symmetry properties of the crystal. In this case, coherent phonons with identical atomic motions in all unit cells are excited. In contrast, strong optical excitation can break the symmetry of the crystal and make atoms in adjacent unit cells oscillate differently.\nWhile this mechanism holds potential for accessing other phonons, it has not been explored so far.\nIn the journal Physical Review B, researchers from the Max-Born-Institute in Berlin, in collaboration with researchers from the University of Duisburg-Essen, have demonstrated a novel concept for exciting and probing coherent phonons in crystals of a transiently broken symmetry. The key of this concept lies in reducing the symmetry of a crystal by appropriate optical excitation, as has been shown with the prototypical crystalline semimetal bismuth (Bi).\n\n\n\n\n\n                (a) Coherent phonon oscillations with a frequency of 2.6 THz observed in optical pump/femtosecond x-ray diffraction probe experiments for different pump fluences of the mid-infrared excitation pulses centered at a wavelength of 5 \u00b5m. The phonon wave packets are exclusively observed for strong excitation pulses, i.e., they are absent for pump fluences below 1.9 mJ/cm2. Thus, the reduction of the symmetry of the unit cell via strong optical pumping is necessary to get access to the phonon motion. (b) Spectrum of the phonon oscillation gained by a Fourier transform of the transient at a fluence of 2.9 mJ/cm2 shown in panel (a). Credit: MBI/M. Runge\n             \n\n\nUltrafast mid-infrared excitation of electrons in Bi modifies the spatial charge distribution, and thus, reduces the crystal symmetry transiently. In the reduced symmetry, new quantum pathways for the excitation of coherent phonons open up. The symmetry reduction causes a doubling of the unit-cell size from the red framework with two Bi atoms to the blue framework with four Bi atoms. In addition to the unidirectional atomic motion, the unit cell with four Bi atoms allows for coherent phonon wave packets with bidirectional atomic motions.\nProbing the transient crystal structure directly by femtosecond X-ray diffraction reveals oscillations of diffracted intensity, which persist on a picosecond time scale. The oscillations arise from coherent wave packet motions along phonon coordinates in the crystal of reduced symmetry.\nTheir frequency of 2.6 THz is different from that of phonon oscillations at low excitation level. Interestingly, this behavior occurs only above a threshold of the optical pump fluence and reflects the highly non-linear, so-called non-perturbative character of the optical excitation process.\nIn summary, optically induced symmetry breaking allows for modifying the excitation spectrum of a crystal on ultrashort time scales. These results may pave the way for steering material properties transiently, and thus, implementing new functions in optoacoustics and optical switching.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAzize Ko\u00e7 et al, Quantum pathways of carrier and coherent phonon excitation in bismuth, Physical Review B (2023).

This method, which is also used for airport baggage scanning, can generate images of the material at nanometre resolution.\nUsing high energy X-rays that are intensely focused through a set of novel diffractive lenses, the special technique allows imaging to be performed at less than 1% of the X-ray damage threshold of the specimen. The results, which reveal this method as a promising tool for brighter next-generation light sources such as the planned upgrade project PETRA IV, have been published in the journal Light: Science & Applications.\nX-ray light interacts with biological material in a variety of ways, mostly depending on the energy and intensity of the light. At the same time, radiation damage, such as small structural changes up to complete degradation of the sample, is the limiting factor during X-ray imaging of biological samples.\nAt low energies, the X-rays are primarily absorbed by the atoms in the sample, whose electrons take on the energy, causing them to spring out of the atoms and cause damage to the sample. Images using these low-energy X-rays thus map out the sample's absorption of the radiation. At higher energies, absorption is less likely, and a process called elastic scattering occurs, where the X-ray photons \"bounce\" off of the matter like billiard balls without depositing their energy.\nTechniques such as crystallography or ptychography use this interaction. Nevertheless, absorption can still occur, meaning damage to the sample happens anyway. But there is a third interaction: Compton scattering, where the X-rays leave only a tiny amount of their energy in the target material. Compton scattering had been largely ignored as a viable method of X-ray microscopy, since it requires even higher X-ray energies where until now no suitable high-resolution lenses existed.\n\"We used Compton scattering and we figured out that the amount of energy deposited into a sample per number of photons that you can detect is lower than using these other methods,\" says Chapman, who is a leading scientist at DESY, a professor at Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, and inventor of different X-ray techniques at synchrotrons and free-electron lasers.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe advantage of low dose in the sample posed a challenge for making suitable lenses. High-energy X-rays pass through all materials and are hardly refracted, or bent, as needed for focusing. Bajt, who is a group leader at CFEL, led efforts to develop a new kind of refractive lens, called multilayer Laue lenses. These new optics comprise over 7300 nanometer-thin alternating layers of silicon carbide and tungsten carbide that the team used to construct a holographic optical element that was thick enough to efficiently focus the X-ray beam.\nUsing this lens system and the PETRA III beamline P07 at DESY, the team imaged a variety of biological materials by detecting Compton scattering data as the sample was passed through the focused beam. This mode of scanning microscopy requires a very bright source\u2014the brighter, the better\u2014which is focused to a spot that defines the image resolution.\nPETRA III is one of the synchrotron radiation facilities worldwide which is bright enough at high X-ray energies to be able to acquire images this way in a reasonable time. The technique could reach its full potential with the planned PETRA IV facility.\nTo test the method, the team used a cyanobacterium, a diatom, and even a pollen grain collected directly outside the lab (\"a very local specimen,\" Bajt laughs) as their samples, and achieved a resolution of 70 nanometers for each.\nMoreover, when compared with images obtained from a similar pollen sample using a conventional coherent-scattering imaging method at an energy of 17 keV, Compton X-ray microscopy achieved a similar resolution with 2000 times lower X-ray dose. \"When we re-examined the specimens using a light microscope after the experiment, we could not see any trace of where the beam had come in contact with them,\" she explains\u2014meaning no radiation damage was left behind.\n\"These results could even be better,\" Chapman says. \"Ideally, an experiment like this would use a spherical detector, because the X-rays coming out of the sample go in every direction from the sample. In that way, it's a bit like a particle physics collision experiment, where you need to collect data in all directions.\"\nAdditionally, Chapman pointed out that the image of the cyanobacteria is relatively featureless as compared to the others. However, the data indicate that at a higher brightness, such as that of the planned PETRA IV upgrade, individual organelles and even structures in three dimensions would become visible\u2014up to a resolution of 10 nm without damage being a problem. \"Really, the only limitation of this technique was not the nature of the technique itself but rather the source, namely its brightness,\" says Bajt.\nWith a brighter source, the method could then be used for imaging whole unsectioned cells or tissue, complementing cryo-electron microscopy and super-resolution optical microscopy, or for tracking nanoparticles within a cell, such as for directly observing drug delivery. The characteristics of Compton scattering makes this method ideal for non-biological uses as well, such as examining the mechanics of battery charging and discharging.\n\"There hasn't been anything like this technique in the literature yet,\" says Bajt, \"so there is much to explore going forward.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTang Li et al, Dose-efficient scanning Compton X-ray microscopy, Light: Science & Applications (2023).

   "text": "Multi-wavelength femtosecond pulses with flexible tunability in both the temporal and spectral domains have been widely desired, owing to their potential applications in controlling strong field ionization, electron dynamics, and high-order harmonic generation. Particularly, ultrafast pulses coherently synthesized by multiple spectral bands are thought to be an ingenious instrument to harness or enhance high-harmonic generation(HHG).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the aforementioned applications in strong-field physics, mid-infrared (MIR) lasers attract substantial research efforts, as the ponderomotive force scales quadratically with the driving wavelength. Therefore, MIR multi-wavelength-shaped pulses are in high demand. However, the existing methods for generating multi-wavelength pulses lack freedom in spectral tuning and require sophisticated apparatus for complicated phase and noise control.\nRecently, researcher Houkun Liang, of Sichuan University's College of Electronics and Information Engineering, and his team proposed a relatively simple and compact method to generate MIR pulses with dual-wavelength spectral shaping and exceptional freedom of tunability in both the lasing wavelength and relative spectral amplitudes by combing Martinez compressor and optical parametric amplifier based on LGS crystal. Their paper is published in the journal Ultrafast Science.\nThe output MIR spectra exhibit two tunable means:\nWhen the dispersion is completely compensated, different dual-wavelength pairs at 5.6, 10 \u03bcm; 6.0, 9.6 \u03bcm; 6.6, 9.0 \u03bcm; 7.1, 8.4 \u03bcm; and 8.2 \u03bcm with a maximal average power up to 280 mW and a power efficiency of 2.8% at the repetition rate of 50 kHz by adjusting the phase match angle; When the dispersion is partly compensated, the relative spectral amplitudes of a specific dual-wavelength pair can be arbitrarily changed by controlling the pump delay.\nTo test the usefulness of the demonstrated high-power MIR light source with dual-wavelength spectra shaping features, HHG is driven by MIR dual-wavelength tunable pulses in a 3-mm-thick polycrystalline ZnSe plate. Thanks to the dual-wavelength tunability, the acquired HHG spectra have traits of spectral shaping of HHG with multiple groups of harmonics in both the spectral position and relative strengths.\nMIR ultra-short pulses with outstanding freedom in multi-wavelength spectral shaping can trigger more advanced applications such as enhancement of HHG, THz wave generation, tunable intra-pulse difference-frequency generation, attosecond metrology, and controlling electron localization in molecular dissociation. Moreover, the demonstrated HHG steering method could open new possibilities in exploring femtosecond control of electron dynamics and light-matter interaction in composite molecular systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLinzhen He et al, Dual-Wavelength Spectrum-Shaped Mid-Infrared Pulses and Steering High-Harmonic Generation in Solids, Ultrafast Science (2023).

On the other hand, filament-induced breakdown spectroscopy is restricted by peak power constraints, rendering sensitivity difficult to improve. To surmount these obstacles, the research team first developed the technique of plasma gratings-induced breakdown spectroscopy.\nUtilizing two non-collinearly coupled filament pulses, this method forms a plasma grating to surmount the peak power restrictions and enhance the electronic density of the excitation, enabling a quantum leap in sensitivity and overcoming interference from the plasma shielding effect.\nTo further enhance the excitation effect, the research team went on to propose the technique of multidimensional plasma grating-induced breakdown spectroscopy. This method utilizes three non-collinear and non-coplanar femtosecond pulses that interact with the sample to generate plasma grating. The team successfully observed the diffraction effect of the plasma grating, achieving a progression from one-dimension to two-dimension.\nThe periodic structure and higher-order nonlinear effects of the two-dimensional plasma grating greatly enhanced the plasma density and power density, elevating the sensitivity of the breakdown spectroscopy detection technique to an even higher level. The research team also discovered that the spectral line signal obtained by MIBS technology is enhanced with the increase of laser energy, reaching more significant advantages when the single-pulse energy exceeds 2 mJ.\nMoreover, MIBS technology only requires modifications on the excitation source without introducing complex sample preparation steps or additional equipment, retaining the fast, simple, and convenient advantages of LIBS technology, making it capable of meeting the in-situ, real-time detection needs in specific scenarios.\nBuilding on the outstanding results achieved by multi-beam pulse laser coupling, a novel combination of filament-induced breakdown spectroscopy and plasma grating-induced breakdown spectroscopy (F-GIBS) was proposed specifically for solution detection.\nBy reasonably setting the impact delay between the filament and plasma grating, a dual excitation effect for solution detection was achieved, overcoming the issues of bubbles and splashing encountered by breakdown spectroscopy in solution detection, and improving the sensitivity and accuracy of solution detection.\nWith the development and application of GIBS/MIBS/F-GIBS technologies, it has become possible to adapt to mobile operations in harsh field conditions and achieve non-contact online in-situ detection. These technologies are expected to find extensive applications in fields such as mineral exploration, environmental monitoring, water science, and life sciences.\nThe findings are published in the journal Ultrafast Science.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMengyun Hu et al, Breakdown Spectroscopy Induced by Nonlinear Interactions of Femtosecond Laser Filaments and Multidimensional Plasma Gratings, Ultrafast Science (2023).

To achieve these results, the researchers used an approach similar to past \"supershots\" that produced more than 10 million watts of fusion power in the TFTR tokamak in the 1990s.\nThis effort demonstrated fusion-relevant ion temperatures in a compact, high magnetic field, spherical tokamak for the first time. This confirms that the spherical tokamak can achieve one of the conditions necessary for commercial fusion energy production. These results also show that similar fusion pilot plants may lead to more compact, and potentially more economical, fusion power sources than other configurations.\nPrinceton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and Tokamak Energy Ltd researchers worked within a first-of-the-kind Collaborative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) joint framework to develop operational scenarios and analysis methods. Their experiments have now demonstrated the achievement of fusion-relevant high ion temperatures in a privately built experimental fusion facility. PPPL and ORNL researchers have actively participated in the ST40 device's operation and data analysis to achieve these plasma temperatures required for commercial fusion energy.\nIn the research, ST40 plasmas operated at toroidal magnetic field values of just over 2 Tesla and were heated by 1.8 million watts of high energy neutral particles. While the ST40 plasma discharges lasted for only 150 milliseconds, the plasma showed ion temperatures of more than 100 million degrees Celsius.\nThe researchers used the TRANSP transport code developed at PPPL to determine the ion temperature of the main species deuterium based on the ranges of impurity temperature profiles that were measured.

They used a deep neural network-based algorithm to customize the antenna-like structures within their metasurface. By iteratively reducing inconsistencies between the original and holographic image, they tweaked the metasurface and created a high-quality hologram.\n\"We chose to recreate the Mona Lisa as a proof of concept,\" said Wang. \"It is so famous that almost everyone knows about it.

By varying the external temperature, the focal length of the CVBAM can be dynamically tuned from 736.25 \u03bcm to 861.02 \u03bcm, while the achromatic focusing can be maintained, as well.\nThe proposed metalens can significantly enrich the capabilities and potential applications of current meta-devices, which may facilitate the development of THz near-field imaging and spectroscopy systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tXiao-Qiang Jiang et al, Continuously varifocal metalens for broadband achromatic focusing of terahertz waves, Journal of Science: Advanced Materials and Devices (2023).

   "text": "When Thomas Hertog was first summoned to Stephen Hawking's office in the late 1990s, there was an instant connection between the young Belgian researcher and the legendary British theoretical physicist.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Something clicked between us,\" Hertog said.\nThat connection would continue even as Hawking's debilitating disease ALS robbed him of his last ways to communicate, allowing the pair to complete a new theory that aims to turn how science looks at the universe on its head.\nThe theory, which would be Hawking's last before his death in 2018, has been laid out in full for the first time in Hertog's book \"On the Origin of Time\", published in the UK last month.\nIn an interview with AFP, the cosmologist spoke about their 20-year collaboration, how they communicated via facial expression, and why Hawking ultimately decided his landmark book \"A Brief of History of Time\" was written from the wrong perspective.\nThe 'designed' universe\nDuring their first meeting at Cambridge University in 1998, Hawking wasted no time in bringing up the problem bothering him.\n\"The universe we observe appears designed,\" Hawking told Hertog, communicating via a clicker connected to a speech machine.\nHertog explained that \"the laws of physics\u2014the rules on which the universe runs\u2014turn out to be just perfect for the universe to be habitable, for life to be possible.\"\nThis remarkable string of good luck stretches from the delicate balance that makes it possible for atoms to form molecules necessary for chemistry to the expansion of the universe itself, which allows for vast cosmic structures such as galaxies.\nOne \"trendy\" answer to this problem has been the multiverse, an idea that has recently become popular in the movie industry, Hertog said.\nThis theory explains away the seemingly designed nature of the universe by making it just one of countless others\u2014most of which are \"crap, lifeless, sterile\", the 47-year-old added.\nBut Hawking realized the \"great mire of paradoxes the multiverse was leading us into\", arguing there must be a better explanation, Hertog said.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nOutsider's perspective\nA few years into their collaboration, \"it began to sink in\" that they were missing something fundamental, Hertog said.\nThe multiverse and even \"A Brief History of Time\" were \"attempts to describe the creation and evolution of our universe from what Stephen would call a 'God's eye perspective',\" Hertog said.\nBut because \"we are within the universe\" and not outside looking in, our theories cannot be decoupled from our perspective, he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Hawking had \"a very wide range of facial expressions, ranging from extreme disagreement to extreme excitement\", Hertog said.\n             \n\n\n\"That was why (Hawking) said that 'A Brief History of Time' is written from the wrong perspective.\"\nFor the next 15 years, the pair used the oddities of quantum theory to develop a new theory of physics and cosmology from an \"observer's perspective\".\nBut by 2008, Hawking had lost the ability to use his clicker, becoming increasingly isolated from the world.\n\"I thought it was over,\" Hertog said.\nThen the pair developed a \"somewhat magical\" level of non-verbal communication that allowed them to continue working, he said.\nPositioned in front of Hawking, Hertog would ask questions and look into the physicist's eyes.\n\"He had a very wide range of facial expressions, ranging from extreme disagreement to extreme excitement,\" he said.\n\"It's impossible to disentangle\" which parts of the final theory came from himself or Hawking, Hertog said, adding that many of the ideas had been developed between the pair over the years.\n'One grand evolutionary process'\nTheir theory is focused on what happened in the first moments after the Big Bang.\nRather than an explosion that followed a pre-existing set of rules, they propose that the laws of physics evolved along with the universe.\nThis means that if you turn back the clock far enough, \"the laws of physics themselves begin to simplify and disappear\", Hertog said.\n\"Ultimately, even the dimension of time evaporates.\"\nUnder this theory, the laws of physics and time itself evolved in a way that resembles biological evolution\u2014the title of Hertog's book is a reference to Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\".\n\"What we're essentially saying is that (biology and physics) are two levels of one grand evolutionary process,\" Hertog said.\nHe acknowledged that it is difficult to prove this theory because the first years of the universe remain \"hidden in the mist of the Big Bang\".\nOne way to lift this veil could be by studying gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of space time, while another could be via quantum holograms constructed on quantum computers, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t

   "text": "Artificial intelligence algorithms are quickly becoming a part of everyday life. Many systems that require strong security are either already underpinned by machine learning or soon will be. These systems include facial recognition, banking, military targeting applications, and robots and autonomous vehicles, to name a few.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis raises an important question: how secure are these machine learning algorithms against malicious attacks?\nIn an article published today in Nature Machine Intelligence, my colleagues at the University of Melbourne and I discuss a potential solution to the vulnerability of machine learning models.\nWe propose that the integration of quantum computing in these models could yield new algorithms with strong resilience against adversarial attacks.\nThe dangers of data manipulation attacks\nMachine learning algorithms can be remarkably accurate and efficient for many tasks. They are particularly useful for classifying and identifying image features. However, they're also highly vulnerable to data manipulation attacks, which can pose serious security risks.\nData manipulation attacks\u2014which involve the very subtle manipulation of image data\u2014can be launched in several ways. An attack may be launched by mixing corrupt data into a training dataset used to train an algorithm, leading it to learn things it shouldn't.\nManipulated data can also be injected during the testing phase (after training is complete), in cases where the AI system continues to train the underlying algorithms while in use.\nPeople can even carry out such attacks from the physical world. Someone could put a sticker on a stop sign to fool a self-driving car's AI into identifying it as a speed-limit sign. Or, on the front lines, troops might wear uniforms that can fool AI-based drones into identifying them as landscape features.\nEither way, the consequences of data manipulation attacks can be severe. For example, if a self-driving car uses a machine learning algorithm that has been compromised, it may incorrectly predict there are no humans on the road\u2014when there are.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nHow quantum computing can help\nIn our article, we describe how integrating quantum computing with machine learning could give rise to secure algorithms called quantum machine learning models.\nThese algorithms are carefully designed to exploit special quantum properties that would allow them to find specific patterns in image data that aren't easily manipulated. The result would be resilient algorithms that are safe against even powerful attacks. They also wouldn't require the expensive \"adversarial training\" currently used to teach algorithms how to resist such attacks.\nBeyond this, quantum machine learning could allow for faster algorithmic training and more accuracy in learning features.\nSo how would it work?\nToday's classical computers work by storing and processing information as \"bits\", or binary digits, the smallest unit of data a computer can process. In classical computers, which follow the laws of classical physics, bits are represented as binary numbers\u2014specifically 0s and 1s.\nQuantum computing, on the other hand, follows principles used in quantum physics. Information in quantum computers is stored and processed as qubits (quantum bits) which can exist as 0, 1, or a combination of both at once. A quantum system that exists in multiple states at once is said to be in a superposition state. Quantum computers can be used to design clever algorithms that exploit this property.\nHowever, while there are significant potential benefits in using quantum computing to secure machine learning models, it could also be a double-edged sword.\nOn one hand, quantum machine learning models will provide critical security for many sensitive applications. On the other, quantum computers could be used to generate powerful adversarial attacks, capable of easily deceiving even state-of-the-art conventional machine learning models.\nMoving forward, we'll need to seriously consider the best ways to protect our systems; an adversary with access to early quantum computers would pose a significant security threat.\nLimitations to overcome\nThe current evidence suggests we're still some years away from quantum machine learning becoming a reality, due to limitations in the current generation of quantum processors.\nToday's quantum computers are relatively small (with fewer than 500 qubits) and their error rates are high. Errors may arise for several reasons, including imperfect fabrication of qubits, errors in the control circuitry, or loss of information (called \"quantum decoherence\") through interaction with the environment.\nStill, we've seen enormous progress in quantum hardware and software over the past few years. According to recent quantum hardware roadmaps, it's anticipated quantum devices made in coming years will have hundreds to thousands of qubits.\nThese devices should be able to run powerful quantum machine learning models to help protect a large range of industries that rely on machine learning and AI tools.\nWorldwide, governments and private sectors alike are increasing their investment in quantum technologies.\nThis month the Australian government launched the National Quantum Strategy, aimed at growing the nation's quantum industry and commercializing quantum technologies. According to the CSIRO, Australia's quantum industry could be worth about A$2.2 billion by 2030.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nJournal information:\nNature Machine Intelligence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Conversation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

   "text": "The absolute internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of indium gallium nitride (InGaN) based blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) at low temperatures is often assumed to be 100%. However, a new study from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Electrical and Computer Engineering researchers has found that the assumption of always perfect IQE is wrong: the IQE of an LED can be as low as 27.5%.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis new research was recently published in Applied Physics Letters.\nAs ECE associate professor Can Bayram puts it, LEDs are the ultimate lighting source. Since their invention, they have become increasingly popular due to their energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\nAn LED is a semiconductor that emits light when current flows through the device. It generates photons through the recombination of electrons and holes (carriers), releasing energy in the form of photons. The color of the light emitted corresponds to the energy of the photon.\nInGaN-based blue LEDs enable bright and energy-saving white lighting. The transition to solid-state lighting sources has significantly reduced energy needs and greenhouse gas emissions, but continual efficiency improvements are necessary to hit energy savings goals in the long term. The U.S. Department of Energy's 2035 roadmap calls for blue LED efficiency to increase from 70% to 90% and furthering energy savings by 450 terawatt hours (TWh) and CO2 emission savings by 150 million metric tons.\nBayram says, \"The question is, how can we push this ultimate lighting source further? The answer is by understanding its absolute efficiency, not relative efficiency.\" Relative efficiency benchmarks a device with itself, while absolute efficiency allows for comparison across different devices by measuring the efficiency on a commonly shared scale.\nIQE is defined as the ratio of the generated photons to the injected electrons in the active region of the semiconductor and is an important metric to quantify the performance of LEDs. The most widely used method to quantify IQE is by temperature-dependent photoluminescence. In such analyses, it has been assumed that at low temperatures (4, 10, or even 77 Kelvin), there is 100% radiative recombination- meaning producing a photon. At room temperature, because of non-radiative mechanisms- which emit excess energy as heat, rather than photons- the efficiency is significantly lower. The ratio of the two photoluminescence intensities gives a relative efficiency of the LED.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe original assumption has been that at low temperatures, there are no non-radiative recombination- all the loss mechanisms are \"frozen\". Bayram and graduate student Yu-Chieh Chiu assert, however, that this assumption may be wrong because non-radiative effects might not in fact be completely frozen out at low temperatures.\nIn their paper, Bayram and Chiu demonstrate a different method for revealing low temperature absolute IQE of InGaN-based LEDs. Using a \"channel-based\" recombination model, they report surprising results: the absolute IQE of the LED on traditional sapphire and silicon substrates is 27.5% and 71.1%, respectively- drastically lower than the standard assumption.\nTo explain these unexpected results, Chiu says that the channel-based recombination model is one of the ways to think about what happens inside the active layer of the LED and how recombination in one channel affects another channel. A channel is a pathway that a carrier may take to recombine radiatively or nonradiatively.\n\"To determine the efficiency of the blue LED, usually only the blue emission is considered,\" Chiu says. \"But that ignores the effects of everything else happening inside the device, specifically the non-radiative and defect luminescence channels. Our approach is to get a more holistic view of the device and determine, if there is recombination in the blue channel, how is that affected by the second and third channel(s)?\"\nAs research on the LED continues to advance, it is important to know an absolute efficiency rather than a relative efficiency. Bayram stresses that \"the absolute efficiency is very important to the field so that everyone can build on each other's knowledge rather than each group improving their own efficiency. We need absolute measurements, not just relative measurements.\"\nTo meet the efficiency standards laid out by the DOE, it will be increasingly important to properly quantify the efficiency of LEDs. Even a 1% increase in efficiency will correspond to tons of carbon dioxide savings annually. Chiu says, \"By understanding the absolute efficiency, instead of the relative efficiency, that will give us a more accurate picture and allow us to improve devices further by being able to compare them to each other.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tY.

Through a new analysis published in The European Physical Journal E, Meng Su at Northwestern Polytechnical University in China, together with Benjamin Lindner at Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany, have discovered that these motions can be accurately described using four distinct mathematical patterns.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive Brownian particles can be found across a diverse array of scenarios in nature: from sub-cellular structures pulled along by biomolecular motors, to movements of entire herds of animals, which can act collaboratively to find food or evade predators more easily.\nRecently, researchers developed artificial particles that behave in strikingly similar ways to their natural counterparts\u2014presenting exciting new opportunities in medicine robotics, and many other fields of cutting-edge research. Ultimately, Su and Lindner's discoveries could lead to fascinating new insights into how these systems behave.\nThe motions of active Brownian particles are already known to depend on the friction they experience, as well as external bias forces, which skew their paths in specific directions. Using computer simulations active Brownian systems, backed up by simple calculations, Su and Lindner discovered that variations in these two parameters can force the systems into one of four possible states.\nWhen a balance emerges between biased active driving forces, and the friction experienced by a particle, it will enter a \"locked\" state\u2014confining its motion to a small region. When its driving force instead dominates over friction, the particle will move persistently in a mostly straight line: entering a \"driving\" state.\nAlternatively, the particle can switch back and forth between locked and running states, or between two different running states. When the system is subjected to random noise, the average speed of the particles will change depending on the intensity of the noise\u2014but their motions still stay in one of these four states.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMeng Su et al, Active Brownian particles in a biased periodic potential, The European Physical Journal E (2023).

   "text": "The discovery of the Higgs boson at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012 marked a significant milestone in particle physics. Since then, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations have been diligently investigating the properties of this unique particle and searching to establish the different ways in which it is produced and decays into other particles.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the Large Hadron Collider Physics (LHCP) conference this week, ATLAS and CMS report how they teamed up to find the first evidence of the rare process in which the Higgs boson decays into a Z boson, the electrically neutral carrier of the weak force, and a photon, the carrier of the electromagnetic force. This Higgs boson decay could provide indirect evidence of the existence of particles beyond those predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics.\nThe decay of the Higgs boson into a Z boson and a photon is similar to that of a decay into two photons. In these processes, the Higgs boson does not decay directly into these pairs of particles. Instead, the decays proceed via an intermediate \"loop\" of \"virtual\" particles that pop in and out of existence and cannot be directly detected. These virtual particles could include new, as yet undiscovered particles that interact with the Higgs boson.\nThe Standard Model predicts that, if the Higgs boson has a mass of around 125 billion electronvolts, approximately 0.15% of Higgs bosons will decay into a Z boson and a photon. But some theories that extend the Standard Model predict a different decay rate. Measuring the decay rate therefore provides valuable insights into both physics beyond the Standard Model and the nature of the Higgs boson.\nPreviously, using data from proton\u2013proton collisions at the LHC, ATLAS and CMS independently conducted extensive searches for the decay of the Higgs boson into a Z boson and a photon. Both searches used similar strategies, identifying the Z boson through its decays into pairs of electrons or muons\u2014heavier versions of electrons. These Z boson decays occur in about 6.6% of the cases.\nIn these searches, collision events associated with this Higgs boson decay (the signal) would be identified as a narrow peak, over a smooth background of events, in the distribution of the combined mass of the decay products. To enhance the sensitivity to the decay, ATLAS and CMS exploited the most frequent modes in which the Higgs boson is produced and categorized events based on the characteristics of these production processes. They also used advanced machine-learning techniques to further distinguish between signal and background events.\nIn a new study, ATLAS and CMS have now joined forces to maximize the outcome of their search. By combining the data sets collected by both experiments during the second run of the LHC, which took place between 2015 and 2018, the collaborations have significantly increased the statistical precision and reach of their searches.\nThis collaborative effort resulted in the first evidence of the Higgs boson decay into a Z boson and a photon. The result has a statistical significance of 3.4 standard deviations, which is below the conventional requirement of 5 standard deviations to claim an observation. The measured signal rate is 1.9 standard deviations above the Standard Model prediction.\n\"Each particle has a special relationship with the Higgs boson, making the search for rare Higgs decays a high priority,\" says ATLAS physics coordinator Pamela Ferrari. \"Through a meticulous combination of the individual results of ATLAS and CMS, we have made a step forward towards unraveling yet another riddle of the Higgs boson.\"\n\"The existence of new particles could have very significant effects on rare Higgs decay modes,\" says CMS physics coordinator Florencia Canelli. \"This study is a powerful test of the Standard Model. With the ongoing third run of the LHC and the future High-Luminosity LHC, we will be able to improve the precision of this test and probe ever rarer Higgs decays.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCERN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExperiments see first evidence of a rare Higgs boson decay (2023, May 26)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tretrieved 15 June 2023\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom https://phys.org/news/2023-05-evidence-rare-higgs-boson-decay.html\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This document is subject to copyright.

Despite their success, these methods are fundamentally limited by their requirements for strictly-paired labeling and large training datasets.\nThe demanding training data requirements result in time-consuming data acquisition, complicated experimental design, and tedious system calibration processes, making it challenging to satisfy practical application needs.\nIn a recent publication in Light: Science & Applications, Dr. Jian Zhao from the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dr. Xiaowen Hu and Dr. Axel Sch\u00fclzgen from the College of Optics and Photonics (CREOL) at the University of Central Florida, and their colleagues presented an unsupervised learning-based optical fiber imaging system.\nThis system integrates a customized Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CyleGAN), named Restore-CycleGAN, with Glass-Air Anderson Localizing Optical Fiber (GALOF). The application of Restore-CycleGAN removes the restrictions of labeled training data, yet maintains high-quality imaging recovery, while the unique physical properties of the GALOF's modes support high-fidelity and highly robust imaging processes and guarantee the successful implementation of unpaired imaging training.\nDue to the mutual promotion between the learning algorithm and optical devices, the Restore-CycleGAN-GALOF method achieves nearly artifact-free and robust transport of full-color biological images through a meter-long optical fiber using a simple one-shot training process with a small training dataset of only 1000 image pairs, without requiring paired training imaging data. The training data size is reduced by about ten times compared to previously reported supervised learning methods.\nThe Restore-CycleGAN-GALOF method demonstrated high-fidelity, full-color image transport capabilities for various biological samples, including human and frog blood cells, human eosinophils, and human stomach cancer cells, under both transmission and reflection imaging modes.\nFurthermore, this imaging process exhibited resilience against 60-degree strong mechanical fiber bending and large working distance variations of up to 6 millimeters. Remarkably, the Restore-CycleGAN-GALOF method produced high-accuracy predictions for test data that were never included in the training process, indicating strong generalization in the small data regime.\nDespite the Restore-CycleGAN-GALOF's superior performance, the system design and experimental process are relatively simple. The scientists summarized the significance of their imaging method: \"Accessing the distal end of fiber devices and collecting sufficient training data are challenging in practical applications. The unique hollow organ or biological tissue environments impose additional difficulties in robust image transport.\"\n\"Yet, our Restore-CycleGAN-GALOF method requires only a small amount of training data and eliminates the need for pairing image features. In the small data regime, this method guarantees highly robust and strong generalizable full-color imaging. As a result, it is better suited to satisfy various practical biomedical applications.\"\n\"Our techniques are expected to lay the foundation for the next-generation fiber-optic imaging system. Our future research will focus on developing practical endoscopy systems and conducting related biomedical application tests.

   "text": "Near-Infrared (NIR) vision detectors and cameras play an essential role in today's high-tech tools for imaging, sensing and display technologies. Goggle- or binocular-based NIR cameras are particularly important for night vision, as well as medical and agriculture imaging. In conventional NIR cameras, the NIR light (700\u22122500 nm) is absorbed via a photocathode, leading to the discharge of electrons, which consequently strike an integrated flat screen, viewed by the eye or by an imaging sensor.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile such devices have proven effective in the abovementioned applications, they are bulky, heavy, monochrome and limited to certain wavelength bands. The latter is a major technological limitation because photocathodes are functional only in one of the following ranges: 400\u20131000nm, 1000\u20132500nm or >2500 nm. However, Z. Zheng and colleagues, in this paper, have demonstrated a thin film capable of covering all of these frequency bands without needing to convert the light to electrons and vice-versa.\nIn this work, researchers have employed the concept of nonlinear metasurfaces. Metasurfaces are arrays of nanoscale resonators that can manipulate light properties, including the light's propagation direction, intensity, and wavelength (/color). Metasurfaces, capable of converting the wavelength of light, are known as nonlinear metasurfaces. In this paper, a nonlinear metasurface composed of a thin silicon film is exploited. The film accommodates carefully designed and fabricated nanoscale holes, i.e., membrane geometry, that strongly resonate with the incoming light. After illuminating the designed metasurface with a NIR light, it generates a new color at 1/3 of the original wavelength via a nonlinear process, so-called third harmonic generation (THG).\nBy controlling the symmetry of the array of nano-holes, the researchers have demonstrated a versatile tool for tunning the light wavelengths and intensities, which is ultimately used for NIR imaging. The image above illustrates the concept of NIR imaging for arbitrary objects. As a demonstration, the NIR light around telecommunication wavelength (1512 nm) passes through a sector star target and gets converted into the visible signal (504nm) via the metasurfaces. The images shown in 1(bii and cii) are formed on the CCD camera.\nSuch an innovative approach for NIR imaging is widely expandable to large frequency bands and multi-color processes. Worth noting that the exploited material, i.e., silicon, is being heavily used in the CMOS industry today. Therefore, mass production of silicon metasurfaces does not need heavy investments. Moreover, silicon does not absorb NIR light in wavelengths >1000 nm, so heating is not a concern. Last but not least, silicon is a centrosymmetric material. Therefore nonlinear silicon metasurfaces can be used for other third-order nonlinear interactions beyond THG.\nFor example, by using a process called four-wave mixing, one can involve several wavelengths in the NIR and visible ranges, enabling the generation of colorful images. In other words, the demonstrated platform in this paper is a building block for the next generation of thin, inexpensive, broadband, and colorful NIR cameras and detectors.\nThe work is published in the journal Opto-Electronic Advances.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tZe Zheng et al, Third-harmonic generation and imaging with resonant Si membrane metasurface, Opto-Electronic Advances (2023).

   "text": "In March 2022, Microsoft published research results about the realization of a special type of particle that might be used to make particularly robust quantum bits. Researchers at the University of Basel are now calling these results about so-called Majorana particles into doubt: through calculations they have shown that the findings can also be explained differently.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1938 a genius suddenly vanished without a trace: after buying a ferry ticket from Palermo to Naples, the young Italian physicist Ettore Majorana seemingly disappeared from the face of the earth. Just a few months earlier he had postulated a highly unusual type of particle. These particles were supposed to be their own anti-particles and carry no electric charge.\nIn the last few years, among physicists there has been a renewed interest in these mysterious particles, which bear the name of their missing inventor (whose disappearance has not been explained to this day). The particles, it turns out, might possibly be used as particularly robust quantum bits in quantum computers.\nThe biggest obstacle in the construction of such computers, which promise unbelievable computing power, is decoherence\u2014the fact, in other words, that disturbances from the environment can very quickly destroy the sensitive quantum states with which quantum computers perform calculations. If, however, one could use Majorana particles as quantum bits, that problem could solved instantly since they have a built-in immunity against decoherence because of their special properties.\nDampened expectations\nIn a study published in the journal Physical Review Letters, researchers at the University of Basel have now dampened expectations of using Majorana particles for computation in the near future. The team led by Prof. Jelena Klinovaja showed that results published by Microsoft in 2022, according to which Majorana particles had been detected in the labs of the company, may not hold water after all.\n\"The path that Microsoft is taking with their experiments is certainly the right one,\" says Richard David Hess, Ph.D. student and first author of the study, \"but our calculations suggest that the measurement data can also be explained by other effects that having nothing to do with Majorana particles.\"\nLooking for exotic particles is detective work of the highest order, and investigators have to rely on just a few clues. They look for these clues using a nanowire made of a semiconductor material, a thousand times thinner than a human hair, coupled to a superconductor. In such a system, it is suspected, electrons and holes in the semiconductor could pair up to make quasiparticles that behave like Majorana particles.\nCharacteristic anomalies\nThrough conductance measurements the experts at Microsoft had detected an anomaly that is characteristic of such Majorana states and also shown that the superconducting properties of the superconductor-nanowire-combination respond to an applied magnetic field in a way that suggests the presence of a so-called topological phase.\nIn mathematics, topology can be illustrated by looking, for instance, at a coffee cup with a handle (a \"hole\") that can theoretically be deformed into a doughnut (which also has a \"hole,\" so both are topological equal) but not into a sphere (no \"hole\"). In Majorana states, by contrast, topology is responsible for their much coveted immunity to decoherence.\n\"We have now mathematically modeled the experiments by Microsoft and tried to find out whether the measurements could have other\u2014'trivial,' in scientific jargon\u2014explanations,\" explains Henry Legg, a postdoc in Klinovaja's group. In fact, the Basel researchers came to the conclusion that both the current anomaly and the superconducting properties can be reproduced by a small amount of disorder from impurities inside the nanowire.\n\"Our results show clearly that disorder plays an important role in such experiments,\" says Jelena Klinovaja. To detect Majorana states unambiguously and also put them to use in quantum computers, one will eventually need even purer nanowires. This also means that there will be no lack of experimental challenges in the next few years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRichard Hess et al, Trivial Andreev Band Mimicking Topological Bulk Gap Reopening in the Nonlocal Conductance of Long Rashba Nanowires, Physical Review Letters (2023).

This revealed special patterns with characteristic pinch points in the spin correlations, which in principle can also be detected experimentally in a real material with neutron experiments.\n\"In previous work, however, the spins were treated like classical vectors, without taking quantum fluctuations into account,\" says Reuther.\nThis is why Reuther, together with Yasir Iqbal from the Indian Institute of Technology in Chennai, India, and his doctoral student Nils Niggemann, has now included quantum fluctuations in the calculation of this octahedral solid-state system for the first time. These are very complex numerical calculations, that in principle are able to map fractons.\n\"The result surprised us, because we actually see that quantum fluctuations do not enhance the visibility of fractons, but on the contrary, completely blur them, even at absolute zero temperature,\" says Niggemann.\nIn the next step, the three theoretical physicists want to develop a model in which quantum fluctuations can be regulated up or down. A kind of intermediate world between classical solid-state physics and the previous simulations, in which the extended quantum electrodynamic theory with its fractons can be studied in more detail.\nNo material is yet known to exhibit fractons. But if the next model gives more precise indications of what the crystal structure and magnetic interactions should be like, then experimental physicists could start designing and measuring such materials. \"I do not see an application of these findings in the next few years, but perhaps in the coming decades and then it would be the famous quantum leap, with really new properties,\" says Reuther.\nThe findings are published in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNils Niggemann et al, Quantum Effects on Unconventional Pinch Point Singularities, Physical Review Letters (2023).

   "text": "Can a computer learn from the past and anticipate what will happen next, like a human? You might not be surprised to hear that some cutting-edge AI models could achieve this feat, but what about a computer that looks a little different\u2014more like a tank of water?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor our research, now published in Europhysics Letters, we have built a small proof-of-concept computer that uses running water instead of a traditional logical circuitry processor, and forecasts future events via an approach called \"reservoir computing.\"\nIn benchmark tests, our analogue computer did well at remembering input data and forecasting future events\u2014and in some cases it even did better than a high-performance digital computer.\nSo how does it work?\nThrowing stones in the pond\nImagine two kids, Alice and Bob, playing at the edge of a pond. Bob throws big and small stones into water one at a time, seemingly at random.\nBig and small stones create water waves of different size. Alice watches the water waves created by the stones and learns to anticipate what the waves will do next\u2014and from that, she can have an idea of which stone Bob will throw next.\nReservoir computers copy the reasoning process taking place in Alice's brain. They can learn from past inputs to predict the future events.\nAlthough reservoir computers were first proposed using neural networks\u2014computer programs loosely based on the structure of neurons in the brain\u2014they can also be built with simple physical systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Bob throws rocks into the pond, while Alice watches the waves and tries to predict what\u2019s coming next. Credit: Yaroslav Maksymov, Author provided\n             \n\n\nReservoir computers are analogue computers. An analogue computer represents data continuously, as opposed to digital computers which represent data as abruptly changing binary \"zero\" and \"one\" states.\nRepresenting data in a continuous way enables analogue computers to model certain natural events\u2014ones that occur in a kind of unpredictable sequence called a \"chaotic time series\"\u2014better than a digital computer.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nHow to make predictions\nTo understand how we can use a reservoir computer to make predictions, imagine you have a record of daily rainfall for the past year and a bucket full of water near you. The bucket will be our \"computational reservoir.\"\nWe input the daily rainfall record to the bucket by means of stone. For a day of light rain, we throw a small stone; for a day of heavy rain, a big stone. For a day of no rain, we throw no rock.\nEach stone creates waves, which then slosh around the bucket and interact with waves created by other stones.\nAt the end of this process, the state of the water in the bucket gives us a prediction. If the interactions between waves create large new waves, we can say our reservoir computer predicts heavy rains. But if they are small then we should expect only light rain.\nIt is also possible that the waves will cancel one another, forming a still water surface. In that case we should not expect any rain.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Our reservoir computer used solitary waves like those seen in drinking fountains. Credit: Ivan Maksymov, Author provided\n             \n\n\nThe reservoir makes a weather forecast because the waves in the bucket and rainfall patterns evolve over time following the same laws of physics.\nSo do many other natural and socio-economic processes. This means a reservoir computer can also forecast financial markets and even certain kinds of human activity.\nLonger-lasting waves\nThe \"bucket of water\" reservoir computer has its limits. For one thing, the waves are short-lived. To forecast complex processes such as climate change and population growth, we need a reservoir with more durable waves.\nOne option is \"solitons.\" These are self-reinforcing waves that keep their shape and move for long distances.\nFor our reservoir computer, we used compact soliton-like waves. You often see such waves in a bathroom sink or a drinking fountain.\nIn our computer, a thin layer of water flows over a slightly inclined metal plate. A small electric pump changes the speed of the flow and creates solitary waves.\nWe added a fluorescent material to make the water glow under ultraviolet light, to precisely measure the size of the waves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pump plays the role of falling stones in the game played by Alice and Bob, but the solitary waves correspond to the waves on the water surface. Solitary waves move much faster and live longer than water waves in a bucket, which lets our computer process data at a higher speed.\nSo, how does it perform?\nWe tested our computer's ability to remember past inputs and to make forecasts for a benchmark set of chaotic and random data. Our computer not only executed all tasks exceptionally well but also outperformed a high-performance digital computer tasked with the same problem.\nWith my colleague Andrey Pototsky, we also created a mathematical model that enabled us to better understand the physical properties of the solitary waves.\nNext, we plan to miniaturize our computer as a microfluidic processor. Water waves should be able to do computations inside a chip that operates similarly to the silicon chips used in every smartphone.\nIn the future, our computer may be able to produce reliable long-term forecasts in areas such as climate change, bushfires and financial markets\u2014with much lower cost and wider availability than current supercomputers.\nOur computer is also naturally immune to cyber attacks because it does not use digital data.\nOur vision is that a soliton-based microfluidic reservoir computer will bring data science and machine learning to rural and remote communities worldwide. But for now, our research work continues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIvan Maksymov et al, Reservoir computing based on solitary-like waves dynamics of liquid film flows: A proof of concept, Europhysics Letters (2023).

   "text": "The quality factor (Q) is a critical parameter that characterizes the strength of light-matter interactions. Cavities with higher quality factors have the ability to efficiently confine light and thus enhance light-matter interactions. This feature holds significant importance in various applications such as lasers, filters, harmonic generation, and sensors.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent schemes have been proposed to improve quality factors in microcavities, such as microdisks, Bragg reflector microcavities, and photonic crystals. Above the light cone of band structures, bound states without radiative leakage of energy are also accessible, namely bound states in the continuum (BIC). BIC provides a generalized method to obtain ultrahigh quality factor resonances, thereby becoming a powerful mechanism to enhance light-matter interactions that have found applications in low-threshold lasers, multi-spectral sensing, and high harmonics generation.\nFor a typical BIC, there is a quadratic quantitative relation between Q and wave vector (k), and usually a tiny disturbance in k would lead to a rapid deterioration of Q. However, defects and disorders are inevitably introduced during processing which greatly reduce the quality factor of resonances in actual samples. The idea of merging BIC starts with modulating the exponential coefficient between Q and k (from -2 to -6), which largely alleviates the deterioration rate of Q and provides a very effective mechanism.\nBut this approach requires precise control of the geometric dimensions of microstructures and is only applicable to band structures that simultaneously have symmetry-protected and accidental BICs, with rather harsh requirements.\nRecently, Longqing Cong's group at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) published a research paper entitled \"Hybrid bound states in the continuum in terahertz metasurfaces\" in Opto-Electronic Science (OES). They proposed a more generalized approach to improve the overall quality factors and robustness of symmetry-protected BIC.\nUnlike the conventional approach of achieving quasi-BIC by breaking symmetry of resonators uniformly in the entire lattice of metamaterials (see Fig. 1a and b), they selectively maintain the local C2 symmetry of the entire lattice so that radiative loss could be decreased and the quality factor of the array is improved (see Fig. 1c).\n\n\n\n\n\n                Fig. 2. Significant Q improvement in hybrid BIC lattices and robustness against fabrication imperfections. (a) Evolution of radiative Q versus asymmetry degree for U-qBIC, Ht-BIC, Hx-BIC and Hq-BIC lattices.

Credit: Opto-Electronic Science (2023). DOI: 10.29026/oes.2023.230006\n             \n\n\nThis is a generalized method that could be extended to any symmetry-protected BIC without requirements of accurate geometric design or band selectivity. According to qualitative and quantitative analysis, the hybrid BIC lattice can achieve a quality factor more than 14.6 times higher than that of the conventional lattice (Fig. 2a). By increasing the proportional coefficient between Q and k, the quality factor robustness of the hybrid BIC metasurfaces against disorders and other disturbances is improved, thereby effectively reducing the deterioration of the quality factor in actual devices. This provides a more generalized and simple approach to achieving a high-quality factor (Fig.2b).\n\n\n\n\n\n                Fig. 3. Generalized high-order hybrid BIC.

Multiple high-quality factor Fano resonances are very important in pulse generation, sensing, communication, etc., especially for the development of sensing and next-generation wireless communication based on terahertz photonics. This offers novel insights into fusing metasurfaces and terahertz photonics to facilitate their development in diverse fields.\nThis work will further enrich the physical implication of BIC and broaden the perspective of metamaterials and terahertz photonics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJunxing Fan et al, Hybrid bound states in the continuum in terahertz metasurfaces, Opto-Electronic Science (2023).

   "text": "In recent decades, the development of nano-fabrication technology is driven by the need to increase the density of components and performance, which requires high accuracy in material processing and the capability of manufacturing in an atmospheric environment. Compared to other advanced processing methods, ultrafast laser processing has been recognized as one of the most extensively used tools for micro/nano-structuring.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the key challenge of ultrafast laser processing to produce extremely small features is the optical diffraction limit. The heat affected zone via these techniques is still much larger than the nano-structures, which mostly exhibit >300 nm melting zone.\nUsing a dielectric microsphere as a near-field lens for super-resolution nano-imaging and nano-fabrication has attracted great research interest. The optical phenomenon known as photonic nano-jet can contribute to laser beam focusing to overcome the diffraction limit. To increase the microsphere ultrafast laser processing throughput, the self-assembly method and micro-lens arrays lithography have been developed to fabricate surface patterns at a fast speed and low cost.\nIn addition to nano-hole structures achieved by contact mode, the microsphere femtosecond laser fabrication can also realize arbitrary structures on sample surfaces in non-contact mode. By lifting the microsphere to form a gap between the sample and the microsphere, the working distance can be increased to several micrometers.\nThis strategy leads to the microsphere working in far field. In this case, the feature size of surface structures can only be reduced to ~300 nm by the 405 nm lamp, 512 nm, and 800 nm femtosecond laser irradiation, which is still far from the optical diffraction limit. Thus, how to achieve a good balance between the working distance and feature size is a vital issue for microsphere assisted laser fabrication.\nTo overcome these problems, the research group of Prof. Minghui Hong from Xiamen University and the National University of Singapore, and Prof. Tun Cao from Dalian University of Technology jointly reported an ultrafast laser processing technology based on non-contact microspheres, realizing <50 nm functional nano-patternings on the surface of phase change materials. The research is published in the journal Opto-Electronic Advances.\nIn non-contact mode, the microsphere is placed on a specially designed holder, and the nano-structures can be obtained by flexibly controlling of microsphere in x-y-z scanning. In this case, the distance between the microsphere and the sample is in the order of microns. Via the femtosecond laser irradiation of microsphere, this new technology enables the high speed machining of finer feature nano-structures in non-contact mode in various conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Fig. 2. Formation mechanism of microsphere assisted femtosecond laser irradiation. Credit: Compuscript Ltd\n             \n\n\nThe researchers also analyzed and explained the forming mechanism of these nanostructures. By theoretical calculation, the focused spot size of the incident laser passing through the 50 \u00b5m microsphere is only ~678 nm. Due to the nonlinear effects of ultrafast laser, including two-photon absorption and top threshold effect, the feature of nano-structures can be reduced down to sub-50 nm. Therefore, the surface nano-structures are attributed to the co-effect of the microsphere focusing, the two-photon absorption, and the top threshold effect of the ultrafast laser irradiation.\nThis method provides a new idea for ultrafine laser surface nano-machining, and its machining efficiency and machining freedom are expected to be further optimized and improved via microsphere array and microsphere engineering.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tZhenyuan Lin et al, Microsphere femtosecond laser sub-50 nm structuring in far field via non-linear absorption, Opto-Electronic Advances (2023).

The resulting image is not a photograph; rather, it is a three-dimensional representation of the scene. A person can view the 3D representation using interactive software or by 3D-printing a model, Brady said.\n\"The problem in imaging is that photographs and imaging systems only form two-dimensional images, but the world is really three-dimensional,\" said Brady, whose sparse holography work earned him the 2023 Emmett N. Leith Medal from Optica, an international organization dedicated to optics and photonics.\nBrady said his research interests have always revolved around optical imaging, and sparse holography became a natural extension over the years. Sparse holography is part of a broader project on efficient 3D imaging systems that Brady and his research group have been pursuing for 20 years.\n\"The core research interest for my group is how to push optical measurements to the physical limits of what's possible,\" Brady said.\nIn 2012, Brady and his team developed the world's first gigapixel camera by integrating 98 micro-cameras in a single device. The images taken with the camera showed unprecedented detail.\nBrady's sparse holography technique can be used in situations where 3D images are needed, including instances in which there are moving objects that need to be made three-dimensional.\nNormally, it is not possible to create 3D images of moving objects, such as living tissue or organisms viewed through a microscope, Brady said. Sparse holography makes it a possibility.\n\"We can form three-dimensional images of a swimming fish or moving things,\" he said.\nSparse holography can also be used to measure 3D scenes for self-driving cars or video games, he said.\nBrady's group has put sparse holography to use in real-world scenarios such as X-ray systems and many types of cameras.\nAs sophisticated as they may sound, computational imaging tools are becoming more user-friendly and getting better all the time, Brady said.\n\"We can capture very high-frame-rate images, very high-resolution images, and use these computational imaging tools to push the limits of resolution in space, time and dimensionality,\" he said.\nBrady was awarded the Emmett N. Leith Medal for his work in March. The medal was established in 2006 in honor of Emmett N. Leith, a world-renowned scientist in holography and optical information processing, to recognize seminal contributions to the field.\nIn the future, Brady's research group is planning to develop \"super cameras,\" out of arrays of micro cameras, that would be akin to supercomputers that are constructed from smaller computers. Brady's team is using holographic measurements on an array of cameras to increase the size of the aperture, which is the opening through which light can enter the camera. Sparse holography enables cameras to resolve features smaller than a human hair from across an area as large as a football field, Brady said.\nWith recent advances in artificial intelligence-generated images and manipulated \"deepfakes,\" everyone recognizes that we are in the midst of fundamental changes in the nature of imaging systems, Brady said.\n\"While artificial intelligence will change our interaction with data, the underlying story is the computational imaging is increasing our ability to see the world,\" he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversity of Arizona\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSparse holography: A novel method for creating 3D images (2023, May 26)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tretrieved 15 June 2023\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom https://phys.org/news/2023-05-sparse-holography-method-3d-images.html\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This document is subject to copyright.

   "text": "Solvated dielectrons are the subject of many hypotheses among scientists, but have never been directly observed. They are described as a pair of electrons that is dissolved in liquids such as water or liquid ammonia. To make space for the electrons a cavity forms in the liquid that the two electrons occupy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn international research team led by Dr. Sebastian Hartweg, initially at Synchrotron SOLEIL (France), now at the Institute of Physics at the University of Freiburg and Prof. Dr. Ruth Signorell from ETH Zurich, including scientists from the synchrotron SOLEIL and Auburn University has now succeeded in discovering a formation and decay process of the solvated dielectron.\nIn experiments at the synchrotron SOLEIL (DESIRS beamline), the consortium found direct evidence supported by quantum chemical calculations for the formation of these electron pairs by excitation with ultraviolet light in tiny ammonia droplets containing a single sodium atom. The results were recently published in the journal Science.\nTraces of an unusual process\nWhen dielectrons are formed by excitation with ultraviolet light in tiny ammonia droplets containing a sodium atom, they leave traces in an unusual process that scientists have now been able to observe for the first time. In this process, one of the two electrons migrates to the neighboring solvent molecules, while at the same time the other electron is ejected. \"The surprising thing about this is that similar processes have previously been observed mainly at much higher excitation energies,\" says Hartweg.\nThe team focused on this second electron because there could be interesting applications for it. On the one hand, the ejected electron is produced with very low kinetic energy, so it moves very slowly. On the other hand, this energy can be controlled by the irradiated UV light, which starts the whole process. Solvated dielectrons could thus serve as a good source of low-energy electrons.\nGenerated specifically with variable energy\nSuch slow electrons can set a wide variety of chemical processes in motion. For example, they play a role in the cascade of processes that lead to radiation damage in biological tissue. They are also important in synthetic chemistry, where they serve as effective reducing agents.\nBy being able to selectively generate slow electrons with variable energy, the mechanisms of such chemical processes can be studied in more detail in the future. In addition, the energy made available to the electrons in a controlled manner might also be used to increase the effectiveness of reduction reactions.\n\"These are interesting prospects for possible applications in the future,\" says Hartweg. \"Our work provides the basis for this and helps to understand these exotic and still enigmatic solvated dielectrons a little better.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSebastian Hartweg et al, Solvated dielectrons from optical excitation: An effective source of low-energy electrons, Science (2023).

The team's findings demonstrating that there may be an alternative route to realize programmable active matter have been published in Science Advances.\nResearchers are looking for new ways to perform tasks on the micro- and nanoscale that are otherwise difficult to realize, particularly as the miniaturization of devices and components is beginning to reach physical limits. One new option being considered is the use of collectives of robotic units in place of a single robot to complete a task.\n\"The task-solving capabilities of one microrobot are limited due to its small size,\" said Professor Thomas Speck, who headed the study at Mainz University. \"But a collective of such robots working together may well be able to carry out complex assignments with considerable success.\" Statistical physics becomes relevant here in that it analyzes models to describe how such collective behavior may emerge from interactions, comparable to bird behavior when they flock together.\nThe research team studied the collective behavior of a number of small, commercially available robots. These so-called walkers are propelled through internal vibrations transmitted to two rows of tiny legs. Because the length, shape, and stiffness of the legs differ slightly from robot to robot, they follow circular orbits with a radius that is specific to each individual walker. Looking and moving like little beetles, these robots have an elliptical form and are sent off in a new direction when they happen to collide with each other.\n\"Our aim was to examine and describe the collective behavior of these robots and determine whether it might be possible to derive potential uses from this,\" added Frank Siebers, lead author of the paper. \"At the same time, we as physicists were also interested in the phenomena per se.\" The researchers were able to observe two effects when the collective of robots has variations in terms of their orbits, i.e., in a group showing greater diversity. First, the walkers required less time to explore the space they were placed in. And second, when contained within an enclosed space, they began to undergo self-organized sorting. Depending on their orbital radius, the robots either accumulated at the confining wall or began to gather within the interior of the space.\nStatistical physics provides insights into the behavior of collectives\n\"It would be possible to exploit this kind of activity to get robots to transport a load and to interact with that load, for example. The speed with which they would be able to traverse spaces would increase, meaning that the load would be delivered sooner,\" said Speck, outlining one potential application. \"Statistical physics can help to uncover new strategies that may be utilized by collectives of robots.\"\nThe field of active matter models and robotics covers many realms of the living and the nonliving world in which collective behavior or collective movement can be observed, one prominent example being the way that flocks of birds move in unison. \"What we have done here is to apply the theory underlying our understanding of clustering and swarming to robotic systems,\" said Siebers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrank Siebers et al, Exploiting compositional disorder in collectives of light-driven circle walkers, Science Advances (2023).

These short-lived, rare nuclei contain at least one \"hyperon\" in addition to ordinary protons and neutrons.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHyperons contain at least one \"strange\" quark in place of one of the up or down quarks that make up ordinary nucleons (the collective name for protons and neutrons). Such strange matter is thought to be abundant in the hearts of neutron stars, which are among the densest, most exotic objects in the universe. While blasting off to neutron stars to study this exotic matter is still the stuff of science fiction, particle collisions could give scientists insight into these celestial objects from a laboratory right here on Earth.\n\"The conditions in a neutron star may still be far from what we reach at this moment in the laboratory, but at this stage it's the closest we can get,\" said Xin Dong, a physicist from the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) who was involved in the study. \"By comparing our data from this laboratory environment to our theories, we can try to infer what happens in the neutron star.\"\nThe scientists used the STAR detector at RHIC, a DOE Office of Science user facility for nuclear physics research at Brookhaven National Laboratory, to study the flow patterns of the debris emitted from collisions of gold nuclei. Those patterns are triggered by the enormous pressure gradients generated in the collisions. By comparing the flow of hypernuclei with that of similar ordinary nuclei made only of nucleons, they hoped to gain insight into interactions between the hyperons and nucleons.\n\"In our normal world, nucleon-nucleon interactions form normal atomic nuclei. But when we move into a neutron star, hyperon-nucleon interactions\u2014which we don't know much about yet\u2014become very relevant to understanding the structure,\" said Yapeng Zhang, another member of STAR from the Institute of Modern Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who led the data analysis together with his student Chenlu Hu. Tracking how hypernuclei flow should give the scientists insight into the hyperon-nucleon interactions that form these exotic particles.\nThe data, just published in Physical Review Letters, will provide quantitative information theorists can use to refine their descriptions of the hyperon-nucleon interactions that drive the formation of hypernuclei\u2014and the large-scale structure of neutron stars.\n\"There are no solid calculations to really establish these hyperon-nucleon interactions,\" said Zhang. \"This measurement may potentially constrain theories and provide a variable input for the calculations.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nGo with the flow\nPrevious experiments have shown that the flow patterns of regular nuclei generally scale with mass\u2014meaning the more protons and neutrons a nucleus has, the more the nuclei exhibit collective flow in a particular direction. This indicates that these nuclei inherit their flow from their constituent protons and neutrons, which coalesce, or come together, because of their interactions, which are governed by the strong nuclear force.\nThe STAR results reported in this paper show that hypernuclei follow this same mass-scaling pattern. That means hypernuclei most likely form via the same mechanism.\n\"In the coalescence mechanism, the nuclei (and hypernuclei) form this way depending on how strong the interactions are between the individual components,\" Dong said. \"This mechanism gives us information about the interaction between the nucleons (in nuclei) and nucleons and hyperons in hypernuclei.\"\nSeeing similar flow patterns and the mass scaling relationship for both normal nuclei and hypernuclei, the scientists say, implies that the nucleon-nucleon and hyperon-nucleon interactions are very similar.\nThe flow patterns also convey information about the matter generated in the particle smashups\u2014including how hot and dense it is and other properties.\n\"The pressure gradient created in the collision will induce some asymmetry in the outgoing particle direction. So, what we observe, the flow, reflects how the pressure gradient is created inside the nuclear matter,\" Zhang said.\n\"The measured flow of hypernuclei may open a new door to study hyperon-nucleon interactions under finite pressure at high baryon density.\"\nThe scientists will use additional measurements of how hypernuclei interact with that medium to learn more about its properties.\nThe benefits of low energy\nThis research would not have been possible without the versatility of RHIC to operate over such a wide range of collision energies. The measurements were made during Phase I of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan\u2014a systematic study of gold-gold collisions ranging from 200 GeV per colliding particle pair down to 3 GeV.\nTo reach that lowest energy, RHIC operated in \"fixed-target\" mode: One beam of gold ions traveling around the 2.4-mile-circumference RHIC collider crashed into a foil made of gold placed inside the STAR detector. That low energy gives scientists access to the highest \"baryon density,\" a measure related to the pressure generated in the collisions.\n\"At this lowest collision energy, where the matter created in the collision is very dense, nuclei and hypernuclei are produced more abundantly than at higher collision energies,\" said Yue-Hang Leung, a postdoctoral fellow from the University of Heidelberg, Germany. \"The low-energy collisions are the only ones that produce enough of these particles to give us the statistics we need to do the analysis. Nobody else has ever done this before.\"\nHow does what the scientists learned at RHIC relate to neutron stars?\nThe fact that hypernuclei appear to form via coalescence just like ordinary nuclei implies that they, like those ordinary nuclei, are created at a late stage of evolution of the collision system.\n\"At this late stage, the density for the hyperon-nucleon interaction we see is not that high,\" Dong said. \"So, these experiments may not be directly simulating the environment of a neutron star.\"\nBut, he added, \"This data is fresh. We need our theory friends to weigh in. And they need to include this new data on hyperon-nucleon interactions when they build a new neutron star model. We need both experimentalists and our theorists' efforts to work towards understanding this data and making those connections.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tB.

   "text": "A research team at the Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS) led by Professor Roberto Morandotti reported the first realization of a single-shot ultrafast terahertz (THz) photography system.

This is mainly due to the severe lack of key devices in the THz frequency regime, such as high-speed modulators and cameras, which are typically indispensable for ultrafast imaging.\n\"This work is a major achievement from our team and collaborators in the field of optics. By taking advantage of the unique penetration ability of THz radiation, our system was able to capture ultrashort events in optically opaque scenarios, which are typically not accessible via conventional optical frequencies,\" says Professor Roberto Morandotti, Scientific Leader of the Ultrahigh Speed Light Manipulation Laboratory and corresponding author of the study.\n\"We have successfully unlocked single-shot ultrafast imaging in the THz regime. Thanks to our work, we can now capture a movie of irreversible ultrafast phenomena with an inter-frame time interval of less than 1 picosecond,\" states Junliang Dong, research associate in Morandotti's laboratory at INRS and first author of the study.\nUltrafast imaging using terahertz radiation \nSingle-shot ultrafast photography has emerged as a key technique to elucidate the complex dynamics underlying various ultrafast phenomena in nature. Propelled by recent advances in the fields of ultrafast lasers, high-speed cameras, and computational imaging, single-shot ultrafast optical imaging has been able to capture two-dimensional (2D) transient scenes at more than one trillion frames per second, fast enough to visualize optical pulses traveling through space at the speed of light.\nHowever, state-of-the-art single-shot ultrafast imaging techniques require the imaging targets to be optically transparent. This restriction prevents such techniques from exploring many critical ultrafast phenomena that occur in media with a short optical penetration depth, such as the dynamics of laser ablation in ceramics, magnetization in iron films, and carrier excitations in semiconductors.\nRecently, imaging using THz radiation has garnered significant interest due to its ability to 'see through' various materials. However, single-shot ultrafast THz imaging is still in the embryonic stage due to the absence of high-speed THz cameras.\nIn this study, Morandotti's team from the INRS \u00c9nergie Mat\u00e9riaux T\u00e9l\u00e9communications Research Centre exploited the electro-optic sampling technique for THz detection with a carefully designed optical probe beam, which is simultaneously multiplexed in the time and spatial-frequency domains.\n\"Since it only relies on commonly available optical components, such as beam splitters, optical delay lines, gratings, and CCD cameras, our technique essentially bypasses the need for any THz high-speed devices. Even so, it is powerful enough to record the ultrafast scenes carried by THz waves in a single shot,\" explains Professor Morandotti.\nOccurring in a two-dimensional space and femtosecond-to-picosecond timescales, real-time imaging of these transient events reflects various fundamental mechanisms that remain complex and mostly inaccessible, such as chemical reactions and light-matter interactions.\nConventionally, pump-probe methods are used to record ultrafast dynamics through repeated measurements. Nevertheless, many ultrafast phenomena have significant shot-to-shot variations and low occurrence rates, thus making them \"non-repeatable.\"\nAccording to the researchers, their system is envisioned to be an unprecedented tool for the investigation of non-repeatable or destructive dynamics in advanced materials and structures, such as 2D materials, and even biological matter, like skin and corneas, which are typically optically opaque.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJunliang Dong et al, Single-shot ultrafast terahertz photography, Nature Communications (2023).

   "text": "In biomedical technology, tissue engineering for the ex-vivo production of skin or organs is becoming increasingly important. This requires biocompatible microfibers with enclosed microcapsules of controlled size and shape, as the cells used for tissue engineering must be embedded in material that is as similar as possible to the natural arrangement in vivo.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil now, the production of such fibers at low output has been quite costly and time-consuming. Researchers at Graz University of Technology (TU Graz) have now developed a new method for producing microfibers with the desired properties that can be used in pharmaceuticals and biomedicine, and which provides significantly higher yields than previous methods while requiring much less production effort.\nIn a paper published in Physical Review Applied, Carole Planchette and her team from the Institute of Fluid Mechanics and Heat Transfer at TU Graz explain how their development can produce several meters of this microfiber in seconds. The current methods manage at most a few centimeters in the same period of time.\nThis acceleration has been made possible by moving away from the production of microfibers in a liquid environment using microfluidic chips to a production that is possible in sterile room air. As a result, the necessary process steps as well as the costs were greatly reduced and potential sources of errors and blockages minimized.\nDroplets meet liquid jet\nIn the new method, a regular stream of droplets containing cells or active substances is combined with a liquid jet of aqueous alginic acid solution. The alginic acid obtained from brown algae forms upon contact with calcium cations an elastic hydrogel called alginate\u2014similarly to the process commonly used in molecular cuisine to form caviar pearls.\nThis hydrogel is fully biocompatible and also prevents the embedded droplets from coalescing together. Therefore, to cure the alginic acid solution stream, a second stream with calcium cations is jetted continuously on top. The resulting fiber, which can be grown at up to 5 meters per second, can then simply be collected on a turntable. All these steps take place in the air and not in liquid microfluidic production as before.\nIn a few years, it should be possible to produce a fiber assembly mimicking the skin from human cells using this new method. The integration of cells into the microfiber is the next step for Planchette and her team. The expected result could be, for example, a great help for burn victims, as new and personalized skin for transplantation could be produced from a patient's own intact skin cells in a very short time.\nIn this perspective, researchers at TU Graz are working together with the Medical University of Graz on research into the production of artificial skin. Looking much further into the future, certainly more than ten years, one day it may also be possible to produce artificial organs using this microfiber.\n\n\n\n\n\n                (a) Kinetic and geometric parameters relevant for the production of fibers with regular inclusions. (b) Pictures of the collisions observed in the collision plane. The collisions between the droplets and jet1 enable the formation of the liquid drops-in-jet structure, which subsequently solidifies thanks to the supply of cations ensured by the collision with jet2.

DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevApplied.19.054006\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacement for animal testing\nIn addition to tissue engineering, the new and faster production method opens up other areas of application for the biocompatible microfiber, such as cell screening. In the near future, it will be possible to test new molecules for medical agents much more extensively on cells to determine whether or at what point they are toxic.\nDue to the available fiber length, different temperatures or concentrations could be tested in a single run. For such tests on a large scale, animal experiments have been used up to now, and this could be largely avoided.\n\"For me, it is particularly interesting when I can use fundamental aspects of fluid mechanics to find new and innovative solutions to previously unsolved problems,\" explains Planchette.\n\"This allows us to discover pathways to new applications and our manufacturing method of biocompatible microfibers with regular inclusions at high output and low cost demonstrates this. The possibilities for cell screening, tissue construction and eventually organ production that this opens up can be of great benefit to many disciplines. For me, this is also a clear sign of how important the role of basic and multidisciplinary research is, thereby creating the fundament for ground-breaking applications.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrancesco Marangon et al, In-Air Microfluidic Strategy for the Production of Sodium Alginate Fibers with Regular Inclusions at Very High Throughput, Physical Review Applied (2023).

   "text": "Identifying new sources that produce electrons faster could help to advance the many imaging techniques that rely on electrons. In a recent paper published in Physical Review Letters, a team of researchers at Eindhoven University of Technology demonstrated the scattering of subpicosecond electron bunches from an ultracold electron source.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our research group is working to develop the next generation of ultrafast electron sources to push imaging techniques such as ultrafast electron diffraction to the next level,\" Tim de Raadt, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org.\n\"The idea of using laser-cooled ultracold gas clouds as an electron source to improve the state-of-the-art in brightness was first introduced in a paper published in 2005. Since then, research efforts have produced multiple versions of such a ultracold electron source, with the most recent one (used in this work) focusing on making the source compact, easy to align and operate, and being more stable, as described in another past paper that also studied the transverse electron beam properties.\"\nThe primary objective of the recent work by de Raadt and his colleagues was to further assess the performance of the type of compact laser cooled ultracold source identified in their previous work, particularly looking at its longitudinal beam properties. By better understanding the physics behind this source, they could optimize its performance and enable its use to advance imaging techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\n                A schematic representation of the researchers' experiment. Credit: de Raadt, Franssen & Luiten. (PRL, 2023)\n             \n\n\nThe researchers' source was created by photoionizing laser-cooled rubidium gas in a grating magneto-optical trap via a two-step process. In the self-compression point of this source, they measured electron bunches as short as 735\u00b17\u2009\u2009fs (rms).\n\"We fired a very intense femtosecond laser pulse onto the electron bunch at the position in which the electron bunch has the shortest bunch length,\" de Raadt explained. \"When the laser pulse hits the electrons, it can scatter them out of the bunch, which is called 'ponderomotive scattering.' With the electron camera at the end of the beamline we can see these electrons that have been kicked out of the bunch as two stripes coming out of the electron bunch.\"\nIf the researchers shot their laser pulse onto an electron bunch too soon or too late, they would not hit it and would thus fail to see the desired outwards electron scattering. In their experiments, they tried to determine for how long they would be able to scatter these electrons (i.e., measuring the length of the electron bunch), by slowly changing the delay time between the firing of the laser pulse and the electron bunch. This experiment showed that the electron bunch originating from their source was in the subpicosecond scale, which had never been observed before.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Electrons being scattered out of the main bunch using a intense laser pulse to measure the electron bunch length, Credit: de Raadt, Franssen & Luiten. (PRL, 2023)\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We found that the longitudinal beam quality (emittance) is not limited by the electron temperature, as is the case for the transverse beam quality (emittances), but rather by the combination of the ionization process (the way in which the electrons leave the atoms) and the energy spread,\" de Raadt said.\n\"Furthermore, since it turns out the ionization process itself takes about a picosecond, there is no need for us to use a femtosecond ionization laser pulse. We can thus increase the ionization laser pulse length by a factor of ten without impacting the electron bunch length (longitudinal quality), which allows us to use a narrower band and more precise laser wavelength. This opens a new way to improve the transverse beam quality (emittance).\"\nThe recent work by de Raadt and his colleagues highlights the value of the compact ultracold source they realized for producing ultrafast electron bunches. In addition, after their studying the physics and properties of this source further, the team can now predict how short its electron pulses will be with high precision. This in turn allows them to shorten these pulses at the expense of energy spreading through the source or vice-versa.\nIn the future, the findings gathered by this team of researchers could pave the way for the development of highly performing imaging techniques that could advance research in numerous fields. In their next studies, de Raadt and his colleagues will start exploring some of the most promising applications of the electron source.\n\"Now that the physics behind the ultracold electron source is well understood, and the properties have been measured, the source is moving from an experimental proof of principle to a reliable electron source,\" de Raadt added.\n\"This source can be used for various exciting applications, such as potentially single-shot, ultrafast electron crystallography of proteins, which would be revolutionary. As a new novel application, this source would be ideally suited as injector for dielectric laser acceleration. Our future studies will therefore be focused on applications that are only possible using the unique properties of this source.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tT.\u2009C.\u2009H. de Raadt et al, Subpicosecond ultracold electron source.

They are used in solar cells, where they can improve the efficiency of energy conversion, biological imaging, where they can be used as fluorescent probes, electronic displays, and even quantum computing, where their ability to trap and manipulate individual electrons can be exploited.\nHowever, getting semiconductor quantum dots to efficiently conduct electricity has been a major challenge, impeding their full use. This is primarily due to their lack of orientational order in assemblies. According to Satria Zulkarnaen Bisri, lead researcher on the project, \"making them metallic would enable, for example, quantum dot displays that are brighter yet use less energy than current devices.\"\nNow, the group has published a study in Nature Communications that could make a major contribution to reaching that goal. The group, led by Bisri and Yoshihiro Iwasa of RIKEN CEMS, has created a superlattice of lead sulfide semiconducting colloidal quantum dots that displays the electrical conducting properties of a metal.\nThe key to achieving this was to get the individual quantum dots in the lattice to attach to one another directly, \"epitaxially,\" without ligands, and to do this with their facets oriented in a precise way.\nThe researchers tested the conductivity of the material they created, and as they increased the carrier density using a electric, double-layer transistor, they found that at a certain point it became a million times more conductive than what is currently available from quantum dot displays. Importantly, the quantum confinement of the individual quantum dots was still maintained, meaning that they don't lose their functionality despite the high conductivity.\n\"Semiconductor quantum dots have always shown promise for their optical properties, but their electronic mobility has been a challenge,\" says Iwasa. \"Our research has demonstrated that precise orientation control of the quantum dots in the assembly can lead to high electronic mobility and metallic behavior. This breakthrough could open up new avenues for using semiconductor quantum dots in emerging technologies.\"\nAccording to Bisri, \"We plan to carry out further studies with this class of materials, and believe it could lead to vast improvements in the capabilities of quantum dot superlattices.

   "text": "In an era marked by an escalating energy crisis, the world stands on the precipice of a transformative revolution in spintronics technology, promising ultra-low power consumption paired with superior performance. To illustrate the potential, consider this: the power consumed by AlphaGo during its famous Go game in 2016 equaled the daily power use of 100 households. By 2021, Tesla's autonomous driving AI required over ten times that amount of power for learning.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response to this growing demand, the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) has pioneered the world's first transistor capable of controlling skyrmions. This breakthrough paves the way for the development of next-generation ultra-low-power devices and is anticipated to make significant contributions to quantum and AI research. The findings are published in the journal Advanced Materials.\nSkyrmions, arranged in a vortex-like spin structure, are unique because they can be miniaturized to several nanometers, making them movable with exceptionally low power. This characteristic positions them as a crucial element in the evolution of spintronics applications.\nThe explosive growth of electronic engineering in the 21st century can be traced back to the 1947 invention of the transistor at Bell Laboratories in the United States. Acting as an amplifier and switch for electrical currents, the transistor has been pivotal in the field of electronic engineering. The discovery of the skyrmion in 2009 sparked widespread research into a skyrmion-based transistor, but the absence of essential technology to control skyrmion movement thwarted these efforts.\nThis bottleneck has been overcome with KRISS's newly developed skyrmion transistor, which leverages proprietary technology to electronically manage the movement of skyrmions created in magnetic materials. This innovative solution enables the precise control of skyrmion flow or halting, akin to how conventional transistors modulate electric current.\nA critical aspect of managing magnetic skyrmion movement lies in controlling magnetic anisotropy, which influences the energy of skyrmions. Previous research endeavored to regulate magnetic anisotropy through oxygen movement within devices but failed to achieve uniform control.\nOvercoming this challenge, the KRISS Quantum Spin Team developed a groundbreaking method for uniform control of magnetic anisotropy by leveraging hydrogen within aluminum oxide insulators, marking a world-first in the experimental implementation of skyrmion transistors.\nThis milestone represents yet another foundational technology for spintronic devices, following the institute's 2021 achievement in the generation, deletion, and movement of skyrmions. The advent of the spintronics transistor is set to expedite the development of spintronics-based devices, such as neuromorphic and logic devices, which offer substantial advantages in power consumption, stability, and speed over traditional electronic devices.\nDr. Chan Yong Hwang, a director of the KRISS Quantum Technology Institute, says, \"Major Korean companies are pivoting their focus to next-generation semiconductors that utilize spintronics to transcend the constraints of current silicon semiconductors. We plan to advance spintronics-related technology further and incorporate them into next-generation semiconductor devices and quantum technology.\"\nReflecting on the significance of the achievement, Dr. Seungmo Yang, a senior researcher at KRISS, says, \"The transistor ignited the digital revolution of the 20th century. Now, the skyrmion transistor is poised to catalyze a similar transformation, propelling the spintronics technology revolution of the 21st century.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSeungmo Yang et al, Magnetic Skyrmion Transistor Gated with Voltage\u2010Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy, Advanced Materials (2022).

   "text": "Scientists in Finland have developed a nanodevice that can measure the absolute power of microwave radiation down to the femtowatt level at ultra-low temperatures\u2014a scale trillion times lower than routinely used in verifiable power measurements. The device has the potential to significantly advance microwave measurements in quantum technology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantum science takes place mostly at ultra-low temperatures using devices called dilution refrigerators. The experiments also have to be done at tiny energy levels\u2014down to the energy level of single photons or even less. Researchers have to measure these extremely low energy levels as accurately as possible, which means also accounting for heat\u2014a persistent problem for quantum devices.\nTo measure heat in quantum experiments, scientists use a special type of thermometer called a bolometer. An exceptionally accurate bolometer was recently developed at Aalto University by a team led by Mikko M\u00f6tt\u00f6nen, associate professor of quantum technology at Aalto and VTT, but the device had more uncertainty than they had hoped for. Although it enabled them to observe the relative power level, they couldn't determine the absolute amount of energy very accurately.\nIn the new study, M\u00f6tt\u00f6nen's team worked with researchers at the quantum-technology companies Bluefors and IQM, and VTT Technical Research Center of Finland to improve the bolometer. The work was published today (May 25) as the Editor's Pick in the Review of Scientific Instruments.\n\"We added a heater to the bolometer, so we can apply a known heater current and measure the voltage. Since we know the precise amount of power we're putting into the heater, we can calibrate the power of the input radiation against the heater power. The result is a self-calibrating bolometer working at low temperatures, which allows us to accurately measure absolute powers at cryogenic temperatures,\" M\u00f6tt\u00f6nen says.\nAccording to Russell Lake, director of quantum applications at Bluefors, the new bolometer is a significant step forward in measuring microwave power.\n\"Commercial power sensors typically measure power at the scale of one milliwatt. This bolometer does that accurately and reliably at one femtowatt or below. That's a trillion times less power than used in typical power calibrations.\"\nCovering both deep and wide scales \nM\u00f6tt\u00f6nen explains that the new bolometer could improve the performance of quantum computers. \"For accurate results, the measurement lines used to control qubits should be at very low temperatures, [de]void of any thermal photons and excess radiation. Now with this bolometer, we can actually measure that radiation temperature without interference from the qubit circuitry,\" he says.\nThe bolometer also covers a broad range of frequencies.\n\"The sensor is broadband, which means that it can measure what is the power absorbed in various frequencies. This is not a given in quantum technology as usually the sensors are limited to a very narrow band,\" says Jean-Philippe Girard, a scientist at Bluefors who also previously worked at Aalto on the device.\nThe team says the bolometer provides a major boost to quantum technology fields.\n\"Measuring microwaves happens in wireless communications, radar technology, and many other fields. They have their ways of performing accurate measurements, but there was no way to do the same when measuring very weak microwave signals for quantum technology. The bolometer is an advanced diagnostic instrument that has been missing from the quantum technology toolbox until now,\" Lake says.\nThe work is a result of seamless collaboration between Aalto University and Bluefors, a perfect example of academy and industry complementing each other's strengths. The device was developed at Aalto's Quantum Computing and Devices (QCD) group, which is part of the Academy of Finland Center of Excellence in Quantum Technology (QTF). They used Micronova clean rooms that belong to the national research infrastructure OtaNano. Since the first experiments at Aalto, Bluefors has also successfully tested these devices in their own industrial facilities.\n\"That shows that this is not just a lucky break in a university lab, but something that both the industrial and the academic professionals working in quantum technology can benefit from,\" M\u00f6tt\u00f6nen says.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJ.-P.

By using the quantum properties of light to generate secure random keys for encrypting and decrypting data, its security is based on the laws of physics, rather than computational complexity like today's communication protocols.\n\"A key goal for QKD technology is the ability to simply integrate it into a real-world communications network,\" said research team member Rebecka Sax from the University of Geneva in Switzerland. \"An important and necessary step toward this goal is the use of integrated photonics, which allows optical systems to be manufactured using the same semiconductor technology used to make silicon computer chips.\"\nIn an article in Photonics Research, researchers led by University of Geneva's Hugo Zbinden describe their new QKD system, in which all components are integrated onto chips except the laser and detectors. This comes with many advantages such as compactness, low cost and ease of mass production.\n\"Although QKD can provide security for sensitive applications such as banking, health and defense, it is not yet a widespread technology,\" said Sax. \"This work justifies the technology maturity and helps address the technicalities around implementing it via optical integrated circuits, which would allow integration in networks and in other applications.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                Researchers have developed a quantum key distribution (QKD) system based on silicon photonics that can transmit secure keys at unprecedented speeds.

Credit: Rebecka Sax, University of Geneva\n             \n\n\nBuilding a faster chip-based system\nIn previous work, the researchers developed a three-state time-bin QKD protocol that was carried out with standard fiber-based components to achieve QKD transmission at record high speeds.\n\"Our goal in this new work was to implement the same protocol using integrated photonics,\" said Sax. \"The compactness, robustness and ease of manipulation of an integrated photonic system\u2014with less components to verify when implementing or to troubleshoot in a network\u2014improves the position of QKD as a technology for secure communication.\"\nQKD systems use a transmitter to send the encoded photons and a receiver to detect them. In the new work, the University of Geneva researchers collaborated with silicon photonics company Sicoya GmbH in Berlin, Germany, and quantum cybersecurity company ID Quantique in Geneva to develop a silicon photonics transmitter that combines a photonic integrated circuit with an external diode laser.\nThe QKD receiver was made of silica and consisted of a photonic integrated circuit and two external single-photon detectors. Roberto Osellame's group at the CNR Institute for Photonics and Nanotechnology in Milano, Italy, used femtosecond laser micromachining to fabricate the receiver.\n\"For the transmitter, using an external laser with a photonic and electronic integrated circuit made it possible to accurately produce and encode photons at a record speed of up 2.5 GHz,\" said Sax. \"For the receiver, a low-loss and polarization independent photonic integrated circuit and a set of external detectors allowed passive and simple detection of the transmitted photons.

The receiver not only featured polarization independence, which is complicated to achieve using integrated photonics, but also presented extremely low loss, around 3 dB.\n\"In terms of secret key rate production and quantum bit error rates, these new experiments produced results that are similar to those of previous experiments performed using fiber-based components,\" said Sax. \"However, the QKD system is much simpler and more practical than the previous experimental setups, thus displaying the feasibility of using this protocol with integrated circuits.\"\nThe researchers are now working to house the system parts in a simple rack enclosure that would allow QKD to be implemented in a network system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRebecka Sax et al, High-speed integrated QKD system, Photonics Research (2023).

   "text": "Despite their immense promise to solve new kinds of problems, today's quantum computers are inherently prone to error. A small perturbation in their surrounding environment\u2014 a change in temperature, pressure, or magnetic field, for instance\u2014can disrupt their fragile computational building blocks, called qubits.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, researchers at the University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering (PME) have developed a new method to constantly monitor the noise around a quantum system and adjust the qubits, in real-time, to minimize error.\nThe approach, described in Science, relies on spectator qubits: a set of qubits embedded in the computer with the sole purpose of measuring outside noise rather than storing data. The information gathered by such spectator qubits can then be used to cancel out noise in vital data-processing qubits.\nAsst. Prof. Hannes Bernien, who led the research, likens the new system to noise-canceling headphones, which continuously monitor surrounding noises and emit opposing frequencies to cancel them out.\n\"With this approach, we can very robustly improve the quality of the data qubits,\" said Bernien. \"I see this as being very important in the context of quantum computing and quantum simulation.\"\nA daunting challenge\nAs existing quantum computers are scaled up, the challenge of noise and error has grown. The problem is two-fold: Qubits easily change in response to their environment, which can alter the information stored inside them and lead to high rates of error. In addition, if a scientist measures a qubit, to try to gauge the noise it has been exposed to, the qubit state collapses, losing its data.\n\n\n\n\n\n                By combining spectator qubits (yellow) and data qubits (blue), PME researchers can constantly monitor\u2014and correct for\u2014noise and error within a quantum computer. Credit: Bernien Lab\n             \n\n\n\"It's a very daunting and difficult task to try to correct the errors within a quantum system,\" said Bernien.\nTheoretical physicists had previously proposed a solution using spectator qubits, a set of qubits that don't store any necessary data but could be embedded within a quantum computer. The spectator qubits would track changes in the environment, acting like the microphone contained within noise-canceling headphones. A microphone, of course, detects only sound waves while the proposed spectator qubits would respond to any environmental perturbations capable of altering qubits.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nTwo kinds of qubits for noise cancellation\nBernien's group set out to demonstrate that this theoretical concept could be used to cancel out noise in a neutral atom quantum array\u2014 their preferred quantum computer.\nIn a neutral atom quantum processor, atoms are suspended in place using laser beams called optical tweezers, which Bernien helped develop, earning him accolades such as the 2023 New Horizons in Physics Prize by the Breakthrough Prize Foundation. In large arrays of these suspended atoms, each acts as a qubit, capable of storing and processing information within its superposition state.\nIn 2022, Bernien and colleagues first reported the ability to make a hybrid atomic quantum processor containing both rubidium and cesium atoms. Now, they've adapted that processor so that the rubidium atoms act as data qubits while the cesium atoms are spectator qubits. The team designed a system to continuously read out real-time data from the rubidium atoms, and in response, tweak the cesium atoms with microwave oscillations.\nThe challenge, Bernien said, was ensuring that the system was quick enough\u2014 any adjustments to the rubidium atoms had to be nearly instantaneous.\n\"What's really exciting about this is that not only is it minimizing any noise for the data qubits, but it's an example of actually interacting with a quantum system in real time,\" said Bernien.\n\n\n\n\n\n                (From left): The new paper\u2019s authors are postdoctoral scholar Kevin Singh, postdoctoral scholar Conor Bradley, graduate student Shraddha Anand, Asst. Prof. Hannes Bernien, graduate student Ryan White, and graduate student Vikram Ramesh. Credit: John Zich\n             \n\n\nProof-of-principle\nTo test their error minimization approach, Bernien's group exposed the quantum array to magnetic field noise. They showed that the cesium atoms correctly picked up this noise and their system then canceled it out in the rubidium atoms in real time.\nHowever, the research group says the initial prototype is just a starting place. They'd like to try increasing the amount of noise and varying the types of perturbations and testing whether the approach holds up.\n\"We have exciting ideas on how to improve the sensitivity of this system by a large factor but it's going to take more work to get it implemented,\" said Bernien. \"This was a great starting place.\"\nEventually, Bernien imagines a system of spectator qubits could run constantly in the background of any neutral atom quantum computer and also quantum computers of other architectures, minimizing the error as the computer stores data and makes computations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tK.

   "text": "To overcome global energy challenges and fight the looming environmental crisis, researchers around the world investigate new materials for converting sunlight into electricity. Some of the most promising candidates for high-efficiency low-cost solar cell applications are based on lead halide perovskite (LHP) semiconductors.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite record-breaking solar cell prototypes, the microscopic origin of the surprisingly excellent optoelectronic performance of this material class is still not completely understood. Now, an international team of physicists and chemists from Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society, \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris, Columbia University in New York, and the Free University in Berlin demonstrated laser-driven control of fundamental motions of the LHP atomic lattice.\nBy applying a sudden electric field spike faster than a trillionth of a second (picosecond) in the form of a single light cycle of far-infrared Terahertz radiation, the investigators unveiled the ultrafast lattice response, which might contribute to a dynamic protection mechanism for electric charges. This precise control over the atomic twist motions will allow to create novel non-equilibrium material properties, potentially providing hints for designing the solar cell material of the future.\nThe investigated hybrid LHP solar cell materials consist of an inorganic crystal lattice, which acts as periodic cages for hosting organic molecules. The interplay of free electronic charges with this hybrid lattice and its impurities determines how much electricity can be extracted from the sun light's energy.\nUnderstanding this complicated interaction might be the key for a microscopic understanding of the outstanding optoelectronic performance of LHPs. Researchers from Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin and their international colleagues have now been able to isolate the lattice response to an electric field on timescales faster than 100 femtoseconds, that is one tenth of a trillionth of a second.\nThe electric field has been applied by an intense laser pulse containing only a single cycle of far-infrared, so-called Terahertz (THz), light. \"This THz field is so strong and so fast that it may mimic the local electric field of an excited charge carrier immediately after the absorption of a quantum of sunlight,\" explains Maximilian Frenzel, one of the main authors performing the experiments.\nBy this approach, the investigators observe a concerted motion of the crystal lattice, mainly consisting of back and forth tilting of the octahedral building blocks of the inorganic cage. These nonlinearly excited vibrations can lead to\u2014so far neglected\u2014higher order screening effects, contributing to an often discussed charge carrier protection mechanism.\n\"Moreover, the related tilting angle plays a dominating role in determining the fundamental material properties, such as the crystallographic phase or electronic bandgap,\" clarifies Dr. Sebastian Maehrlein, leader of the international research project. Thus, instead of static chemical tuning of material properties, ultrafast dynamic material design comes into reach: \"As we can now modulate these twist angles by a single THz light cycle,\" summarizes Dr. Maehrlein, \"in future we might be able to control material properties on demand or even discover novel exotic states of this emerging material class.\"\nBy assessing such dynamic states of matter, the researchers hope to contribute some hints for designing the energy materials of the future.\nThe research is published in the journal Science Advances.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMaximilian Frenzel et al, Nonlinear terahertz control of the lead halide perovskite lattice, Science Advances (2023).

He adds that the technique his team used at the time\u2014simple electro-optic modulation\u2014has technical limitations that allow for a maximal ten-fold change in the pulse duration.\n\"In our new publication, we present a converter that allows for up to a 200-fold change in the pulse duration, with an efficiency of 25 percent. This means that the resulting quantum Internet link could operate up to 50 times faster,\" Dr. Karpinski says.\nThe critical element of the new technique developed by researchers at the UW Faculty of Physics is a so-called time lens.\n\"A classical spatial lens, the kind we are normally familiar with, changes the size of a beam of light, either focusing it or diverging it. For example, light can be focused by using a convex lens\u2014one in which the thickness of the lens' glass decreases with increasing distance from its center. By a similar principle, a time lens can either shorten or lengthen light pulses, but here the effective optical thickness of the glass changes in time, not in space,\" explains Dr. Filip Sosnicki of the Quantum Photonics Laboratory, who was responsible for developing the experiment.\n\"To focus a wide beam of light using a spatial lens, it must be large enough. But this will make the lens highly convex, significantly increasing the amount, and therefore the weight, of the glass required to make it. To avoid this, we can use a Fresnel lens, whose specific shape reduces the thickness of such a lens to just a few millimeters or less,\" Dr. Sosnicki explains.\nDue to their much smaller thickness, Fresnel lenses are used in a variety of applications, including car headlights, lighthouses, railroad signals, and even smartphone cameras. \"In our research, we developed a temporal equivalent of such a lens, which we call a Fresnel time lens,\" Dr. Sosnicki goes on to note.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nStrong effect without destroying the lens \nTo create a time lens, the researchers took advantage of the electro-optic effect exhibited by some crystals. It allows the refractive index of a crystal (in this case, lithium niobate) to be altered, depending on changes in an external electric field applied to it. Using fast electric signals, it is possible to achieve a time-varying optical thickness of the crystal, which then implements the time lens.\n\"This effect has its limitations, as excessively high electric field can destroy the crystal. In the technique we developed, we increase the refractive index in stages, similar to a spatial Fresnel lens. This way, we achieve a strong effect without destroying the lens, which, in turn, allows for more extensive modifications of quantum light pulses,\" explains Dr. Karpinski.\nSuch \"staged\" operations require the use of ultrafast microwave electronics. \"For comparison\u2014high-speed Wi-Fi or 5G networks operate at frequency bands of about 3 to 5 GHz, whereas our signals are more than 7 times faster, with frequencies as high as 35 GHz,\" Dr. Sosnicki adds.\nIn further research, the scientists from the UW Faculty of Physics will test interfacing between different types of quantum information processing platforms and increase the photon transmission distance. \"So far, we have been transferring single photons between devices in one laboratory. Next, we will try to perform such transfers between different buildings and even cities,\" adds Dr. Michal Karpinski.\nThe work carried out by Dr. Michal Karpinski's group is an important step on the pathway toward creating quantum networks\u2014both small ones, which can be used in a single quantum computer, and vast ones, enabling quantum information transfer between quantum computers in different parts of the world, thus giving rise to the quantum Internet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFilip So\u015bnicki, Interface between picosecond and nanosecond quantum light pulses, Nature Photonics (2023).

However, accurately predicting these behaviors and making informed decisions relies on storing and tracking vast information from events in the distant past\u2014a process which presents huge challenges.\nCurrent models using artificial intelligence see their memory requirements increase by more than a hundredfold every two years and can often involve optimization over billions\u2014or even trillions\u2014of parameters. Such immense amounts of information lead to a bottleneck where we must trade-off memory cost against predictive accuracy.\nA collaborative team of researchers from The University of Manchester, the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), the Centre for Quantum Technologies (CQT) at the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) propose that quantum technologies could provide a way to mitigate this trade-off.\nThe team have successfully implemented quantum models that can simulate a family of complex processes with only a single qubit of memory\u2014the basic unit of quantum information\u2014offering substantially reduced memory requirements.\nUnlike classical models that rely on increasing memory capacity as more data from past events are added, these quantum models will only ever need one qubit of memory.\nThe development, published in the journal Nature Communications, represents a significant advancement in the application of quantum technologies in complex system modeling.\nDr. Thomas Elliott, project leader and Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw Fellow at The University of Manchester, said, \"Many proposals for quantum advantage focus on using quantum computers to calculate things faster. We take a complementary approach and instead look at how quantum computers can help us reduce the size of the memory we require for our calculations.\"\n\"One of the benefits of this approach is that by using as few qubits as possible for the memory, we get closer to what is practical with near-future quantum technologies. Moreover, we can use any extra qubits we free up to help mitigate against errors in our quantum simulators.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe project builds on an earlier theoretical proposal by Dr. Elliott and the Singapore team. To test the feasibility of the approach, they joined forces with USTC, who used a photon-based quantum simulator to implement the proposed quantum models.\nThe team achieved higher accuracy than is possible with any classical simulator equipped with the same amount of memory. The approach can be adapted to simulate other complex processes with different behaviors.\nDr. Wu Kang-Da, post-doctoral researcher at USTC and joint first author of the research, said, \"Quantum photonics represents one of the least error-prone architectures that has been proposed for quantum computing, particularly at smaller scales. Moreover, because we are configuring our quantum simulator to model a particular process, we are able to finely-tune our optical components and achieve smaller errors than typical of current universal quantum computers.\"\nDr. Chengran Yang, Research Fellow at CQT and also joint first author of the research, added, \"This is the first realization of a quantum stochastic simulator where the propagation of information through the memory over time is conclusively demonstrated, together with proof of greater accuracy than possible with any classical simulator of the same memory size.\"\nBeyond the immediate results, the scientists say that the research presents opportunities for further investigation, such as exploring the benefits of reduced heat dissipation in quantum modeling compared to classical models. Their work could also find potential applications in financial modeling, signal analysis and quantum-enhanced neural networks.\nNext steps include plans to explore these connections, and to scale their work to higher-dimensional quantum memories.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKang-Da Wu et al, Implementing quantum dimensionality reduction for non-Markovian stochastic simulation, Nature Communications (2023).

   "text": "A laser pulse hits an electron in a solid. If it receives enough energy from the light wave, it can then move freely through a solid. This phenomenon, which scientists have been exploring since the beginnings of quantum mechanics, is called photoinjection. There are still open questions about how the relevant processes unfold in time.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaser physicists of the attoworld team of LMU and the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics have now made a direct observation of how the optical properties of silicon and silicon dioxide evolve during the first few femtoseconds (millionths of a billionth of a second) after photoinjection with a strong laser pulse.\nThis physics of photoinjection is relatively simple when it comes to the photoelectric effect explained by Albert Einstein. Here, an electron absorbs a single photon that has enough energy to free the electron from a potential that constrains its motion. It gets more complicated when no photon in the light wave has enough energy to do so. In this case, bound electrons can become free by absorbing more than one photon at once or by quantum tunneling. These are nonlinear processes that are effective only when the electric field is strong, which means that only the central part of a laser pulse can drive them efficiently.\nNovel technique for scanning\nWith the tools of attosecond science, it is possible to produce most charge carriers within a single half-cycle of a light pulse, increasing the conductivity of a solid by orders of magnitude within just a few femtoseconds. The laser physicists of the attoworld team at LMU and the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics have investigated how quickly solids change their optical properties after ultrafast photoinjection. To do so, they sent two few-cycle pulses through a thin sample: an intense pump pulse that created charge carriers and a weak test pulse that interacted with them.\nBecause photoinjection was confined to a time interval shorter than half a cycle of the test field, it was possible to observe how charge carriers interacted with the test field during the first femtoseconds after their appearance. This information was encoded in the distortions that photoinjection imprinted on the time-dependent electric field of the test pulse. The scientists measured these distortions using a novel technique for optical-field sampling, and they repeated their measurements for many delays between the two pulses.\nThe innovative technique for optical-field-resolved pump-probe measurements now gives the attoworld team direct access to light-driven electric currents during and after photoinjection. \"The most important result is that we now know how to perform and analyze such experiments and that we indeed saw the light-driven electron motion as no one could do before,\" Vladislav Yakovlev, last author of the study published in Nature, says.\n\"We were surprised to see no clear signs of quasiparticle formation,\" Yakovlev explains further. \"This means that, in these particular measurements, the many-body physics measurements did not have much influence on how the conductivity of the medium built up after photoinjection, but we may see some fancier physics in the future.\"\nAll modern electronics are based on controlling the flow of charge carriers by rapidly increasing and decreasing their ability to move through circuits. The attoworld team's research is about reaching the ultimate speed limits of this control using light. The new findings could eventually help achieve future signal processing in the petahertz range, making so-called light wave electronics possible. That would speed up today's electronics by about 100,000 times.\n\"I would argue that we've just scratched the surface of what pump-probe field-resolved measurements can do. Equipped with our experience and insights, other researchers can now use our approach to answer their questions,\" Yakovlev says.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDmitry A.

   "text": "Atomic clocks are the world's most precise timekeepers. Based on periodic transitions between two electronic states of an atom, they can track the passage of time with a precision as high as one part in a quintillion, meaning that they won't lose or gain a second over 30 billion years\u2014more than twice the age of the universe.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a paper published on May 24 in Nature, an international team at CERN's nuclear physics facility, ISOLDE, reports a key step towards building a clock that would be based on a periodic transition between two states of an atomic nucleus\u2014the nucleus of an isotope of the element thorium, thorium-229.\nSuch a nuclear clock could be more precise than today's most precise atomic clocks, thanks to the different size and constituents of a nucleus compared to those of an atom. In addition, it could serve as a sensitive tool with which to search for new phenomena beyond the Standard Model, currently the best description there is of the subatomic world. For instance, it could allow researchers to look for variations over time of fundamental constants of nature and to search for ultralight dark matter.\nEver since 2003, when Ekkehard Peik and Christian Tamm proposed a nuclear clock based on the transition between the ground state of the thorium-229 nucleus and the first, higher-energy state (called an isomer), researchers have been racing to observe and characterize this nuclear transition.\nIn the two decades, researchers have measured with ever increasing precision the isomer's energy, the precise value of which is required to develop lasers to drive the transition to the isomer. However, despite much effort, they have not succeeded in observing the light emitted in the transition from the isomer to the ground state. This phenomenon, known in nuclear physicists' parlance as the radiative decay of the isomer, which has a relatively long lifetime, is a key ingredient in developing a nuclear clock, because it would allow, among other things, the isomer's energy to be determined with higher precision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: CERN\n\nA team working at ISOLDE has now achieved this feat by producing thorium-229 nuclei in the isomeric state in a novel way and investigating the nuclei using a technique called vacuum-ultraviolet spectroscopy. The wavelength of the observed light corresponds to an isomer's energy of 8.338 electronvolts (eV) with an uncertainty of 0.024 eV\u2014a value that is seven times more precise than the previous most precise measurements.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nSignificant to the team's success was the production of isomeric thorium-229 nuclei via the so-called beta decay of actinium-229 isotopes, which were made at ISOLDE and incorporated in calcium fluoride or magnesium fluoride crystals.\n\"ISOLDE is currently one of only two facilities in the world that can produce actinium-229 isotopes,\" says the main author of the paper, Sandro Kraemer. \"By incorporating these isotopes in calcium fluoride or magnesium fluoride crystals, we produced many more isomeric thorium-229 nuclei and increased our chances of observing their radiative decay.\"\nThe novel approach of producing thorium-229 nuclei also made it possible to determine the lifetime of the isomer in the magnesium fluoride crystal. Knowledge of this lifetime is needed to predict the precision of a thorium-229 nuclear clock based on this solid-state system. The long lifetime that was measured, namely 16.1 minutes with an uncertainty of 2.5 minutes, confirms theoretical estimates and indicates that a clock precision competitive with that of today's most precise atomic clocks is attainable.\n\"Solid-state systems such as magnesium fluoride crystals are one of two possible settings in which to build a future thorium-229 nuclear clock,\" says the team's spokesperson, Piet Van Duppen. \"Our study marks a crucial step in this direction, and it will facilitate the development of the lasers needed to drive the periodic transition that would make such a clock tick.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSandro Kraemer et al, Observation of the radiative decay of the 229Th nuclear clock isomer, Nature (2023).

   "text": "Scientists have conducted laboratory experiments at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) that provide new insights on the complex process of pressure-driven ionization in giant planets and stars. Their research, published today in Nature, unveils the material properties and behavior of matter under extreme compression, offering important implications for astrophysics and nuclear fusion research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you can recreate conditions that occur in a stellar object, then you can actually find out what's going on inside of it,\" said collaborator Siegfried Glenzer, director of the High Energy Density Division at the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. \"It's like putting a thermometer into the star and measuring how hot it is and what these conditions do to the atoms inside the material. It can teach us new ways to manipulate matter for fusion energy sources.\"\nThe international research team used the world's largest and most energetic laser, the National Ignition Facility (NIF), to generate the extreme conditions necessary for pressure-driven ionization. By employing 184 laser beams, the team heated the inside of a cavity, converting the laser energy into X-rays that heated a 2 mm diameter beryllium shell placed in the center. As the outside of the shell rapidly expanded due to the heating, the inside accelerated inwards reaching temperatures around two million kelvins and pressures up to three billion atmospheres, creating a tiny piece of matter, as found in dwarf stars, for a few nanoseconds in the laboratory.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Radiation hydrodynamic simulations.

DOI: 10.1038/s41586-023-05996-8\n             \n\n\nThe highly compressed beryllium sample, up to 30 times its ambient solid density, was probed with X-rays to figure out its density, temperature, and electron structure. The findings revealed that, following strong heating and compression, at least three out of four electrons in beryllium transitioned into conducting states. Additionally, the study uncovered unexpectedly weak elastic scattering, indicating reduced localization, or freeing up, of the remaining electron.\nMatter in the interior of giant planets and some relatively cool stars is highly compressed by the weight of the layers above. At such high pressures, generated by high compression, the proximity of atomic nuclei leads to interactions between electronic bound states of neighboring ions and ultimately to their complete ionization. While ionization in burning stars is primarily determined by temperature, pressure-driven ionization dominates in cooler objects.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nDespite its importance for the structure and evolution of celestial objects, pressure ionization as a pathway to highly ionized matter is not well understood theoretically. Moreover, the extreme states of matter required are very difficult to create and study in the laboratory, said LLNL physicist Tilo D\u00f6ppner, who led the project.\n\"By recreating extreme conditions similar to those inside giant planets and stars, we were able to observe changes in material properties and electron structure that are not captured by current models,\" D\u00f6ppner said. \"Our work opens new avenues for studying and modeling the behavior of matter under extreme compression. The ionization in dense plasmas is a key parameter as it affects the equation of state, thermodynamic properties, and radiation transport through opacity.\"\nThe research also has significant implications for inertial confinement fusion experiments at NIF, where X-ray absorption and compressibility are key parameters for optimizing high performance fusion experiments. A comprehensive understanding of pressure- and temperature-driven ionization is essential for modeling compressed materials and ultimately for developing an abundant, carbon-free energy source by means of laser-driven nuclear fusion, D\u00f6ppner said.\n\"The unique capabilities at the National Ignition Facility are unrivaled. There is only one place on Earth where we can create the extreme compressions of planetary cores and stellar interiors in the laboratory, and study and observe them, and that's on the world's largest and most energetic laser,\" said Bruce Remington, NIF Discovery Science program leader. \"Building on the foundation of previous research at NIF, this work is expanding the frontiers of laboratory astrophysics.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tT.

   "text": "Light can be absorbed or reflected at the surface of a material depending on the matter's properties or change its form and be converted into thermal energy. Upon reaching a metallic material's surface, light also tends to lose energy to the electrons inside the metal, a broad range of phenomena we call \"optical loss.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction of ultra-small optical elements that use light is difficult since the smaller the size of an optical component results in a greater optical loss. However, in recent years, the non-Hermitian theory, which uses optical loss in an entirely different way, has been applied to optics research. New findings in physics are being made by adopting non-Hermitian theory that embraces optical loss, exploring ways to make use of the phenomenon, unlike general physics, where optical loss is perceived as an imperfect component of an optical system. A \"blessing in disguise\" is that which initially seems to be a disaster but which ultimately results in good luck. This research story is a blessing in disguise in physics.\nProf. Junsuk Rho (Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Chemical Engineering) from POSTECH and Ph.D. candidates Heonyeong Jeon and Seokwoo Kim (Mechanical Engineering) from POSTECH, and Prof. Yongmin Liu of Northeastern University (NEU) in Boston and their joint research team were able to control the direction of light beams using non-Hermitian meta-grating systems.

Credit: POSTECH\n             \n\n\nWhen light is incident on a metal surface, the electrons in the metal oscillate collectively as a single body with the light wave. The phenomenon is called surface plasmon polariton or SPP. A \"grating coupler\" is widely used as an auxiliary device to control the directions of the SPPs. The efficiency of the device is limited in that it converts the right-angle incident light into SPPs in unintended directions.\nThe research team applied non-Hermitian theory to overcome the drawback. To start, the team calculated the theoretical exceptional point near which a certain optical loss occurs. Then, they validated its effectiveness through experiments using their specially designed non-Hermitian meta-grating coupler. The meta-grating coupler proved effective in providing unidirectional control of SSPs, which was nearly impossible with other grating couplers. They also could make light and SPP propagate in opposite directions by controlling the size and distance of meta-gratings. The research team was able to achieve the conversion of incident light into SSPs back to normal light using the same meta-grating device.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Observation of the interference pattern between the SPP propagating to the right and the SPP reflected by the metagrating. Due to the unidirectionality of the metagrating, the SPP does not transmit through the metagrid in the opposite direction. Credit: POSTECH\n             \n\n\nThe research findings can be useful in quantum sensor research in various areas, such as detection of antigens for disease diagnosis or harmful gases in the atmosphere, which, combined with engineering, could open the door to a wide range of applications.

   "text": "Magnetic materials with a triangular lattice have been the focus of numerous research studies, as theoretical predictions suggest that they could exhibit spin liquid states. These are quantum phases of matter that present interesting characteristics, such as quantum entanglement and fractionalized excitations.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there have been numerous experimental efforts aimed at observing these fascinating phases in materials with a triangular lattice, this has so far proved to be very challenging. A key reason for this is that weak spin-orbit coupling and other perturbations in these materials typically result in conventional spin freezing or magnetic states.\nResearchers at University of California, Boston College, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the National Institute of Standards and Technology were recently able to produce a quantum disordered ground state in the triangular lattice-magnet NaRuO2. Their findings, published in Nature Physics, suggest that this state was enabled by the cooperative interplay between spin-orbit coupling and correlation effects in the magnetic material.\n\"We have been studying triangular lattices for a long time, searching for materials that host what we call quantum disordered ground states,\" Stephen D. Wilson, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org. \"These are states where the magnetic moments on each atom, each sitting within a network of edge-sharing triangles, fail to order or freeze into place even at absolute zero. This failure to order is nominally due to quantum fluctuations which continuously scramble the moments and serve to define a new, intrinsically disordered and dynamic magnetic ground state.\"\nOne approach to realize quantum ground states in materials involves identifying effective strategies to entangle the orbital degree of freedom of individual electrons with their spin degree of freedom. This can ultimately be achieved by carefully combining different elements together, for instance including ruthenium (Ru) in compounds, which was also included in the team's NaRuO2 sample.\n\"A major challenge was to make the material we were interested in, NaRuO2, cleanly,\" Wilson explained. \"To really test what is going on in the realm of quantum magnetism, you really need to remove extrinsic factors like chemical impurities as much as possible. Once we had made NaruO2 with sufficient quality, there were several experiments we could perform, all of them uncovering a little bit more about the physics of what is going on. In other words, you need several different windows to form the whole picture of a complicated material.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nAfter they realized their clean NaRuO2 sample, Wilson and his colleagues thus proceeded to conduct a series of tests and experiments to better understand its underlying physics. They first examined it using basic bulk characterization methods, for instance measuring its magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity down to very low temperatures.\n\"We also conducted more advanced experiments like inelastic neutron scattering and muon spin relaxation measurements,\" Wilson said. \"All these probes tell us a little bit about what the magnetic moments in NaRuO2 do as you cool toward its ground state, each at different length and time scales. When the aggregate picture shows you that the magnetic moments fail to order and instead fluctuate as you cool to temperatures far below those where it should, then you can start to paint a picture of a quantum disordered ground state.\"\nThe experiments conducted by Wilson and his colleagues showed that their carefully designed NaRuO2 sample exhibited an inherently fluctuating magnetic ground state. At low temperatures, spin excitations in the material produced a metal-like term in its heat capacity and a series of continuous excitations in its neutron scattering, which resembled those associated with spin liquid states previously observed in magnets with a triangular lattice.\n\"Our work demonstrates that triangular lattices built from spin-orbit entangled transition metal ions (e.g., Ru) can be very interesting, and most importantly, the anisotropic interactions necessary to destabilize conventional magnetic order can be realized in real materials,\" Wilson said. \"We show that this can happen even in materials where the strength of magnetic exchange coupling is nominally pretty strong, which is the case in NaRuO2.\"\nRecent theoretical studies placed NaRuO2 is a strict ferromagnetic regime, meaning that the dominant interactions in the material should drive all the moments to point parallel to one another. While ferromagnetism would be fairly easy to detect, the findings gathered by Wilson and his colleagues suggest that it is not there, but rather that something else is going on inside this compound.\nIn the future, new studies could help to better understand the physics of this fascinating triangular lattice-magnet, potentially helping to solve this mystery. In addition, the recent work by this team of researchers could inspire new studies aimed at observing quantum spin liquid states in other magnets with a triangular lattice.\n\"Our next step will be to try and make single crystals of this material,\" Wilson added. \"We can gain a lot more information about the physics driving this unusual material once we can explore its inherent anisotropies and other experiments become possible once single crystals are attainable. The next big question is what type of quantum disordered magnetic state NaRuO2 forms\u2014one wants to ideally move beyond simply defining what the state isn't and instead start to paint as more precise experimental picture for what the magnetic ground state is.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrenden R.

   "text": "In a ground-breaking experiment, scientists from the University of Groningen, together with colleagues from the Dutch universities of Nijmegen and Twente and the Harbin Institute of Technology (China), have discovered the existence of a superconductive state that was first predicted in 2017.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey present evidence for a special variant of the FFLO superconductive state in the journal Nature. This discovery could have significant applications, particularly in the field of superconducting electronics.\nThe lead author of the paper is Professor Justin Ye, who heads the Device Physics of Complex Materials group at the University of Groningen. Ye and his team have been working on the Ising superconducting state. This is a special state that can resist magnetic fields that generally destroy superconductivity, and that was described by the team in 2015.\nIn 2019, they created a device comprising a double layer of molybdenum disulfide that could couple the Ising superconductivity states residing in the two layers. Interestingly, the device created by Ye and his team makes it possible to switch this protection on or off using an electric field, resulting in a superconducting transistor.\nThe coupled Ising superconductor device sheds light on a long-standing challenge in the field of superconductivity. In 1964, four scientists (Fulde, Ferrell, Larkin, and Ovchinnikov) predicted a special superconducting state that could exist under conditions of low temperature and strong magnetic field, referred to as the FFLO state.\nIn standard superconductivity, electrons travel in opposite directions as Cooper pairs. Since they travel at the same speed, these electrons have a total kinetic momentum of zero. However, in the FFLO state, there is a small speed difference between the electrons in the Cooper pairs, which means that there is a net kinetic momentum.\n\"This state is very elusive and there are only a handful of articles claiming its existence in normal superconductors,\" says Ye. \"However, none of these are conclusive.\" To create the FFLO state in a conventional superconductor, a strong magnetic field is needed. But the role played by the magnetic field needs careful tweaking.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nSimply put, for two roles to be played by the magnetic field, we need to use the Zeeman effect. This separates electrons in Cooper pairs based on the direction of their spins (a magnetic moment), but not on the orbital effect\u2014the other role that normally destroys superconductivity. \"It is a delicate negotiation between superconductivity and the external magnetic field,\" explains Ye.\nIsing superconductivity, which Ye and his collaborators introduced and published in the journal Science in 2015, suppresses the Zeeman effect. \"By filtering out the key ingredient that makes conventional FFLO possible, we provided ample space for the magnetic field to play its other role, namely the orbital effect,\" says Ye.\n\"What we have demonstrated in our paper is a clear fingerprint of the orbital effect-driven FFLO state in our Ising superconductor,\" explains Ye. \"This is an unconventional FFLO state, first described in theory in 2017.\" The FFLO state in conventional superconductors requires extremely low temperatures and a very strong magnetic field, which makes it difficult to create. However, in Ye's Ising superconductor, the state is reached with a weaker magnetic field and at higher temperatures.\nIn fact, Ye first observed signs of an FFLO state in his molybdenum disulfide superconducting device in 2019. \"At that time, we could not prove this, because the samples were not good enough,\" says Ye. However, his Ph.D. student Puhua Wan has since succeeded in producing samples of the material that fulfilled all the requirements to show that there is indeed a finite momentum in the Cooper pairs. \"The actual experiments took half a year, but the analysis of the results added another year,\" says Ye. Wan is the first author of the Nature paper.\nThis new superconducting state needs further investigation. Ye says, \"There is a lot to learn about it. For example, how does the kinetic momentum influence the physical parameters? Studying this state will provide new insights into superconductivity. And this may enable us to control this state in devices such as transistors. That is our next challenge.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJianting Ye, Orbital Fulde\u2013Ferrell\u2013Larkin\u2013Ovchinnikov state in an Ising superconductor, Nature (2023).

In the often-arcane world of quantum physics, this sort of self-organization of particles is seen in \"density waves,\" where particles arrange themselves into a regular, repeating pattern or order; like a group of people with different colored shirts on standing in a line but in a pattern where no two people with the same color shirt stand next to each other.\nDensity waves are observed in a variety of materials, including metals, insulators, and superconductors. However, studying them has been difficult, especially when this order (the patterns of particles in the wave) occurs with other types of organization such as superfluidity\u2014a property that allows particles to flow without resistance.\nIt's worth noting that superfluidity is not just a theoretical curiosity; it is of immense interest for developing materials with unique properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity, which could lead to more efficient energy transfer and storage, or for building quantum computers.\nTuning a Fermi gas with light\nTo explore this interplay, Brantut and his colleagues, the researchers created a \"unitary Fermi gas,\" a thin gas of lithium atoms cooled to extremely low temperatures, and where atoms collide with each other very often.\nThe researchers then placed this gas in an optical cavity, a device used to confine light in a small space for an extended period of time. Optical cavities are made of two facing mirrors that reflect incoming light back and forth between them thousands of times, allowing light particles, photons, to build up inside the cavity.\nIn the study, the researchers used the cavity to cause the particles in the Fermi gas to interact at long distance: a first atom would emit a photon that bounces onto the mirrors, which is then reabsorbed by second atom of the gas, regardless how far it is from the first. When enough photons are emitted and reabsorbed\u2014easily tuned in the experiment\u2014the atoms collectively organize into a density wave pattern.\n\"The combination of atoms colliding directly with each other in the Fermi gas, while simultaneously exchanging photons over long distance, is a new type of matter where the interactions are extreme,\" says Brantut. \"We hope what we will see there will improve our understanding of some of the most complex materials encountered in physics.\"\nOther contributors include the EPFL Center for Quantum Science and Engineering.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJean-Phillipe Brantut, Density-wave ordering in a unitary Fermi gas with photon-mediated interactions, Nature (2023).

   "text": "Scalable photonic quantum computing architectures require photonic processing devices. Such platforms rely on low-loss, high-speed, reconfigurable circuits and near-deterministic resource state generators. In a new report now published in Science Advances, Patrik Sund and a research team at the center of hybrid quantum networks at the University of Copenhagen, and the University of M\u00fcnster developed an integrated photonic platform with thin-film lithium niobate. The scientists integrated the platform with deterministic solid-state single photon sources using quantum dots in nanophotonic waveguides.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey processed the generated photons within low-loss circuits at speeds of several gigahertz and experimentally realized a variety of key photonic quantum information processing functionalities on high-speed circuits; with inherent key features to develop a four-mode universal photonic circuit. The results illustrate a promising direction in the development of scalable quantum technologies by merging integrated photonics with solid-state deterministic photon sources.\nAdvances in quantum technologies with integrated photonics\nQuantum technologies have progressively advanced in the past several years to enable quantum hardware to compete with and surpass the capabilities of classical supercomputers. However, it is challenging to regulate quantum systems at scale for a variety of practical applications and also to form fault-tolerant quantum technologies.\nPhotonics provide a promising platform to unlock scalable quantum hardware for long-range quantum networks with interconnections across multiple quantum devices and photonic circuits for quantum computing and simulation experiments. The high-quality photonic states and the fast, low-loss programmable circuits underlie the central idea of photonic quantum technologies to route and process applications. Researchers have recently developed solid-state quantum emitters such as quantum dots as near-ideal, high-efficiency sources of indistinguishable photons to realize on-demand single-photon sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Overview of the platform.

DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adg7268\n             \n\n\nPhotonic quantum information processing\nDuring this study, Sund and colleagues focused on single-crystal lithium niobate thin films bonded on a silica insulating substrate as a promising platform due to their strong electrical-optical properties, high transparency and high index contrast to form integrated circuits. Since the transparency range of the materials varied, they were well-suited to function with a variety of solid-state quantum emitters, with compatibility to function at cryogenic temperatures.\nIn this work, the team described the development of multimode lithium niobate on insulator circuits for quantum information processing at the single photon level for the first time. They accomplished this by using the circuits to regulate and facilitate the function of quantum states of light emitted from a quantum dot single-photon source. The team injected single photons emitted by a waveguide-integrated quantum dot source into the lithium niobate optical circuit to show key functionalities underlying photonic quantum information processing, such as multiphoton interference on a reconfigurable universal unitary circuit.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Photon processing in multimode high-speed integrated circuits.

Photons are directly coupled in and out of the chip using a fiber array, and their time of arrival is recorded via SNSPDs and a time tagger.

DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adg7268\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrated photonic platforms\nSund and colleagues illustrated the geometry used to realize single-mode lithium niobate on insulator waveguides. They implemented the optical circuits as rib waveguides via electron-beam lithography and argon etching on a lithium niobate film bonded on a silica-on-silicon substrate.\nAfter etching them, they clad the waveguides with a hydrogen silsesquioxane layer and optically coupled the photonic integrated circuits to single-mode fibers for improved coupling efficiency for an active approach to interface fast optical switches and circuits with optical fibers. The materials scientists and engineers realized the electro-optically tunable waveguide circuits with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer complete with directional couplers and an electrically tunable phase-shifter. The team tested the high-speed performance of the modulators to assess capabilities of the constructed photonic integrated circuits.\nOn-chip quantum interference\nDuring photonic quantum information processing, the researchers investigated the visibility of multiphoton quantum interference through on-chip Hong-Ou-Mandel experiments to test the performance of the platform for photonic quantum information processing. The materials scientists generated single photons by using a self-assembled indium arsenide quantum dot embedded in a photonic and electronic nanostructure.\nThe device contained a single-sided photonic crystal waveguide and a shallow-etched waveguide grating for efficient photon generation alongside a hetero-diode for electrical noise suppression and emission wavelength tuning. The scientists created a two-photon input state from a stream of single photons emitted by the quantum dot, while using an off-chip demultiplexer to separate pairs of consecutive photons, allowing simultaneous arrival of the photons at the chip. They then routed the photons towards single-photon detectors for coincidence detection.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Measurement of the waveguide propagation loss. a Optical microscope picture showing the set of spirals employed for estimating the propagation loss of LNOI waveguides. b Measured transmission of the four spirals plotted in a dB scale (blue squares).

DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adg7268\n             \n\n\nIntegrated single-photon router\nFast photon routers are significant in photonic quantum computing, where they can be installed with multiple modes for multiplexing schemes in near-deterministic functions. Sund and colleagues made use of deterministic quantum emitters by rotating streams of emitted photons for networking schemes to reduce costs in photonic quantum computing architectures.\nThe research team integrated fast phase shifters on lithium niobate platforms and displayed on-chip photon routers for quantum-dot emitted photons. The demultiplexer in the experimental setup contained three fast electro-optic Mach Zehnder interferometer switches cascaded in a tree-shaped matrix network. The entire experimental circuit showed the promising potential of lithium niobate on the insulator platform to route photons produced by quantum dots.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Schematics of full experimental setups. A. Schematic of the experimental setup used to perform measurements of two-photon interference in two-mode and four-mode interferometers. Optics: A pulsed laser operated at 72 MHz is used to drive a quantum dot (QD) single-photon source, producing a stream of single photons, which is routed into a two-mode demultiplexer consisting of an electro-optic modulator (EOM) and a polarizing beamsplitter (PBS). The demultiplexer splits subsequently emitted photons into two modes, one of which is delayed such that the photons are synchronized. The synchronized photons are subsequently sent to the chip via a fiber array (FA) and on-chip grating couplers, and extracted from different grating couplers and coupled to the same fiber array. The output photons are detected using superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) and the arrival times are recorded on a time-tagger (TT). Electronics: A fraction of the pulsed laser is split off using a beamsplitter and measured using a photodiode (PD). The resulting clock signal is used to trigger the EOM. A function generator (FG) is used to drive the modulators with an AC signal, and a synchronization signal is sent to the TT to allow for coincidence measurements between the control signal and single-photon detection events. B. Schematic of the experimental setup used to perform active 1 \u00d7 4 demultiplexing of a stream of single-photons produced by a quantum dot (QD) single-photon source. Optics: A pulsed laser operated at 72 MHz is used to drive a QD single-photon source, producing a stream of single photons. The stream of photons is routed directly into the chip via a fiber array (FA) and on-chip grating couplers, and output photons are extracted from different grating couplers with the same fiber array. These output photons are detected using superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) and the arrival times are recorded on a time-tagger (TT). Elecronics: A fraction of the pulsed laser is split off using a beamsplitter and measured using a photodiode (PD). Part of this clock signal is downsampled using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and used to trigger a square waveform with a repetition rate of \u223c5 MHz on an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG). This \u223c5 MHz signal is used to trigger a function generator (FG) which drives the modulators in an on-chip demultiplexer structure. A synchronization signal from the FG and the other part of the clock signal from the PD is sent into a time-tagger to enable coincidence detection between the input photon clock signal, the electronic control signal, and the single-photon detection events.

The team explored the possibilities of quantum dot\u2013lithium niobate on insulator platforms for this class of experiments and implemented an interferometer engineered from a network of six Mach Zehnder interferometers and ten phase modulators. The scientists then compared the measured distributions from experimental data with theoretical predictions.\nOutlook\nIn this way, Patrik Sund and colleagues displayed the promise of lithium niobate on insulator platforms to process photons from emerging solid-state deterministic sources. The platform can be further optimized for scalable quantum technologies.\nThe team propose using a cladding with a higher refractive index during the experiments for optimized outcomes. The high-speed lithium niobate on insulator quantum processors provide a route to scale up quantum photonic technologies beyond photonic nanostructures\u2014to achieve fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing at scale.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPatrik I.

GHZ states take this a step further by entangling three or more qubits. This increased complexity can be used to store more information, thus boosting precision and performance in applications such as quantum sensing and networking.\nSystems where qubits surround a central qubit that can be controlled provide a natural platform to prepare and utilize such states. For these experiments, the researchers used a single ytterbium ion qubit that can be controlled with lasers and on-chip electrodes surrounded by nuclear spins inside a crystal.\nSpecifically, the researchers utilized a highly localized ensemble of four deterministically and symmetrically positioned vanadium nuclear spins. They developed the control of these spins and demonstrated the ability to store and retrieve quantum information in the form of GHZ states.\nFurthermore, they leveraged the symmetry of their central spin system to intrinsically protect the stored quantum information from correlated magnetic field noise. This is a critical demonstration of resilience, necessary for real-world applications.\nTheir results demonstrate the possibility of harnessing complex nuclear-spin systems to enhance the functionality of quantum nodes.\nIn the future, the capability of this system will be improved by using additional ensembles of vanadium nuclear spins.

   "text": "The world's most sensitive model-independent experiment to search for particularly light particles, of which dark matter might be composed, starts today at DESY in the form of the 'light shining through a wall' experiment ALPS II. Scientific calculations predict that this ominous form of matter should occur five times as often in the universe as normal, visible matter. Until now, however, no one has been able to identify particles of this substance; the ALPS experiment could now furnish such evidence.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ALPS (Any Light Particle Search) experiment, which stretches a total length of 250 meters, is looking for a particularly light type of new elementary particle. Using twenty-four recycled superconducting magnets from the HERA accelerator, an intense laser beam, precision interferometry and highly sensitive detectors, the international research team wants to search for these so-called axions or axion-like particles.\nSuch particles are believed to react only extremely weakly with known kinds of matter, which means they cannot be detected in experiments using accelerators. ALPS is therefore resorting to an entirely different principle to detect them: in a strong magnetic field, photons\u2014i.e. particles of light\u2014could be transformed into these mysterious elementary particles and back into light again.\n\"The idea for an experiment like ALPS has been around for over 30 years. By using components and the infrastructure of the former HERA accelerator, together with state-of-the-art technologies, we are now able to realize ALPS II in an international collaboration for the first time,\" says Beate Heinemann, Director of Particle Physics at DESY.\nHelmut Dosch, Chairman of DESY's Board of Directors, adds, \"DESY has set itself the task of decoding matter in all its different forms. So ALPS II fits our research strategy perfectly, and perhaps it will push open the door to dark matter.\"\nThe ALPS team sends a high-intensity laser beam along a device called an optical resonator in a vacuum tube, approximately 120 meters in length, in which the beam is reflected backwards and forwards and which is enclosed by twelve HERA magnets arranged in a straight line. If a photon were to turn into an axion in the strong magnetic field, that axion could pass through the opaque wall at the end of the line of magnets.\nOnce through the wall, it would enter another magnetic track almost identical to the first. Here, the axion could then change back into a photon, which would be captured by the detector at the end. A second optical resonator is set up here to increase the probability of an axion turning back into a photon by a factor of 10,000.\nThis means, if light does arrive behind the wall, it must have been an axion in between. \"However, despite all our technical tricks, the probability of a photon turning into an axion and back again is very small,\" says DESY's Axel Lindner, project leader and spokesperson of the ALPS collaboration, \"like throwing 33 dice and them all coming up the same.\"\nIn order for the experiment to actually work, the researchers had to tweak all the different components of the apparatus to maximum performance. The light detector is so sensitive that it can detect a single photon per day. The precision of the system of mirrors for the light is also record-breaking: the distance between the mirrors must remain constant to within a fraction of an atomic diameter relative to the wavelength of the laser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron\n\nAnd the superconducting magnets, each nine meters long, generate a magnetic field of 5.3 Tesla in the vacuum tube, more than 100 000 times the strength of the Earth's magnetic field. The magnets were taken from the 6.3-kilometer-long proton ring of the HERA accelerator and upcycled for the ALPS project. The magnets were originally curved on the inside and had to be straightened for the experiment so that they could store more laser light; and the safety equipment for operating them under superconducting conditions at minus 269 degrees Celsius has been completely revised.\nThe ALPS experiment was originally proposed by DESY theoretician Andreas Ringwald, who also underpinned the theoretical motivation for the experiment with his calculations on extending the Standard Model. Ringwald says, \"Experimental and theoretical physicists worked together very closely for ALPS. The result is an experiment which has a unique potential to discover axions, which we might eventually even use to search for high-frequency gravitational waves.\"\nThe search for axions will initially begin in an attenuated operating mode, simplifying the search for \"background light\" that might falsely indicate the presence of axions. The experiment is due to achieve full sensitivity in the second half of 2023. The mirror system is to be upgraded in 2024, and an alternative light detector can also be installed at a later time.\nThe scientists expect to publish the first results from ALPS in 2024. Lindner is convinced, \"Even if we don't find any light particles with ALPS, the experiment will shift the exclusion limits for ultra-light particles by a factor of 1000.\"\nOverall, some 30 scientists have joined forces in the international ALPS collaboration. They come from seven research institutions: in addition to DESY, the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute), the Institute for Gravitational Physics at Leibniz University in Hanover, Cardiff University (UK), the University of Florida (Gainesville, Florida, U.S.), the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, the University of Hamburg and the University of Southern Denmark (Odense) are all involved.\nThe researchers are already making plans for the time after their current search for axions. For example, they want to use ALPS to find out whether a magnetic field influences the propagation of light in a vacuum, as predicted decades ago by Euler and Heisenberg. And the researchers also want to use the experimental setup to detect high-frequency gravitational waves.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are axions? \nAxions are hypothetical elementary particles. They are part of a physical mechanism postulated by the theoretical physicist Roberto Peccei and his colleague Helen Quinn in 1977 in order to solve a problem of the strong interaction\u2014one of the four fundamental forces of nature. In 1978, the theoretical physicists Frank Wilczek and Steven Weinberg linked a new particle to this Peccei-Quinn mechanism.\nSince this particle would \"clean up\" the theory, Wilczek named it \"axion\" after a detergent. A number of different extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics predict the existence of axions or axion-like particles. If they do exist, they would solve a whole series of problems currently puzzling physicists, including being candidates for the building blocks of dark matter. According to current calculations, this dark matter should be around five times as abundant in the universe as normal matter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDeutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWorld's most sensitive model-independent experiment starts searching for dark matter (2023, May 23)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tretrieved 15 June 2023\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom https://phys.org/news/2023-05-world-sensitive-model-independent-dark.html\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This document is subject to copyright.

   "text": "For generations, physicists were sure the laws of physics were perfectly symmetric. Until they weren't.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSymmetry is a tidy and attractive idea that falls apart in our untidy universe. Indeed, since the 1960s, some kind of broken symmetry has been required to explain why there is more matter than antimatter in the universe\u2014why, that is, that any of this exists at all.\nBut pinning down the source behind this existential symmetry violation, even finding proof of it, has been impossible.\nYet in a new paper published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, University of Florida astronomers have found the first evidence of this necessary violation of symmetry at the moment of creation. The UF scientists studied a whopping million trillion three-dimensional galactic quadruplets in the universe and discovered that the universe at one point preferred one set of shapes over their mirror images.\nThis idea, known as parity symmetry violation, points to an infinitesimal period in our universe's history when the laws of physics were different than they are today, with enormous consequences for how the universe evolved.\nThe finding, established with a high level of statistical confidence, has two primary consequences. First, this parity violation could only have imprinted itself on the future galaxies during a period of extreme inflation in the earliest moments of the universe, confirming a central component of the Big Bang theory of the origin of the cosmos.\nParity violation would also help answer perhaps the most crucial question in cosmology: Why is there something instead of nothing? That's because parity violation is required to explain why there is more matter than antimatter, an essential condition for galaxies, stars, planets and life to form in the way they have.\n\"I've always been interested in big questions about the universe. What is the beginning of the universe? What are the rules under which it evolves? Why is there something rather than nothing?\" said Zachary Slepian, a UF astronomy professor who supervised the new study. \"This work addresses those big questions.\"\nSlepian worked with UF postdoctoral researcher and the study's first author, Jiamin Hou, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory physicist Robert Cahn to conduct the analysis. The trio published their findings May 22 in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. The same researchers first proposed the idea of searching for parity violation using quadruplets of galaxies in a paper that was also recently published in Physical Review Letters.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nParity symmetry is the idea that physical laws shouldn't prefer one shape over its mirror image. Scientists usually use the language of \"handedness\" to describe this trait, because our left and right hands are mirror images we are all familiar with. There is no way to rotate your left hand in three dimensions to make it look like your right hand, which means they are always distinguishable from one another.\nParity violation would mean that the universe does have a preference for either left- or right-handed shapes. To discover the universe's handedness, Slepian's lab imagined all the possible combinations of four galaxies connected by imaginary lines in space. This makes for a 3D object called a tetrahedron, like a lopsided pyramid\u2014the simplest shape that has a mirror image. They defined right- and left-handed galactic tetrahedrons based on how galaxies were connected to their closest and farthest partners in these imaginary shapes.\nTheir method required analyzing a trillion imaginary tetrahedrons for each of a million galaxies, a mind-boggling number of combinations. \"Eventually we realized we needed new math,\" Slepian said.\nSo Slepian's team developed sophisticated mathematical formulas that allowed the immense calculations to be performed in a reasonable period. It still required a considerable amount of computational power. \"UF's unique technology we have here with the HiPerGator supercomputer allowed us to run the analysis thousands of times with different settings to test our result,\" he said.\nThe technical aspects of the analysis make it difficult to say whether the universe prefers \"right-handed\" or \"left-handed\" shapes, but the scientists saw clear evidence that the cosmos does have a preference. They established their finding with a degree of certainty known as seven sigma, a measure of how unlikely it is to achieve the result based on chance alone. In physics, a result with a sigma value of five or higher is typically considered reliable because the odds of a chance result at this level are vanishingly small. A similar analysis, conducted by a former Slepian lab member, identified the same universal shape preference, albeit with slightly less statistical confidence due to differences in the study design.\nAlthough the scientists are confident in this signal of parity violation, it remains possible that uncertainty in the underlying measurements could explain the asymmetry. Thankfully, much larger samples of galaxies from next-generation telescopes could provide enough data to erase these uncertainties in just a few years. Slepian's group at UF will perform their analysis on this new, more robust data as part of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument telescope team.\nThis is not the first time parity violation has been spotted, but it is the first evidence of parity violation that could affect the three-dimensional clustering of galaxies in of the universe. One of the fundamental forces, the weak force, also violates parity. But its reach is extremely limited, and it cannot influence the scale of galaxies. That galactic influence would require a parity violation to occur right at the moment of the Big Bang, a period known as inflation.\n\"Since parity violation can only be imprinted on the universe during inflation, if what we found is true, it provides smoking-gun evidence for inflation,\" Slepian said.\nNor could the weak force's parity violation explain the abundance of matter. In a symmetrical universe, the Big Bang should have created equal amounts of matter and antimatter, which would have annihilated one another and left the universe devoid of stars and planets. Since we clearly ended up with a universe made mostly of matter, physicists have long sought some sign of an asymmetry in early creation.\nThe findings by Slepian's lab can't yet explain how we ended up with this crucial abundance of matter. The \"how\" will require new physics going beyond the Standard Model, which explains our current universe. But the new results do strongly suggest that there was an asymmetry at the earliest moments of the Big Bang.\nNow the race is on for scientists to produce a theory that can explain the mirror-image preference of the universe and the excess of matter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJiamin Hou et al, Measurement of parity-odd modes in the large-scale 4-point correlation function of Sloan Digital Sky Survey Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey twelfth data release CMASS and LOWZ galaxies, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (2023).

   "text": "Recent technological advances have given us a remarkable ability to manipulate and control light waves, opening up numerous applications in various fields, such as optical communication, sensing, imaging, energy, and quantum computing. At the heart of this progress are photonic structures that can control light waves, either at the chip level in the form of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) or in free space as meta-optics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining these structures allows for the creation of compact optical systems. The PICs can be used to make subtle changes to the light wave, such as the manipulation of its phase and intensity to achieve a desired output, which can then be guided in free space by meta-optics. Such combined systems can control qubits for quantum computing and power light detection, as well as ranging systems like the ones used for autonomous vehicle navigation and mapping.\nSince PICs use nanometer-scale waveguides to confine and direct light, coupling their light to and from larger devices, such as optical fibers, is tricky. Grating couplers are commonly used for this purpose because of their grating structure that can diffract light going in or out of the PIC's waveguides. However, these devices can only shape the light wave to a certain degree, limiting their applicability.\nIn view of this shortcoming, meta-optics capable of manipulating optical wavefronts with arbitrary shapes have been suggested to couple light from PICs. Although this approach is promising, no multifunctional coupling between PIC and free space has yet been reported.\nNow, in a study published in Advanced Photonics Nexus, researchers from the University of Washington have demonstrated a chip-scale hybrid PIC/meta-optical platform consisting of a photonic integrated circuit with gratings below a separate meta-optics chip. The PIC comprises 16 identical gratings arranged in a two-dimensional array, each with an aperture size of 300 micrometers and coupled to an optical fiber with a grating coupler. These gratings serve as waveguides and direct light from the fiber to the meta-optics chip which shapes and outputs light to free space, parallel to the input light.\n\"Using an array of low-loss meta-optics, we have developed a flexible and interchangeable interface between a photonic integrated circuit and free space,\" says senior author Associate Professor Arka Majumdar from the University of Washington in Seattle.\nUsing this platform, the researchers were able to simultaneously pass light through 14 PIC gratings and then shape the corresponding beam with 14 different meta-optics, such as meta-lenses, vortex beam generators, extended depth of focus lenses, and holograms.\n\"Meta-optics has the ability to shape optical wavefronts to create a multifunctional interface between free-space optics and integrated photonics. This study exploits that. All the light beams that come out of the PIC are identical, but by placing different meta-optics on top of each grating, we were able to simultaneously manipulate the beams individually,\" explains Majumdar.\nIn their experiments with different meta-optics, the researchers found that the device operated with high accuracy and reliability, even without prior knowledge of the input light or the need for precise alignment between the two chips. Specifically, they achieved a diffraction limited spot of three micrometers and a holographic image with a peak signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10 decibels.\nThe remarkable feature of the proposed device is its ability to change its functionality simply by replacing the meta-optics linked to the PIC. This allows for a wide range of possibilities for controlling and modifying light beams with a high degree of error tolerance. The potential applications of this interface are manifold, and include beam steering, structured light generation, optical trapping, and manipulation of cold atom qubits.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQuentin A.

   "text": "Led by Kelly Chipps of the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, scientists working in the lab have produced a signature nuclear reaction that occurs on the surface of a neutron star gobbling mass from a companion star. Their achievement improves understanding of stellar processes generating diverse nuclear isotopes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Neutron stars are really fascinating from the points of view of both nuclear physics and astrophysics,\" said ORNL nuclear astrophysicist Kelly Chipps, who led a study published in Physical Review Letters. \"A deeper understanding of their dynamics may help reveal the cosmic recipes of elements in everything from people to planets.\"\nChipps heads the Jet Experiments in Nuclear Structure and Astrophysics, or JENSA, which has collaborators from nine institutions in three countries. The team uses a unique gas jet target system, which produces the world's highest-density helium jet for accelerator experiments, to understand nuclear reactions that proceed with the same physics on Earth as in outer space.\nThe process of nucleosynthesis creates new atomic nuclei. One element can turn into another when protons or neutrons are captured, exchanged or expelled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this animation, a powerful neutron star, at right, feeds off a companion star. Nuclear reactions on the surface of a neutron star can reignite, creating a complex mix of reactants. Credit: Jacquelyn DeMink/ORNL, U.S. Dept. of Energy\n\nA neutron star has an immense gravitational pull that can capture hydrogen and helium from a nearby star. The material amasses on the neutron star surface until it ignites in repeated explosions that create new chemical elements.\nMany nuclear reactions powering the explosions remain unstudied. Now, JENSA collaborators have produced one of these signature nuclear reactions in a lab at Michigan State University. It directly constrains the theoretical model typically used to predict element formation and improves understanding of the stellar dynamics that generate isotopes.\nBuilt at ORNL and now at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, a DOE Office of Science user facility that MSU operates, the JENSA system provides a target of lightweight gas that is dense, pure and localized within a couple millimeters. JENSA will also provide the primary target for the Separator for Capture Reactions, or SECAR, a detector system at FRIB that allows experimental nuclear astrophysicists to directly measure the reactions that power exploding stars. Co-author Michael Smith of ORNL and Chipps are members of SECAR's project team.\nFor the current experiment, the scientists struck a target of alpha particles (helium-4 nuclei) with a beam of argon-34. (The number after an isotope indicates its total number of protons and neutrons.) The result of that fusion produced calcium-38 nuclei, which have 20 protons and 18 neutrons. Because those nuclei were excited, they ejected protons and ended up as potassium-37 nuclei.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-resolution charged-particle detectors surrounding the gas jet precisely measured energies and angles of the proton reaction products. The measurement took advantage of detectors and electronics developed at ORNL under the leadership of nuclear physicist Steven Pain. Accounting for the conservation of energy and momentum, the physicists back-calculated to discover the dynamics of the reaction.\n\"Not only do we know how many reactions occurred, but also we know the specific energy that the final potassium-37nucleus ended up in, which is one of the components predicted by the theoretical model,\" Chipps said.\nThe lab experiment improves understanding of nuclear reactions that occur when material falls onto the surface of an important subset of neutron stars. These stars are born when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses into a sphere about as wide as a city such as Atlanta, Georgia. Then gravity squeezes fundamental particles as close together as they can get, creating the densest matter we can directly observe.\nOne teaspoon of neutron star would weigh as much as a mountain. Neutron-packed stars rotate faster than blender blades and make the universe's strongest magnets. They have solid crusts surrounding liquid cores containing material shaped like spaghetti or lasagna noodles, earning them the nickname \"nuclear pasta.\"\n\"Because neutron stars are so weird, they are a useful naturally occurring laboratory to test how neutron matter behaves under extreme conditions,\" Chipps said.\nAchieving that understanding takes teamwork. Astronomers observe the star and collect data. Theoreticians try to understand physics inside the star. Nuclear physicists measure nuclear reactions in the lab and test them against models and simulations. That analysis reduces large uncertainties resulting from a dearth of experimental data. \"When you put all of those things together, you really start to understand what's happening,\" Chipps said.\n\"Because the neutron star is superdense, its huge gravity can pull hydrogen and helium over from a companion star. As this material falls to the surface, the density and temperature grow so high that a thermonuclear explosion can occur that can propagate across the surface,\" Chipps said. Thermonuclear runaway transforms nuclei into heavier elements. \"The reaction sequence can produce dozens of elements.\"\nSurface explosions do not destroy the neutron star, which goes right back to what it was doing before: feeding off its companion and exploding. Repeated explosions pull crust material into the mix, creating a bizarre composition in which heavy elements formed during previous explosions react with lightweight hydrogen and helium.\nTheoretical models predict which elements form. Scientists typically analyze the reaction that the JENSA team measured using a statistical theoretical model called the Hauser-Feshbach formalism, which assumes that a continuum of excited energy levels of a nucleus can participate in a reaction. Other models instead assume that only a single energy level participates.\n\"We're testing the transition between the statistical model being valid or invalid,\" Chipps said. \"We want to understand where that transition happens. Because Hauser-Feshbach is a statistical formalism\u2014it relies on having a large number of energy levels so effects over each individual level are averaged out\u2014we're looking for where that assumption starts to break down. For nuclei like magnesium-22 and argon-34, there's an expectation that the nucleus doesn't have enough levels for this averaging approach to be valid. We wanted to test that.\"\nA question remained about whether the statistical model was valid for such reactions taking place in stars rather than earthly laboratories. \"Our result has shown that the statistical model is valid for this particular reaction, and that removes a tremendous uncertainty from our understanding of neutron stars,\" Chipps said. \"It means that we now have a better grasp of how those nuclear reactions are proceeding.\"\nNext, the researchers will try to improve the statistical model by further testing its limits. A past paper explored atomic mass 22, a magnesium nucleus, and found the model incorrect by almost a factor of 10. The current ORNL-led paper, probing 12 atomic mass units above this, found that the model correctly predicted reaction rates.\n\"Somewhere between [atomic] mass 20 and 30, this transition between where the statistical model is valid and where it's not valid is taking place,\" Chipps said. \"The next thing is to look for reactions in the middle of that range to see where this transition is occurring.\" Chipps and her JENSA collaborators have begun that endeavor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJ.

   "text": "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are chemicals emitted as gases that can have adverse health effects. They are often found in paints, pharmaceuticals, and refrigerants, among other common products, but they can also act as markers of explosives, insect infestation, food spoilage, and disease.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracing VOCs is important for public safety and all \"smell\" related issues. To this end, Liu and colleagues introduced a fluid mechanics-based chamber design for an electronic nose (e-nose) that consistently detects VOCs at low concentrations. The strategy, which includes using a shunt-like device to control the behavior of fluid flow, is a step forward in e-nose technology development. Their article \"Controlling fluidic behavior for ultrasensitive volatile sensing\" was published in Applied Physics Reviews on May 23, 2023.\nMethods for detecting VOCs face many challenges in terms of selectivity, sensitivity, reproducibility, and stability. E-noses, inspired by the olfactory system, can overcome some of these barriers by combining arrays of chemical sensors with pattern recognition techniques to recognize odors.\nHowever, many e-noses generate different signals toward VOCs of the same concentration when the sensor is located in different parts of the \"nose\" chamber.\n\"To counteract this problem, the fluidic behavior of the gas flow needs to be well controlled,\" said author Weiwei Wu. \"This ensures a uniform fluidic field and concentration of VOCs in the chamber and avoids generating any fake sensing characteristics.\"\nThe starting e-nose design featured a vertical chamber that looks much like a showerhead. This promotes vertical flow as gas spreads through holes at the bottom of the device and around to evenly distributed sensors.\nUsing fluid mechanics simulations, the team optimized the volume, symmetry, hole location, and sensor location of their e-nose chamber. They added a shunt-like device to promote fluid flow and shorten response time.\nBased on their simulation results, the researchers fabricated a Teflon chamber and measured the sensing performance of their e-nose. They compared two chambers, one with the shunt and one without. The chamber with the shunt device consistently performed around 1.3 times better at sensing an example VOC.\nIn the future, the authors plan to focus on minimizing the chamber and improving the structure further to decrease response and recovery time.\n\"E-nose research is a highly interdisciplinary field,\" said Wu. \"Chemists, physicists, biologists, electronics engineers, and data scientists need to work together to solve issues including effective sensing that considers the fundamental mechanisms of absorption/desorption, algorithms that achieve precise recognition of VOCs more quickly and with lower energy consumption, and how new technologies, such as memristors, should be involved.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tControlling fluidic behavior for ultrasensitive volatile sensing, Applied Physics Reviews (2023).

The study is published in the journal Physical Review Letters.\nQuantum networks connect quantum processors or quantum sensors with each other. This allows tap-proof communication and high-performance distributed sensor networks. Between network nodes, quantum information is exchanged by photons that travel through optical waveguides. Over long distances, however, the likelihood of photons being lost increases dramatically.\nAs quantum information cannot simply be copied and amplified, 25 years ago Hans Briegel, Wolfgang D\u00fcr, Ignacio Cirac and Peter Zoller, then all at the University of Innsbruck, provided the blueprints for a quantum repeater. These featured light-matter entanglement sources and memories to create entanglement in independent network links that are connected between them by a so-called entanglement swap to finally distribute entanglement over long distances.\nEven transmission over 800 kilometers possible\nQuantum physicists led by Ben Lanyon from the Department of Experimental Physics at the University of Innsbruck have now succeeded in building the core parts of a quantum repeater\u2014a fully functioning network node made with two single matter systems enabling entanglement creation with a photon at the standard frequency of the telecommunications network and entanglement swapping operations.\nThe repeater node consists of two calcium ions captured in an ion trap within an optical resonator as well as single photon conversion to the telecom wavelength. The scientists thus demonstrated the transfer of quantum information over a 50-kilometer-long optical fiber, with the quantum repeater placed exactly halfway between starting and end point.\nThe researchers were also able to calculate which improvements of this design would be necessary to make transmission over 800 kilometers possible, which would allow them to connect Innsbruck to Vienna.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tV.

   "text": "The soft, solid-like properties of colloidal gels are essential in fields such as food and medical applications, but how these properties manifest themselves is a long-standing mystery. Until now, it was believed that the solid nature of gels emerges through glass formation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a study recently published in Nature Physics, researchers from the Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo have used a new microscopic technique\u2014in situ confocal microscopy\u2014to reveal the differences in gel and glass formation.\nA colloidal liquid is a mixture consisting of small particles that are scattered throughout another liquid substance; milk is an example. Understanding how colloidal liquids can become a gel upon phase separation\u2014through a so-called dynamically arrested state\u2014is important for optimizing the design of foods, cosmetics, and biomedical materials. However, a single-particle-level explanation of the dynamically arrested state remains elusive.\nEfforts in this direction have recently focused on a principle known as local amorphous ordering, which pertains to the order of arrangement of the constituents of colloidal liquids. Nevertheless, there has not been an experimental means of visualizing such ordering, on a single-particle level, in the initial stage of colloidal gelation. Providing fundamental physical insights into the origin of amorphous ordering\u2014and thus the dynamically arrested state\u2014of colloidal gels is the problem that the researchers sought to address.\n\"A pentagonal bipyramid shape has a symmetry that is incompatible with crystallization, and might help prevent colloid particles from undergoing the gel-to-crystal transition,\" explains Hideyo Tsurusawa, lead author of the study. \"We developed an in situ confocal microscopy method for testing this hypothesis in a real-time, real-space manner.\"\nThe researchers report results on dilute colloidal gels consisting of \"sticky\" spherical particles that exhibited short-range, directionless, attractive interactions. They revealed that different local particle arrangements uniquely modulated the properties of the gel. Specifically, tetrahedra arrest local particle motion, 3-tetrahedra hinder crystallization, and pentagonal bipyramid clusters impart solidity. The researchers propose that minimizing the local potential energy is central to forming a gel state, whereas minimizing the free energy (entropy) is central to forming a glass state.\n\"The unique feature characterizing formation of a dilute gel is a sequential hierarchical ordering from tetrahedra to pentagonal bipyramids and to their clusters,\" says Hajime Tanaka, senior author. \"This is absent in glass formation.\"\nThis work proposed a novel mechanism based on sequential amorphous ordering for the dynamical arrest of colloidal gels, unlike the previous glass-based explanation, through directly accessing the gel formation process at a single-particle level.

   "text": "Did you know that wires can be used to ionize air to make a loudspeaker? Simply put, it's possible to generate sound by creating an electric field in a set of parallel wires, aka a plasma transducer, strong enough to ionize the air particles. The charged ions are then accelerated along the magnetic field lines, pushing the residual non-ionized air in a way to produce sound.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a loudspeaker can generate sound, it can also absorb it.\nWhile this plasma loudspeaker concept is not new, EPFL scientists went ahead and built a demonstration of the plasma transducer, with the aim to study noise reduction. They came up with a new concept, what they call the active \"plasmacoustic metalayer\" that can be controlled to cancel out noise. Their results are published in Nature Communications.\nThe scientists were intrigued by the idea of using plasma to reduce noise, since it gets rid of one of the most important aspects of conventional loudspeakers: the membrane. Loudspeakers equipped with membranes, like the ones in your car or at home, are some of the most studied solution for active noise reduction. It's active because the membrane can be controlled to cancel out different sounds, as opposed to a wall that does the job passively.\nThe problem with using the conventional loudspeaker as a sound absorber is that its membrane limits the frequency range of operation. For sound absorption, the membrane behaves mechanically, vibrating to cancel out the sound waves in the air. The fact that the membrane is relatively heavy, i.e. the inertia of the membrane, limits its ability to interact efficiently with fast changing sounds or at high frequencies.\n\"We wanted to reduce the effect of the membrane as much as possible, since it's heavy. But what can be as light as air? The air itself,\" explains Stanislav Sergeev, postdoc at EPFL's Acoustic Group and first author. \"We first ionize the thin layer of air between the electrodes that we call a plasmacoustic metalayer. The same air particles, now electrically charged, can instantaneously respond to external electrical field commands and effectively interact with sound vibrations in the air around the device to cancel them out.\"\nSergeev continues, \"As expected, the communication between the electrical control system of the plasma and the acoustic environment is much faster than with a membrane.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nNot only is the plasma efficient at high frequencies, but it is also versatile since it can be tuned to work at low frequencies as well. Indeed, the scientists show that the dynamics of thin layers of air plasma can be controlled to interact with sound over deep-subwavelength distances, to actively respond to noise and cancel it out over a broad bandwidth. The fact that their device is active is key, since passive noise reduction technologies are limited in the band of frequencies that can be controlled.\nThe plasma absorber is also more compact that most conventional solutions. Exploiting the unique physics of plasmacoustic metalayers, the scientists experimentally demonstrate perfect sound absorption: \"100% of the incoming sound intensity is absorbed by the metalayer and nothing is reflected back,\" says EPFL's Acoustic Group's senior scientist Herv\u00e9 Lissek. They also show tunable acoustic reflection from several Hz to the kHz range, with transparent plasma layers of thicknesses down to only a thousandth of a given wavelength, much smaller than conventional noise reduction solutions.\nTo give an idea of how much more compact the plasma absorber is, consider a low, audible sound frequency of 20 Hz, where the sonic wavelength is 17m meters long. The plasma layer would only need to be 17 mm thick to absorb the noise, whereas most conventional noise reduction solutions, like absorbing walls, would need to be at least 4 m thick which often limits its feasibility.\n\"The most fantastic aspect in this concept is that, unlike conventional sound absorbers relying on porous bulk materials or resonant structures, our concept is somehow ethereal. We have unveiled a completely new mechanism of sound absorption, that can be made as thin and light as possible, opening new frontiers in terms of noise control where space and weight matter, especially at low frequencies,\" says Herv\u00e9 Lissek.\nEPFL has partnered with Sonexos SA, a Swiss-based audio technology company, to develop cutting-edge active sound absorbers that use the plasmacoustic metalayer concept. Together, they aim to provide novel and efficient solutions for reducing noise in a wide range of applications, including the automotive, consumer, commercial, and industrial sectors.\n\"This strategic collaboration leverages EPFL's expertise in material science and acoustics, as well as Sonexos' proven track record in delivering high-performance audio solutions,\" explains Mark Donaldson, CEO and Founder of Sonexos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStanislav Sergeev et al, Ultrabroadband sound control with deep-subwavelength plasmacoustic metalayers, Nature Communications (2023).

Will the quantum computer of the future contain qubits that are based on superconducting transmon qubits, spin qubits in silicon, NV centers in diamond, or perhaps some other quantum phenomenon? Each type of qubit has their own advantages\u2014and disadvantages. One is more stable, the second has a higher fidelity, and others are more easily mass-produced. The perfect qubit does not exist. Yet.\nBest of both worlds\nIn this work, the researchers from QuTech\u2014a collaboration between the Delft University of Technology and TNO\u2014and together with international collaborators made a smart combination of existing techniques to store quantum information.\nMarta Pita-Vidal, co-first author explains, \"Two of the most promising types are spin qubits in semiconductors and transmon qubits in superconducting circuits. However, each type has its own challenges. For example, spin qubits are small and compatible with current industrial technology, but they struggle with interacting over long distances. On the other hand, transmon qubits can be controlled and read out efficiently over long distances, but they have a built-in speed limit for operations and are relatively large. The researchers in this study aim to harness the advantages of both types of qubits by developing a hybrid architecture that combines them.\"\nAndreev spin qubits\n\"In our experiment, we managed to directly manipulate the spin of the qubit using a microwave signal,\" says Arno Bargerbos, the other co-first author. \"We achieved very high 'Rabi frequencies,' which is a measure of how fast they can control the qubit. Next, they embedded this 'Andreev spin qubit' within a superconducting transmon qubit which enables fast measurement of the qubit state.\"\nThe researchers characterized the coherence time of the Andreev spin qubit, a measure of how long the qubit can stay alive. They observed that its \"longevity\" is affected by the magnetic field from the surrounding materials.\n\"Finally,\" says Bargerbos, \"we demonstrated the first direct strong coupling between a spin qubit and a superconducting qubit, meaning that they could get the two qubits to interact in a controlled way. This suggests that the Andreev spin qubit can become a key element to interconnect quantum processors based on radically different qubit technologies: semiconducting spin qubits and superconducting qubits.\"\nPrincipal investigator Christian Andersen says, \"The current Andreev spin qubit is not perfect yet. It still needs to demonstrate multi-qubit operations, which is needed for universal quantum computers. The coherence time is also sub-optimal. That can be improved by using another material. Fortunately, the scalability of the qubits is on par with semiconductor qubits, raising the hope that we can get to the point where making the quantum algorithms becomes the limiting factor and not the quantum hardware.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarta Pita-Vidal, Direct manipulation of a superconducting spin qubit strongly coupled to a transmon qubit, Nature Physics (2023).

Some can measure tiny variations in the gravitational field. This can, for example, be utilized in construction works for subsoil mapping before construction, or to predict earthquakes.

What started the hype, and is in some way still driving it, is an algorithm for quantum computers that Peter Shor, an American mathematician and professor at MIT, developed in 1994. Shor's algorithm makes it possible for a powerful quantum computer to break RSA encryption. This is the encryption that is widely used when we send data on the Internet.\nBut there is also a clear assumption that quantum computers will eventually be able to handle many other calculations that are impossible using an ordinary computer. Therefore, a huge market potential is predicted for quantum computers. In other words, there is a lot of money to be made for those who can realize the quantum computer.\nAnd the hype is also partly due to the quantum computer being so difficult to develop and to its exploitation of quantum phenomena that are incomprehensible to many. The fascination with the technology itself contributes to the hype.\nWhen will we have quantum computers?\nWe are still very far from having a fully developed quantum computer. It is still unclear which physical system will constitute the quantum bits that can be utilized quantum-mechanically inside the quantum computer. Some are testing photons, other atoms, or ions\u2014and yet others electrons in superconducting material. In some places, mechanical oscillations are used. Research and development is being conducted within all these platforms worldwide.\nCalculations show that it takes a quantum computer of 10\u201320 million quantum bits to break an RSA encryption. Right now, the largest quantum computer is in the region of 430 quantum bits. So there is still some way to go. So, at the risk of becoming a laughing stock for posterity, I would guess that it will take another 20 years before we have a quantum computer that meets these expectations.\nWill I get a quantum computer at home?\nI will answer this based on where the technology is today and what we think a quantum computer will be good at\u2014and with this in mind\u2014my guess would be that quantum computers will not be something we will have at home. It will be meant for very specific and large-scale calculations. It will not be a computer we can use to go on Facebook or watch YouTube videos.\nI would think that the quantum computer will have a role like HPC (high performance computing), which you can buy access to today if you need to perform large-scale calculations. But I could be completely wrong. Technology often develops completely differently than we predict, so we may all be walking around with a quantum computer in our pockets in 30 years.\nDo you need to be interested in quantum physics as a non-physicist?\nQuantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement are a highly fascinating part of nature that can cause wonder and inspire completely new thoughts in us as humans. Instead of racing through the world with blinkers on, it makes us stop up and recognize that there is much more to nature than what immediately meets the eye. It is like the firmament. We could basically be indifferent to black holes and \"dark matter,\" but I think that it is about fascination, general education, and being aware of what nature actually contains.\nRight now, we do not encounter the applications of quantum technology in our everyday lives. This means that when we talk about them, we have to talk about quantum phenomena. They challenge us, because we have no experience with, for example, superposition in our visible world, which is governed by conventional physics, where objects such as a chair can only be in one place in the room.\nBut I think that when we start using quantum technology, we will stop focusing on the underlying quantum phenomena. This is, in fact, the case with other technologies such as PCs and mobile phones. Most of us do not think about how they work. But we do know how to use them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTechnical University of Denmark\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQ&A: Why is there so much hype about the quantum computer?

   "text": "Chiral spin liquids are one of the most fascinating phases of matter ever imagined by physicists. These exotic liquids exhibit quasi-particles known as non-Abelian anyons that are neither bosons nor fermions, and whose manipulation could allow for the realization of a universal quantum computer. Despite intense efforts in condensed matter physics, discovering such a phase in nature remains an outstanding challenge at the forefront of modern research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom a theoretical point of view, chiral spin liquids emerge in a simple model that was imagined by Kitaev in 2006, and which allows researchers to reveal their properties using analytical tools. Remarkably, recent advances in the design of quantum simulators open a possible path for the first experimental realization of the original Kitaev model, hence suggesting that chiral spin liquids (including their exotic quasi-particles) can be studied and manipulated in a highly-controlled experimental environment.\nIn a new study published in PRX Quantum, BoYe Sun and Nathan Goldman (ULB, Brussels), Monika Aidelsburger (LMU, Munich), and Marin Bukov (MPI-PKS Dresden, Sofia University) propose a realistic implementation of the Kitaev model in quantum simulators.\nBased on a precise pulse sequence, their system is shown to host a chiral spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons. The authors describe practical methods to probe the striking properties of these exotic states. In particular, their methods unambiguously reveal the topological heat current that flows on the edge of the system: a hallmark signature of the non-Abelian anyons that emerge on the edge of chiral spin liquids.\nThis work paves the way for the quantum simulation of chiral spin liquids, offering an appealing alternative to their experimental investigation in quantum materials.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBo-Ye Sun et al, Engineering and Probing Non-Abelian Chiral Spin Liquids Using Periodically Driven Ultracold Atoms, PRX Quantum (2023).

They proposed a piecewise function model that couples a quadratic function and an exponential decay function to analyze and correct distance effect and developed an improved Poullain algorithm to analyze and correct the incidence angle effect.\nThe results were published in ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing and IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing.\nThey found that distance effect originates from the system itself, and all wavelengths have a unified distance effect function. Based on this, they proposed a piecewise function model that couples a quadratic function and an exponential decay function to analyze and correct distance effect.\nFor different types of vegetation leaf targets, they usually exhibit different incidence angle effects due to their different surface microscopic physical structures and internal biochemical parameters. This effect is closely related to the bidirectional reflection characteristics of the measured target species under hyperspectral LiDAR conditions.\nTherefore, the team pointed out that the more accurate expression of incidence angle effect of hyperspectral LiDAR should be \"the incidence angle effect of a certain target under hyperspectral LiDAR.\" They developed a new improved Poullain algorithm to correct the incidence angle effect of the target.\nCompared with the traditional Lambert cosine law based on the assumption of isotropic scattering and the original Poullain algorithm, this algorithm considers the heterogeneity of the target roughness factor and diffuse reflection coefficient under different incidence angles and wavelengths, which is more in line with the reflection characteristics of natural target echoes.\nThe results of different vegetation leaf experiments showed that the standard deviations of the correction results were reduced by 30% to 60%, compared with the echo intensity and reflectivity under the standard 0-degree incidence angle.\nThe algorithm provides an important theoretical basis and technical support for accurate inversion of 3D biochemical parameters of vegetation in the future.\nCurrently, the research team has completed the design and development of the second-generation hyperspectral LiDAR system with high-speed acquisition capability, which is undergoing performance testing and is expected to be put into use by the end of 2023.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJie Bai et al, A Novel Algorithm for Leaf Incidence Angle Effect Correction of Hyperspectral LiDAR, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (2021).

In addition, the model could help other engineers who must manage the mixing of fluids after a shock wave passes through, such as those designing supersonic jet engines, as well as physicists trying to understand supernovae.\n\"These vortex rings move outward from the collapsing star, populating the universe with the materials that will eventually become nebulae, planets and even new stars\u2014and inward during fusion implosions, disrupting the stability of the burning fusion fuel and reducing the efficiency of the reaction,\" said Michael Wadas, a doctoral candidate in mechanical engineering at U-M and corresponding author of the study.\n\"Our research, which elucidates how such vortex rings form, can help scientists understand some of the most extreme events in the universe and bring humanity one step closer to capturing the power of nuclear fusion as an energy source,\" he said.\nNuclear fusion pushes atoms together until they merge. This process releases several times more energy than breaking atoms apart, or fission, which powers today's nuclear plants. Researchers can create this reaction, merging forms of hydrogen into helium, but at present, much of the energy used in the process is wasted.\nPart of the problem is that the fuel can't be neatly compressed. Instabilities cause the formation of jets that penetrate into the hotspot, and the fuel spurts out between them\u2014Wadas compared it to trying to squish an orange with your hands, how juice would leak out between your fingers.\nVortex rings that form at the leading edge of these jets, the researchers have shown, are mathematically similar to smoke rings, the eddies behind jellyfish and the plasma rings that fly off the surface of a supernova.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most famous approach to fusion is a spherical array of lasers all pointing toward a spherical capsule of fuel. This is how experiments are set up at the National Ignition Facility, which has repeatedly broken records for energy output in recent years.\nThe energy from the lasers vaporizes the layer of material around the fuel\u2014a nearly perfect, lab-grown shell of diamond in the latest record-setter in December 2022. When that shell vaporizes, it drives the fuel inward as the carbon atoms fly outward. This generates a shockwave, which pushes the fuel so hard that the hydrogen fuses.\nWhile the spherical fuel pellets are some of the most perfectly round objects humans have ever made, each has a deliberate flaw: a fill tube, where the fuel enters. Like a straw stuck in that crushed orange, this is the most likely place for a vortex-ring-led jet to form when the compression starts, the researchers explained.\n\"Fusion experiments happen so fast that we really only have to delay the formation of the jet for a few nanoseconds,\" said Eric Johnsen, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at U-M, who supervised the study.\nThe study brought together the fluid mechanics expertise of Wadas and Johnsen as well as the nuclear and plasma physics knowledge in the lab of Carolyn Kuranz, an associate professor of nuclear engineering and radiological sciences.\n\"In high-energy-density physics, many studies point out these structures, but haven't clearly identified them as vortex rings,\" said Wadas.\nKnowing about the deep body of research into the structures seen in fusion experiments and astrophysical observations, Wadas and Johnsen were able to draw on and extend that existing knowledge rather than trying to describe them as completely new features.\nJohnsen is particularly interested in the possibility that vortex rings could help drive the mixing between heavy elements and lighter elements when stars explode, as some mixing process must have occurred to produce the composition of planets like Earth.\nThe model can also help researchers understand the limits of the energy that a vortex ring can carry, and how much fluid can be pushed before the flow becomes turbulent and harder to model as a result. In ongoing work, the team is validating the vortex ring model with experiments.\nThe research is published in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichael J.

   "text": "An international team of researchers including scientists from FAU has, for the first time, used X-rays for an imaging technique that exploits a particular quantum characteristic of light. In their article, which has now been published in the journal Physical Review Letters, the researchers detail how this process could be used for imaging non-crystallized macromolecules.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research team used the extremely short and very intensive X-ray pulses at the X-ray laser European EXFEL in Hamburg in order to generate fluorescence photons that arrived almost simultaneously at the detector\u2014in a time window of less than one femtosecond (one quadrillionth of a second). By calculating the photon-photon correlations in the fluorescence of the illuminated copper atoms, it was possible to create an image of the light source.\nOn the atomic scale, the structures of materials and macromolecules are usually determined using X-ray crystallography. While this technique relies on coherent X-ray diffraction, the scattering of X-ray light can cause incoherent processes such as fluorescence emissions, which can dominate, even though they do not make a useful contribution to the diffraction measurement. Instead, they add a functionless haze or background to the measurement data.\nAs long ago as the 1950s, two British astronomers proved that it is possible to gain structural information from such self-luminous light sources, in their case it was the light from stars. Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Twiss, whose method is known as intensity interferometry, opened a new door to the understanding of light and founded the field of quantum optics.\nRecently, scientists from FAU, the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter and the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) suggested that intensity interferometry could be adapted for atomic-resolution imaging using X-ray fluorescence. The challenge in extending this idea to X-rays is that the coherence time of the photons, which dictates the time interval available to perform photon\u2013photon correlations, is extremely short. It is determined by the radiative decay time of the excited atom, which is about 0.6 femtoseconds for copper atoms.\nTogether with scientists from Uppsala University and the European XFEL, the group has now overcome that challenge by using femtosecond-duration XFEL pulses from that facility to initiate X-ray fluorescence photons within the coherence time. The team generated a source consisting of two fluorescing spots in a foil of copper and measured the fluorescence on a million-pixel detector placed eight meters away.\nOnly about 5,000 photons were detected on each illumination pulse, and the cumulative sum over 58 million pulses produced just a featureless uniform distribution. However, when the researchers instead summed photon-photon correlations across all images from the detector, a striped pattern emerged, which was analyzed like a coherent wave field to reconstruct an image of the fluorescent source, consisting of two well-separated spots of light.\nThe scientists now hope to combine this new method with conventional X-ray diffraction to image single molecules. Element-specific fluorescent light could expose substructures that are specific to certain atoms and even to certain chemical states. This could contribute to a better understanding of the functions of important enzymes such as those involved in photosynthesis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFabian Trost et al, Imaging via Correlation of X-Ray Fluorescence Photons, Physical Review Letters (2023).

In a new study published in Science Advances, Chien-Hua Tu and a research team at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Germany and the University of Ioannina Greece confined crystals within nanoscopic cylindrical pores to show the flowing nature of semicrystalline polymers below their melting point, alongside an intermediate state of viscosity to the melt and crystal states.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe capillary process was strong during the phenomenon and dragged the polymer chains into the pores without melting the crystal. The unexpected improvement in flow facilitated polymer processing conditions applicable to low temperatures, suited for use in organic electronics.\nCrystalline state\nAbout 2,500 years ago, the philosopher Heraclitus proposed that \"everything flows,\" and while perfect crystals at zero temperature do not flow, crystalline materials do flow under specific conditions. For example, existing research from about 100 years ago showed that the flow of cast iron in the form of flowing metal grains surrounded by a thin amorphous layer is analogous to an undercooled liquid.\nUsing molecular dynamics simulations, researchers have confirmed the ideas to further suggest the significance of the complex grain boundary \"fluid\" on plastic deformation. For instance, the inner core of the Earth is similarly proposed to retain iron in a crystalline state. Furthermore, the core of planets such as Neptune and Uranus are composed of superionic crystalline water, and flow to generate their magnetic field, which may have ultimately led to our own existence.\nCrystalline materials that exhibit fluid-like mobilities are known as \"superionics\" and are important for energy applications. Semicrystalline polymers are solids that do not flow under normal conditions. In this work, Tu and colleagues showed how even the semicrystalline polymers underwent flow. To examine the phenomenon, they used two semicrystalline polymers; poly (ethylene oxide) and poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) with specific molecular characteristics. The materials scientists developed self-ordered nanoporous alumina templates for the study, based on existing literature protocols.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Imbibition of PEO8k in nanopores revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adg8865\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials characterization \nThe scientists examined the thermodynamics, structural and rheological properties of bulk polyethylene oxide materials. And the data confirmed the material film on the alumina template to be in a semicrystalline state. The team observed the domain spacing organization of crystalline lamellae with small-angle X-ray scattering. They used polarizing optical microscopy to study the superstructure of bulk polyethylene oxide with a film slowly cooled from melt to ambient temperature. The outcomes indicated a single spherulitic superstructure for polyethylene oxide, while the structural dynamics of poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) synthesized with a catalyst differed.\nThe research team carried out a 28-day imbibition (uptake of water that leads to swelling of materials) of the two polymer materials within anodic aluminum oxide templates and observed the samples with scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy to characterize them. In contrast to the relatively smooth appearance of polyethylene oxide, the poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) materials showed abundant grain structures due to diverse morphological origins in intracrystalline diffusion. After studying the surface appearances of materials, the researchers performed nano-infrared microscopy to obtain additional images of the surface topography of the two materials. The outcomes clearly showed the semicrystalline nature of polyethylene oxide. They also addressed the possibility of the capillary force in the experimental setup to be sufficiently high to melt the crystals during flow and noted the viscosity of semicrystalline polymers to be reduced during the experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Nano\u2013infrared (IR) reveals the semicrystalline nature of the polymer in the nanopores. (A) Schematic arrangement of the sample for the nano-IR measurements. After scanning the edge of the anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) surface, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip is positioned on the polymer or on the AAO surface. Then, the wavelength of the IR laser is tuned. The vibrational amplitude of the AFM tip corresponds to the nano-IR response of the selected position, respectively. (B) Topographic image of the AAO nanoporous sample filled by PEO8k. We selected three positions on the PEO (#1, #2, and #3) and three positions on the AAO (#4, #5, and #6), respectively, and recorded IR spectra. (C) Corresponding IR spectra taken at the marked positions in (B). For positions #1 to #3, absorption peaks at 1061, 1108, and 1149 cm\u22121 are present (in yellow) that are absent for positions #4 to #6. Peaks at 1061, 1108, and 1149 cm\u22121 are typical for semicrystalline PEO. Credit: Science Advances (2023).  DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adg8865\n             \n\n\nMechanisms of imbibition \nThe mechanisms of fluid uptake and materials swelling known as imbibition from the semicrystalline state relied on the dynamics of its crystalline and amorphous domains. Four processes acted on the amorphous and crystalline regions; segmental relaxation governed the dynamics in the amorphous domain, whereas three other processes affected the crystalline domain to demonstrate intracrystalline chain diffusion for crystal-mobile polymers such as polyethylene oxide.\nSince the imbibition of crystals also involved the diffusion of entire crystallites, Tu and the team examined the influence of the molar mass of the polymers on the process of imbibition. The outcomes showed that the molar mass regulated the imbibition speed.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Molecular mechanism and associated time scales during imbibition of semicrystalline polymers in nanopores.(A and B) Hierarchical structures and associated kinetics pertinent to semicrystalline polymers: (A) Organization of polymer chains into ordered lamellae involves the movement of segments within the crystalline (dc) and amorphous (d\u03b1) regions. Four processes are defined as follows: \u03c4stem represents the diffusion time of PEO chains in the length scale of the crystalline domain (dc); \u03c4lc illustrates the growth time of a unit crystal lamellae; <\u03c4c> depicts the switching time of two helical defect jumps within the crystal; \u03c4segmental represents the segmental dynamics within the amorphous regions. l represents the intermolecular distance (l = <a + b>/2; a and b are the crystal unit cell parameters along x and y axes, respectively). (B) Imbibition of polymer chains (\u03c4imbibition) proceeds via adsorption with a characteristic time \u03c4adsorption. The anchored units on the pore walls are indicated with the red color. (C) Characteristic time scales and their temperature dependence: \u03c4imbibition (yellow sphere), \u03c4adsorption (red dashed line), \u03c4lc (blue spheres), \u03c4stem (cyan spheres), <\u03c4c > (orange spheres), and \u03c4segmental (green crosses). The original data are provided in table S1. (D) The effect of lamellar orientation with respect to the pore axes on the variable penetration lengths.

DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adg8865\n             \n\n\nOutlook\nIn this way, Chien-Hua Tu and colleagues used several imaging methods in materials science, such as scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and nano-infrared results to examine how semicrystalline polymers underwent flow within nanopores made of anodic aluminum oxide via capillary action. They measured the viscoelastic behavior of the polymers with a shear rheometer, and the capillary action appeared to drive the polymer adsorption process.\nWhile successful imbibition was a relatively slow process, the capillary force was strong enough to drag polymer crystallites into the nanopores without melting the crystals. The unexpected increase in flow while preserving the polymer crystallites applied to polymer processing at low temperatures. Such phenomenon can lead to cold flow and subsequent bonding of polymers to ceramics or metal under specific conditions to prevent polymer degradation. Such semicrystalline polymers and ferroelectric materials have a variety of applications in organic electronics to affect their electronic and physical properties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChien-Hua Tu et al, When crystals flow, Science Advances (2023).

   "text": "When most people think of crystals, they picture suncatchers that act as rainbow prisms or the semi-transparent stones that some believe hold healing powers. However, to scientists and engineers, crystals are a form of materials in which their constituents\u2014atoms, molecules, or nanoparticles\u2014are arranged regularly in space. In other words, crystals are defined by the regular arrangement of their constituents. Common examples are diamonds, table salt, or sugar cubes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, in research just published in Soft Matter, a team led by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Sangwoo Lee, associate professor in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, discovered that crystal structures are not necessarily always regularly arranged. The discovery advances the field of materials science and has unrealized implications for the materials used for semiconductors, solar panels, and electric vehicle technologies.\nOne of the most common and important classes of crystal structures is the close-packed structures of regular spheres constructed by stacking layers of spheres in a honeycomb arrangement. There are many ways to stack the layers to construct close-packed structures, and how nature selects specific stacking is an important question in materials and physics research. In the close-packing construction, there is a very unusual structure with irregularly spaced constituents known as the random stacking of two-dimensional hexagonal layers (RHCP). This structure was first observed from cobalt metal in 1942, but it has been regarded as a transitional and energetically unpreferred state.\nLee's research group collected X-ray scattering data from soft model nanoparticles made of polymers and realized that the scattering data contains important results about RHCP but is very complicated. Then, Patrick Underhill, professor in Rensselaer's Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, enabled the analysis of the scattering data using the supercomputer system, Artificial Intelligence Multiprocessing Optimized System (AiMOS), at the Center for Computational Innovations.\n\"What we found is that the RHCP structure is, very likely, a stable structure, and this is the reason that RHCP has been widely observed in many materials and naturally occurring crystal systems,\" said Lee. \"This finding challenges the classical definition of crystals.\"\nThe study provides insights into the phenomenon known as polytypism, which enables the formation of RHCP and other close-packed structures. A representative material with polytypism is silicon carbide, widely used for high-voltage electronics in electric vehicles and as hard materials for body armor. Lee's team's findings indicate that those polytypic materials may have continuous structural transitions, including the non-classical random arrangements with new useful properties.\n\"The problem of how soft particles pack seems straightforward, but even the most basic questions are challenging to answer,\" said Kevin Dorfman of the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, who is unaffiliated with this research. \"This paper provides compelling evidence for a continuous transition between face-centered cubic (FCC) and hexagonal close-packed (HCP) lattices, which implies a stable random hexagonal close-packed phase between them, and thus makes an important breakthrough in materials science.\"\n\"I am particularly pleased with this discovery, which shows the power of advanced computation to make an important breakthrough in materials science by decoding the molecular level structures in soft materials,\" said Shekhar Garde, dean of Rensselaer's School of Engineering. \"Lee and Underhill's work at Rensselaer also promises to open up opportunities for many technological applications for these new materials.\"\nLee and Underhill were joined in research by Rensselaer's Juhong Ahn, Liwen Chen of the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, and Guillaume Freychet and Mikhail Zhernenkov of Brookhaven National Laboratory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJuhong Ahn et al, Continuous transition of colloidal crystals through stable random orders, Soft Matter (2023).

   "text": "High power/energy ultrafast fiber lasers have broadband applications in material processing, medicine, advanced manufacturing and other fields. Compared with solid-state lasers, fiber lasers have the advantages of compact systems, flexibility, good heat dissipation and high beam quality.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, due to the serious nonlinear effect inside the fiber, the single-pulse energy and average power of the ultrafast fiber lasers, especially those with all-fiber structures, still lag behind that of the solid-state lasers. In recent years, the Mamyshev oscillator has attracted much research attention thanks to its potential in producing high energy ultrafast pulses.\nRecently, a research group from National University of Defense Technology reported a Mamyshev oscillator based on all-polarization-maintaining fiber with core/cladding diameter of 10/125 \u03bcm, and realized a 153 nJ single pulse energy with a compressed pulse width of 73 fs. Furthermore, through adjusting the cavity parameters, a maximum 5th order harmonic mode-locking operation was obtained with an output average power of 3.4 W and a compressed pulse width of 100 fs.\nRecently their work entitled \"All-PM Fiber Mamyshev Oscillator Delivers Hundred-Nanojoule and Multi-Watt Sub-100 fs Pulses\" was published on Ultrafast Science.\nThe pulse energy and average power of ultrafast fiber lasers have been greatly improved in recent years based on the Mamyshev oscillator with cascade spectral broadening and offset spectral filtering effect. The continuous light and weak pulses will be blocked in the Mamyshev oscillator. Due to the sufficient spectral broadening, the strong pulse can be survived in the cavity after two filters with different central wavelengths, and the ultrafast laser with large pulse energy can be obtained.\nHowever, most of the previous results adopted spatial structures and introduced a large number of free-space elements for signal collimation and coupling, which render the system cumbersome and susceptible to interference.\n\"Our aim is to realize high power/energy ultrafast fiber lasers with all-fiber structure,\" explained A/Prof. Can Li. In the Ultrafast Science paper, a Mamyshev oscillator based on all-polarization-maintaining fiber with core/cladding diameter of 10/125 \u03bcm was reported.\nCompared with the conventional Mamyshev oscillators, which generally consist of two stages of gain fiber amplification, there is only a single amplification arm in the proposed laser. A piece of passive fiber was used to broaden the optical spectrum in the other arm, alleviating the nonlinear phase accumulation inside the cavity and making the system more compact in the meantime.\nThis research group respectively realized the high performance ultrafast fiber lasers with single pulse energy of 153 nJ and average power of 3.4 W, which represent the highest records in pulse energy and average power obtained from an all-fiber ultrafast laser oscillator with picosecond/femtosecond pulse duration.\n\"By adopting the fiber with larger core diameter and new pulse evolution mechanism that has a higher tolerance of nonlinearity phase accumulation, all-fiber ultrafast lasers with higher power/pulse energy are expectable,\" says Professor Pu Zhou.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTao Wang et al, All-PM Fiber Mamyshev Oscillator Delivers Hundred-Nanojoule and Multi-Watt Sub-100 fs Pulses, Ultrafast Science (2023).

That accomplishment comes down to two things: improvements in the detector design and the location of the experiment itself, Partridge said.\n\"It's been a lot of fun,\" Partridge said. \"We've learned a lot of new things, and we've built some really interesting technology,\" including flexible superconducting cables, electronics systems that function in extreme cold, and improved cryogenics systems\u2014along with advances in shielding the detectors\u2014that have made the detectors and surrounding systems better able to sense passing dark matter than ever before.\nThe experiment will also benefit from its new location 1.25 miles underground at SNOLAB, where the background of cosmic rays will interfere less with efforts to find a dark matter signal.\n\"SNOLAB and SuperCDMS are made for each other,\" said SNOLAB Executive Director Jodi Cooley. \"We are extremely excited about the potential for SuperCDMS to detect dark matter directly and advance our insight into the nature of the universe.\"\nVitaly Yakimenko, SLAC's deputy director for projects and infrastructure and SuperCDMS project director, said researchers look forward to bringing the experiment online. \"It's been 10 years of technological development to build these state-of-the-art detectors,\" he said. The team hopes the experiment will capture signs of illusive dark matter particles, but regardless of the outcome, it will establish a path forward for even more sensitive experiments, Yakimenko said. \"It's a major accomplishment.\"\nJoAnne Hewett, head of SLAC's Fundamental Physics Directorate and the lab's chief research officer, said she was pleased by the experiment's progress. \"Understanding dark matter is one of the most important areas of research, both around the world and here at SLAC,\" Hewett said. \"We're excited to reach this milestone and to work with our partners to build this cutting-edge experiment.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nSearching deep underground\nScientists know that all the visible matter in the universe\u2014all the dust and planets and stars that we can already detect through telescopes\u2014makes up only about 15% of what's actually out there. The rest is dark matter, but no one knows exactly what that is. Physicists can tell it's there through its gravitational pull on ordinary matter, but it is otherwise very hard to detect.\nThat's where experiments like SuperCDMS SNOLAB come in. The project is the latest iteration of a series of experiments that use silicon and germanium crystals to try to find dark matter particles. These crystals are cooled to a fraction of a degree above absolute zero\u2014hence the experiments' name: Cryogenic Dark Matter Search, or CDMS. The hope is that at such low temperatures, researchers could detect passing dark matter particles by the tiny vibrations they create when colliding with the crystals.\nThose collisions would also produce pairs of electrons and electron deficiencies, or holes, that move through the crystals, triggering more vibrations and amplifying the dark matter signal. Sophisticated superconducting electronics help detect these signals.\nTo make that job possible, the experiment will be built and operated at SNOLAB, 6,800 feet underground inside a nickel mine near Sudbury, Ontario. There, the SLAC-built detectors will be shielded from high-energy particles, called cosmic radiation, which can create unwanted background signals.\nA long journey\nOnce the detectors were done, the next step for the SLAC team was getting them to SNOLAB\u2014and here there were tradeoffs. To protect them from cosmic rays, the team wanted to get them to their new underground home as quickly as possible, which might suggest a direct route over the Rocky Mountains or even a flight to Ontario. However, the thinner atmosphere at higher altitudes affords less protection from cosmic rays.\n\"In principle, we want to keep things as low as possible, but there's also a cost to the total number of days you're on the surface,\" said Tarek Saab, a University of Florida physicist and SuperCDMS spokesperson. \"So, we want a route that gives you the least overall exposure to cosmic rays.\"\nIn the end, the team decided to take a route east to Texas and then north to SNOLAB.\nMeanwhile, SNOLAB has been busy getting the SuperCDMS facility ready for the detectors, the first two of which arrived on May 12 and made the trip 6,800 feet underground the following day. The remaining towers will arrive later this year, and initial preparations for the experiment are expected to be complete sometime in 2024, at which point the experimental team can begin taking initial data and working out any kinks that remain in the system. Researchers expect to run the experiment for three to four years before they have enough data to push the limits of what we know about dark matter.\nBut for now, everyone is looking forward to delivering the detectors, Saab said. \"It will be a significant milestone to have the detectors at SNOLAB.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSLAC National Accelerator Laboratory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst SuperCDMS detector towers ready for dark matter detection experiment (2023, May 18)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tretrieved 15 June 2023\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom https://phys.org/news/2023-05-supercdms-detector-towers-ready-dark.html\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This document is subject to copyright.

   "text": "Quantum computers promise to solve challenging tasks in material science and cryptography that will remain out of reach even for the most powerful conventional supercomputers in the future. Yet, this will likely require millions of high-quality qubits due to the required error correction.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgress in superconducting processors advances quickly with a current qubit count in the few hundreds. The advantages of this technology are the fast computing speed and its compatibility with microchip fabrication, but the need for ultra-cold temperatures ultimately confines the processor in size and prevents any physical access once it is cooled down.\nA modular quantum computer with multiple separately cooled processor nodes could solve this. However, single microwave photons\u2014the particles of light that are the native information carriers between superconducting qubits within the processors\u2014are not suitable to be sent through a room temperature environment between the processors. The world at room temperature is bustling with heat, which easily disturbs the microwave photons and their fragile quantum properties like entanglement.\nResearchers from the Fink group at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA), together with collaborators from TU Wien and the Technical University of Munich, demonstrated an important technological step to overcome these challenges. They entangled low-energy microwave with high-energy optical photons for the very first time.\nSuch an entangled quantum state of two photons is the foundation to wire up superconducting quantum computers via room temperature links. This has implications not only for scaling up existing quantum hardware but it is also needed to realize interconnects to other quantum computing platforms as well as for novel quantum-enhanced remote sensing applications. Their results have been published in the journal Science.\nCooling away the noise\nRishabh Sahu, a postdoc in the Fink group and one of the first authors of the new study, explains, \"One major problem for any qubit is noise. Noise can be thought of as any disturbance to the qubit. One major source of noise is the heat of the material the qubit is based on.\"\nHeat causes atoms in a material to jostle around rapidly. This is disruptive to quantum properties like entanglement, and as a result, it would make qubits unsuitable for computation. Therefore, to remain functional, a quantum computer must have its qubits isolated from the environment, cooled to extremely low temperatures, and kept within a vacuum to preserve their quantum properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n                They come with a unique variety of properties like entanglement. Entanglement is important for quantum computers because it allows them to do computations in a way that is impossible for non-quantum computers. Credit: Mark Belan/ISTA\n             \n\n\nFor superconducting qubits, this happens in a special cylindrical device that hangs from the ceiling, called a \"dilution refrigerator\" in which the \"quantum\" part of the computation takes place. The qubits at its very bottom are cooled down to only a few thousandths of a degree above absolute zero temperature\u2014at about -273 degrees Celsius. Sahu excitedly adds, \"This makes these fridges in our labs the coldest locations in the whole universe, even colder than space itself.\"\nThe refrigerator has to continuously cool the qubits but the more qubits and associated control wiring are added, the more heat is generated and the harder it is to keep the quantum computer cool. \"The scientific community predicts that at around 1,000 superconducting qubits in a single quantum computer, we reach the limits of cooling,\" Sahu cautions. \"Just scaling up is not a sustainable solution to construct more powerful quantum computers.\"\nFink adds, \"Larger machines are in development but each assembly and cooldown then becomes comparable to a rocket launch, where you only find out about problems once the processor is cold and without the ability to intervene and correct such problems.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nQuantum waves\n\"If a dilution fridge cannot sufficiently cool more than a thousand superconducting qubits at once, we need to link several smaller quantum computers to work together,\" Liu Qiu, postdoc in the Fink group and another first author of the new study, explains. \"We would need a quantum network.\"\nLinking together two superconducting quantum computers, each with its own dilution refrigerator, is not as straightforward as connecting them with an electrical cable. The connection needs special consideration to preserve the quantum nature of the qubits.\nSuperconducting qubits work with tiny electrical currents that move back and forth in a circuit at frequencies about ten billion times per second. They interact using microwave photons\u2014particles of light. Their frequencies are similar to the ones used by cellphones.\n\n\n\n\n\n                The experimental setup with the dilution refrigerator, the superconducting cavity, and the electro-optic crystal splitting and entangling the photons. Credit: Mark Belan/ISTA\n             \n\n\nThe problem is that even a small amount of heat would easily disturb single microwave photons and their quantum properties needed to connect the qubits in two separate quantum computers. When passing through a cable outside the refrigerator, the heat of the environment would render them useless.\n\"Instead of the noise-prone microwave photons that we need to do the computations within the quantum computer, we want to use optical photons with much higher frequencies similar to visible light to network quantum computers together,\" Qiu explains. These optical photons are the same kind sent through optical fibers that deliver high-speed internet to our homes. This technology is well understood and much less susceptible to noise from heat. Qiu adds, \"The challenge was how to have the microwave photons interact with the optical photons and how to entangle them.\"\nSplitting light\nIn their new study, the researchers used a special electro-optic device: an optical resonator made from a nonlinear crystal, which changes its optical properties in the presence of an electric field. A superconducting cavity houses this crystal and enhances this interaction.\nSahu and Qiu used a laser to send billions of optical photons into the electro-optic crystal for a fraction of a microsecond. In this way, one optical photon splits into a pair of new entangled photons: an optical one with only slightly less energy than the original one and a microwave photon with much lower energy.\n\"The challenge of this experiment was that the optical photons have about 20,000 times more energy than the microwave photons,\" Sahu explains, \"and they bring a lot of energy and therefore heat into the device that can then destroy the quantum properties of the microwave photons. We have worked for months tweaking the experiment and getting the right measurements.\" To solve this problem, the researchers built a bulkier superconducting device compared to previous attempts. This not only avoids a breakdown of superconductivity, but it also helps to cool the device more effectively and to keep it cold during the short timescales of the optical laser pulses.\n\"The breakthrough is that the two photons leaving the device\u2014the optical and the microwave photon\u2014are entangled,\" Qiu explains. \"This has been verified by measuring correlations between the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields of the two photons that are stronger than can be explained by classical physics.\"\n\"We are now the first to entangle photons of such vastly different energy scales.\" Fink says, \"This is a key step to creating a quantum network and also useful for other quantum technologies, such as quantum-enhanced sensing.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tR.

   "text": "It may be that the famous Higgs boson, co-responsible for the existence of masses of elementary particles, also interacts with the world of the new physics that has been sought for decades. If this were indeed to be the case, the Higgs should decay in a characteristic way, involving exotic particles. At the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Cracow, it has been shown that if such decays do indeed occur, they will be observable in successors to the LHC currently being designed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen talking about the \"hidden valley,\" our first thoughts are of dragons rather than sound science. However, in high-energy physics, this picturesque name is given to certain models that extend the set of currently known elementary particles. In these so-called Hidden Valley models, the particles of our world as described by the Standard Model belong to the low-energy group, while exotic particles are hidden in the high-energy region.\nTheoretical considerations suggest then the exotic decay of the famous Higgs boson, something that has not been observed at the LHC accelerator despite many years of searching. However, scientists at the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IFJ PAN) in Cracow argue that Higgs decays into exotic particles should already be perfectly observable in accelerators that are successors to the Large Hadron Collider\u2014if the Hidden Valley models turn out to be consistent with reality.\n\"In Hidden Valley models we have two groups of particles separated by an energy barrier. The theory is that there could then be exotic massive particles which could cross this barrier under specific circumstances. The particles like Higgs boson or hypothetic Z' boson would act as communicators between the particles of both worlds. The Higgs boson, one of the most massive particle of the Standard Model, is a very good candidate for such a communicator,\" explains Prof. Marcin Kucharczyk (IFJ PAN), lead author of an article in the Journal of High Energy Physics, which presents the latest analyses and simulations concerning the possibility of detecting Higgs boson decays in the future lepton accelerators.\nThe communicator, after passing into the low energy region, would decay into two rather massive exotic particles. Each of these would, in picoseconds\u2014that is, trillionths of a second\u2014decay into another two particles, with even smaller masses, which would then be within the Standard Model.\nSo what signs would be expected in the detectors of future accelerators? The Higgs itself would remain unnoticed, as would the two Hidden Valley particles. However, the exotic particles would gradually diverge and eventually decay, generally into quark-antiquark beauty pairs visible in modern detectors as jets of particles shifted from the axis of the lepton beam.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Observations of Higgs boson decays would therefore consist of searching for the jets of particles produced by quark-antiquark pairs. Their tracks would then have to be retrospectively reconstructed to find the places where exotic particles are likely to have decayed. These places, professionally called decay vertices, should appear in pairs and be characteristically shifted with respect to the axis of the colliding beams in the accelerator. The size of these shifts depends, among other things, on masses and average lifetime of exotic particles appearing during the Higgs decay,\" says Mateusz Goncerz, M.Sc. (IFJ PAN), co-author of the paper in question.\nThe collision energy of protons at the LHC, currently the world's largest particle accelerator, is up to several teraelectronvolts and is theoretically sufficient to produce Higgs capable of crossing the energy barrier that separates our world from the Hidden Valley. Unfortunately, protons are not elementary particles\u2014they are composed of three valence quarks bound by strong interactions, capable of generating huge numbers of constantly appearing and disappearing virtual particles, including quark-antiquark pairs.\nSuch a dynamic and complex internal structure produces huge numbers of secondary particles in proton collisions, including many quarks and antiquarks with large masses. They form a background in which it becomes practically impossible to find the particles from the exotic Higgs boson decays that are being sought.\nThe detection of possible Higgs decays to these states should be radically improved by accelerators being designed as successors to the LHC: the CLIC (Compact Linear Collider) and the FCC (Future Circular Collider). In both devices it will be possible to collide electrons with their anti-material partners, the positrons (with CLIC dedicated to this type of collision, while FCC will also allow collisions of protons and heavy ions).\nElectrons and positrons are devoid of internal structure, so the background for exotic Higgs boson decays should be weaker than at the LHC. Only will it be sufficiently so to discern the valuable signal?\nIn their research, physicists from the IFJ PAN took into account the most important parameters of the CLIC and FCC accelerators and determined the probability of exotic Higgs decays with final states in the form of four beauty quarks and antiquarks. To ensure that the predictions cover a wider group of models, the masses and mean lifetimes of the exotic particles were considered over suitably wide ranges of values.\nThe conclusions are surprisingly positive: all indications are that, in future electron-positron colliders, the background of exotic Higgs decays could be reduced even radically, by several orders of magnitude, and in some cases could even be considered negligible.\nThe existence of particle-communicators is not only possible in Hidden Valley models, but also in other extensions of the Standard Model. So if the detectors of future accelerators register a signature corresponding to the Higgs decays analyzed by the Cracow researchers, this will only be the first step on the road to understanding new physics. The next will be to collect a sufficiently large number of events and determine the main decay parameters that can be compared with the predictions of theoretical models of the new physics.\n\"The main conclusion of our work is therefore purely practical. We are not sure whether the new physics particles involved in Higgs boson decays will belong to the Hidden Valley model we used. However, we have treated this model as representative of many other proposals for new physics and have shown that if, as predicted by the model, the Higgs bosons decay into exotic particles, this phenomenon should be perfectly visible in those electron and positron colliders which are planned to be launched in the near future,\" concludes Prof. Kucharczyk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarcin Kucharczyk et al, Search for exotic decays of the Higgs boson into long-lived particles with jet pairs in the final state at CLIC, Journal of High Energy Physics (2023).

   "text": "New experiments using one-dimensional gases of ultra-cold atoms reveal a universality in how quantum systems composed of many particles change over time following a large influx of energy that throws the system out of equilibrium. A team of physicists at Penn State showed that these gases immediately respond, \"evolving\" with features that are common to all \"many-body\" quantum systems thrown out of equilibrium in this way. A paper describing the experiments appears May 17, 2023 in the journal Nature.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many major advances in physics over the last century have concerned the behavior of quantum systems with many particles,\" said David Weiss, Distinguished Professor of Physics at Penn State and one of the leaders of the research team. \"Despite the staggering array of diverse 'many-body' phenomena, like superconductivity, superfluidity, and magnetism, it was found that their behavior near equilibrium is often similar enough that they can be sorted into a small set of universal classes. In contrast, the behavior of systems that are far from equilibrium has yielded to few such unifying descriptions.\"\nThese quantum many-body systems are ensembles of particles, like atoms, that are free to move around relative to each other, Weiss explained. When they are some combination of dense and cold enough, which can vary depending on the context, quantum mechanics\u2014the fundamental theory that describes the properties of nature at the atomic or subatomic scale\u2014is required to describe their dynamics.\nDramatically out-of-equilibrium systems are routinely created in particle accelerators when pairs of heavy ions are collided at speeds near the speed-of-light. The collisions produce a plasma\u2014composed of the subatomic particles \"quarks\" and \"gluons\"\u2014that emerges very early in the collision and can be described by a hydrodynamic theory\u2014similar to the classical theory used to describe air flow or other moving fluids\u2014well before the plasma reaches local thermal equilibrium. But what happens in the astonishingly short time before hydrodynamic theory can be used?\n\"The physical process that occurs before hydrodynamics can be used has been called 'hydrodynamization,\" said Marcos Rigol, professor of physics at Penn State and another leader of the research team. \"Many theories have been developed to try to understand hydrodynamization in these collisions, but the situation is quite complicated and it is not possible to actually observe it as it happens in the particle accelerator experiments. Using cold atoms, we can observe what is happening during hydrodynamization.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Penn State researchers took advantage of two special features of one-dimensional gases, which are trapped and cooled to near absolute zero by lasers, in order to understand the evolution of the system after it is thrown of out of equilibrium, but before hydrodynamics can be applied. The first feature is experimental. Interactions in the experiment can be suddenly turned off at any point following the influx of energy, so the evolution of the system can be directly observed and measured. Specifically, they observed the time-evolution of one-dimensional momentum distributions after the sudden quench in energy.\n\"Ultra-cold atoms in traps made from lasers allow for such exquisite control and measurement that they can really shed light on many-body physics,\" said Weiss. \"It is amazing that the same basic physics that characterize relativistic heavy ion collisions, some of the most energetic collisions ever made in a lab, also show up in the much less energetic collisions we make in our lab.\"\nThe second feature is theoretical. A collection of particles that interact with each other in a complicated way can be described as a collection of \"quasiparticles\" whose mutual interactions are much simpler. Unlike in most systems, the quasiparticle description of one-dimensional gases is mathematically exact. It allows for a very clear description of why energy is rapidly redistributed across the system after it is thrown out of equilibrium.\n\"Known laws of physics, including conservation laws, in these one-dimensional gases imply that a hydrodynamic description will be accurate once this initial evolution plays out,\" said Rigol. \"The experiment shows that this occurs before local equilibrium is reached. The experiment and theory together therefore provide a model example of hydrodynamization. Since hydrodynamization happens so fast, the underlying understanding in terms of quasi-particles can be applied to any many-body quantum system to which a very large amount of energy is added.\"\nIn addition to Weiss and Rigol, the research team at Penn State includes Yuan Le, Yicheng Zhang, and Sarang Gopalakrishnan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYuan Le et al, Observation of hydrodynamization and local prethermalization in 1D Bose gases, Nature (2023).

   "text": "What makes some materials carry current with no resistance? Scientists are trying to unravel the complex characteristics. Harnessing this property, known as superconductivity, could lead to perfectly efficient power lines, ultrafast computers, and a range of energy-saving advances. Understanding these materials when they aren't superconducting is a key part of the quest to unlock that potential.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To solve the problem, we need to understand the many phases of these materials,\" said Kazuhiro Fujita, a physicist in the Condensed Matter Physics & Materials Science Department of the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory. In a new study just published in Physical Review X, Fujita and his colleagues sought to find an explanation for an oddity observed in a phase that coexists with the superconducting phase of a copper-oxide superconductor.\nThe anomaly was a mysterious disappearance of vibrational energy from the atoms that make up the material's crystal lattice. \"X-rays show that the atoms vibrate in particular ways,\" Fujita said. But as the material is cooled, the X-ray studies showed, one mode of the vibrations stops.\n\"Our study explored the relationship between the lattice structure and the electronic structure of this material to see if we could understand what was going on,\" Fujita said.\nThe Brookhaven team used a tool called a spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscope (SI-STM). By scanning the surface of the layered material with trillionths-of-a-meter precision, they could map the atoms and measure the distances between them\u2014while simultaneously measuring the electric charge at each atomic-scale location.\nThe measurements were sensitive enough to pick up the average positions of the atoms when they were vibrating\u2014and showed how those positions shifted and became locked in place when the vibrations stopped. They also showed that the anomalous vibrational disappearance was directly linked to the emergence of a \"charge density wave\"\u2014a modular distribution of charge density in the material.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Kazuhiro Fujita (left) with Brookhaven Lab co-authors Genda Gu and John Tranquada, all members of Brookhaven Lab's Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science Department, in front of the spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscope (SI-STM) used in this study. Credit: Brookhaven National Laboratory\n             \n\n\nThe electrons that make up the charge density wave are localized, meaning in fixed positions\u2014and separate from the more mobile electrons that eventually carry the current in the superconducting phase, Fujita explained. These localized electrons form a repeating pattern of higher and lower densities that can be visualized as ladders laying side-by-side (see diagram). It's the appearance of this pattern that distorts the normal vibrations of the atoms and shifts their positions along the direction of the \"rungs.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"As the temperature goes down and the charge density wave (CDW) emerges, the vibrational energy goes down,\" Fujita said. \"By measuring both charge distribution and atomic structure simultaneously, you can see how the emergence of the CDW locks the atoms in place.\"\n\"This result implies that, as the atoms vibrate, the charge density wave interacts with the lattice and quenches the lattice. It stops the vibrations and distorts the lattice,\" Fujita said.\n\n\n\n\n\n                The spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscope (SI-STM) used in this study at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

The source-DI QRNG in this work is realized through single-photon detection technology assisted by entangled photons.\nThe random numbers are extracted by a process that measures the arrival time of a photon from a pair of time\u2013energy entangled photons. The time\u2013energy entangled photon pairs are produced from a spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) process.\nThe researchers were able to confirm the security of the scheme by certifying the time\u2013energy entanglement though observation of nonlocal dispersion cancelation. To improve security, they employ a modified entropic uncertainty relation to quantify the randomness, taking into account a well-recognized problem of finite measurement range.\nThey report a secure generation rate of random bits at 4 megabits per second (Mbps), which they note could reach the level of giga bps with advanced single-photon detectors, given their faster detection speed and lower temporal resolution. Based on a PPLN waveguide SPDC source, the source-DI QRNG they realized may be further developed as an integrated chip-scale device by exploring on-chip photon generation, manipulation, and detection techniques.\nAccording to the corresponding author Yan-Xiao Gong, Professor at Nanjing University, \"Compared with several existing semi-DI QRNGs, our work achieves an excellent balance among security, speed, and practicality.\" He adds, \"This research paves the way for practical applications of secure quantum information tasks and promotes the development of high-performance and high-security quantum random number generators.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJi-Ning Zhang et al, Realization of a source-device-independent quantum random number generator secured by nonlocal dispersion cancellation, Advanced Photonics (2023).

   "text": "The theory of relativity works well when you want to explain cosmic-scale phenomena\u2014such as the gravitational waves created when black holes collide. Quantum theory works well when describing particle-scale phenomena\u2014such as the behavior of individual electrons in an atom. But combining the two in a completely satisfactory way has yet to be achieved. The search for a \"quantum theory of gravity\" is considered one of the significant unsolved tasks of science.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is partly because the mathematics in this field is highly complicated. At the same time, it is tough to perform suitable experiments: One would have to create situations in which phenomena of both the relativity theory play an important role, for example, a spacetime curved by heavy masses, and at the same time, quantum effects become visible, for example the dual particle and wave nature of light.\nAt the TU Wien in Vienna, Austria, a new approach has now been developed for this purpose: A so-called \"quantum simulator\" is used to get to the bottom of such questions: Instead of directly investigating the system of interest (namely quantum particles in curved spacetime), one creates a \"model system\" from which one can then learn something about the system of actual interest by analogy. The researchers have now shown that this quantum simulator works excellently.\nThe findings of this international collaboration involving physicists from the University of Crete, Nanyang Technological University, and FU Berlin are now published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\nLearning from one system about another\nThe basic idea behind the quantum simulator is simple: Many physical systems are similar. Even if they are entirely different kinds of particles or physical systems on different scales that, at first glance, have little to do with each other, these systems may obey the same laws and equations at a deeper level. This means one can learn something about a particular system by studying another.\n\"We take a quantum system that we know we can control and adjust very well in experiments,\" says Prof. J\u00f6rg Schmiedmayer of the Atomic Institute at TU Wien. \"In our case, these are ultracold atomic clouds held and manipulated by an atom chip with electromagnetic fields.\"\nSuppose you properly adjust these atomic clouds so that their properties can be translated into another quantum system. In that case, you can learn something about the other system from the measurement of the atomic cloud model system\u2014much like you can learn something about the oscillation of a pendulum from the oscillation of a mass attached to a metal spring: They are two different physical systems, but one can be translated into the other.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe gravitational lensing effect\n\"We have now been able to show that we can produce effects in this way that can be used to resemble the curvature of spacetime,\" says Mohammadamin Tajik of the Vienna Center for Quantum Science and Technology (VCQ)\u2014TU Wien, first author of the current paper.\nIn the vacuum, light propagates along a so-called \"light cone.\" The speed of light is constant; at equal times, the light travels the same distance in each direction. However, if the light is influenced by heavy masses, such as the sun's gravitation, these light cones are bent. The light's paths are no longer perfectly straight in curved spacetimes. This is called \"gravitational lens effect.\"\nThe same can now be shown in atomic clouds. Instead of the speed of light, one examines the speed of sound. \"Now we have a system in which there is an effect that corresponds to spacetime curvature or gravitational lensing, but at the same time, it is a quantum system that you can describe with quantum field theories,\" says Mohammadamin Tajik. \"With this, we have a completely new tool to study the connection between relativity and quantum theory.\"\nA model system for quantum gravity\nThe experiments show that the shape of light cones, lensing effects, reflections, and other phenomena can be demonstrated in these atomic clouds precisely as expected in relativistic cosmic systems. This is not only interesting for generating new data for basic theoretical research\u2014solid-state physics and the search for new materials also encounter questions that have a similar structure and can therefore be answered by such experiments.\n\"We now want to control these atomic clouds better to determine even more far-reaching data. For example, interactions between the particles can still be changed in a very targeted way,\" explains J\u00f6rg Schmiedmayer. In this way, the quantum simulator can recreate physical situations that are so complicated that they cannot be calculated even with supercomputers.\nThe quantum simulator thus becomes a new, additional source of information for quantum research\u2014in addition to theoretical calculations, computer simulations, and direct experiments. When studying the atomic clouds, the research team hopes to come across new phenomena that may have been entirely unknown up to now, which also take place on a cosmic, relativistic scale\u2014but without a look at tiny particles, they might never have been discovered.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMohammadamin Tajik et al, Experimental observation of curved light-cones in a quantum field simulator, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

   "text": "Ferromagnets are materials that become magnetized and remain so while they are exposed to an external magnetic field. In these materials, electric currents typically induce a so-called transverse Hall voltage (i.e., a voltage resulting from the deflection of electrons), which is proportional to their internal magnetization.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this effect, known as the Hall effect, is widely documented in ferromagnets, is not predicted to spontaneously occur in antiferromagnets, materials in which adjacent ions behave like magnets, aligning in regular patterns with neighboring spins facing opposite directions. Recent theoretically studies, however, suggest that a non-coplanar antiferromagnetic order could potentially induce a large spontaneous Hall effect in materials, without applying an external magnetic field to them.\nResearchers at University of Tokyo and the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS) recently carried out experiments to test this hypothesis on two van der Waals materials, namely CoTa3S6 and CoNb3S6. Their findings, published in Nature Physics, confirmed that a specific non-coplanar antiferromagnetic order characterized by scalar spin chirality could elicit a large and spontaneous topological Hall effect in these compounds.\n\"Hall effect (i.e., current-induced generation of transverse voltage) is one of the most fundamental electron transport phenomena, and it usually appears in proportion to magnetization in ferromagnets (i.e., anomalous Hall effect),\" Shinichiro Seki, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org. \"On the other hand, recent theoretical studies predict that non-coplanar spin arrangement can induce a giant Hall effect even without magnetization or external magnetic field, because conduction electrons feel a fictitious magnetic field in proportion to a solid angle spanned by neighboring spins.\"\nInspired by previous works, Seki and his colleagues set out to demonstrate the spontaneous topological Hall effect that recent theories predicted would occur in materials with a specific type of non-coplanar antiferromagnetic order. They specifically focused on two compounds with a triangular lattice and a small net magnetization.\n\"We selected CoTa3S6 and CoNb3S6 as the target materials,\" Seki said. \"To clarify their detailed spin arrangements, we performed neutron scattering experiments. By analyzing the extinction rule and intensity of magnetic Bragg reflections, the all-in-all-out type spin arrangement has been established unambiguously.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                All-in all-out type non-coplanar antiferromagnetic spin arrangement realized in CoTa3S6 and CoNb3S6. These compounds host two possible antiferromagnetic domains that are converted into each other by time-reversal operation. Since they are characterized by the opposite sign of topological Hall effect, the electrical readout of antiferromagnetic domains becomes possible. Credit: Takagi et al\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe experiments performed by Seki and his colleagues ultimately confirm theoretical predictions suggesting that a sizeable and spontaneous Hall effect can occur in some antiferromagnets, without requiring an external magnetic field. Further analyses suggested that in this effect could originate from the scalar spin chirality of the compounds that the team examined, which produce a fictitious magnetic field.\n\"Our results demonstrate that non-coplanar spin arrangement can induce a giant topological Hall effect even without magnetization or external magnetic field,\" Seki explained. \"This phenomenon enables the electrical readout of the antiferromagnetic domains, and it suggests that non-coplanar antiferromagnets may be utilized as a novel information medium.\"\nOverall, the findings of this recent study highlight the promise of leveraging the scalar spin chirality of materials to realize giant spontaneous Hall responses in non-coplanar antiferromagnets. In the future, this could pave the way for further studies in this area, potentially broadening present horizons for both physics research and technology development.\n\"Since a fictitious magnetic field plays a similar role as magnetization, non-coplanar antiferromagnets are expected to host similar functional responses as the ferromagnets,\" Seki added. \"In such systems, the fictitious magnetic field is predicted to cause not only a topological Hall effect but also various exotic phenomena such as the topological magneto-optical effect and topological Nernst effect, whose amplitude can be comparable or even larger than typical ferromagnets. The experimental demonstration of the latter phenomena would be our next target.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tH.

   "text": "Over the past decades, researchers and companies worldwide have been trying to develop increasingly advanced quantum computers. The key objective of their efforts is to create systems that will outperform classical computers on specific tasks, which is also known as realizing \"quantum advantage.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA research team at D-Wave Inc., a quantum computing company, recently created a new quantum computing system that outperforms classical computing systems on optimization problems. This system, introduced in a paper in Nature, is based on a programmable spin glass with 5,000 qubits (the quantum equivalents of bits in classical computing).\n\"This work validates the original hypothesis behind quantum annealing, coming full circle from some seminal experiments conducted in the 1990s,\" Andrew D. King, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org.\n\"These original experiments took chunks of spin-glass alloy and subjected them to varying magnetic fields, and the observations suggested that if we made a programmable quantum spin glass, it could drive down to low-energy states of optimization problems faster than analogous classical algorithms. A Science paper published in 2014 tried to verify this on a D-Wave Two processor, but no speedup was found.\"\nIn their recent work, King and his colleagues realized quantum acceleration by boosting the connectivity and coherence of the D-Wave Advantage processor, a quantum computing system recently developed at D-Wave. They ultimately pushed this processor into a coherent annealing regime with no thermal effects, which was not achieved in previous works.\nTo attain this, the researchers programmed a 5,000-qubit spin glass system that they could then control. They then used this system to tackle different optimization problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Artist's interpretation of a 3D optimization problem solved with a D-Wave Advantage processor. Credit: D-Wave.\n             \n\n\n\"This is a 'full circle' moment, in the sense that we have verified and extended the hypothesis of the UChicago and NEC researchers; quantum annealing shows a scaling advantage over simulated thermal annealing,\" King said. \"Ours is the largest programmable quantum simulation ever performed; reproducing it classically is way beyond the reach of known methods.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nTo realize coherent annealing rigorously and reliably, the team first developed a 2,000-qubit system and applied it to a simple 1D problem that can be precisely solved with classical computing methods. In their new study, on the other hand, they developed a system with over double the number of qubits and applied it to a problem that cannot be simulated using classical computing tools.\n\"For several reasons, D-Wave annealing-based quantum computers are the only quantum platform that can solve this kind of optimization problem,\" King said. \"The first is size: we looked at scaling behavior from very small spin glasses (250 qubits) to very large (5,000+ qubits); 250 is pretty much the upper limit for other platforms. The second reason is programmability: we programmed qubit networks in a three-dimensional geometry, tuning each individual qubit-qubit interaction individually.\"\nThe researchers performed their experiments on an online production system, which means that they could run alongside their cloud customer activities. In this online platform and with their 5,000-qubit spin glass system, they finally demonstrated scaling advantage on optimization problems.\n\"We have a clear view of quantum effects and very clear evidence, both theoretical and experimental, that the quantum effects are conferring a computational scaling advantage over classical methods,\" King said. \"We want to highlight the difference between this original definition of quantum advantage and the fact that it is sometimes used as a stand-in term for quantum supremacy, which we have not demonstrated. Gate-model quantum computers have not shown any capabilities approaching this for optimization, and I personally don't believe they ever will.\"\nIn light of their recent work, King and his colleagues believe that quantum annealing will always perform better than gate-model on optimization problems. This is why D-Wave is currently focusing on the development of both these platforms.\n\"For a long time, it was subject for debate whether or not coherent quantum dynamics were playing any role at all in quantum annealing,\" King said. \"While this controversy has been rebuked by previous works, this new research is the clearest demonstration yet, by far.\"\nThe work by this team of researchers and the 5,000-qubit system they realized is a significant contribution to the field of quantum computing, which specifically highlights the potential of tackling optimization problems using quantum computing systems. Their recent paper focused on attaining quantum advantage over classical systems on optimization problems by precisely controlling the quantum dynamics of a large system. In their future works, however, King and his colleagues would also like to quantify how limited classical methods are and show that the capabilities of their system can reach beyond those of supercomputers.\n\"We can also see the effects of coherence in our processors very clearly,\" King added. \"The Advantage2 processor, currently in development, promises significant improvements in that area, so we're really excited to see what we can do, not only in terms of improved optimization for customer applications, but also with more exotic experiments in coherent annealing.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAndrew D.

Soon thereafter, Nature retracted the paper due to the use of undocumented data by the research team.\nMore recently, the same team published another paper in Nature claiming to have created a different material that became superconductive at room temperature\u2014at much lower pressure than the material described in their first paper. In this new effort, the team in China duplicated the work, hoping to find the same results.\nThe work involved following the same steps taken by the team at the University of Rochester (UoR), doping a lutetium-hydrogen chemical with nitrogen. The idea behind the effort is that hydrogen-rich chemicals can, under the right conditions, incite the formation of Cooper pairs of electrons, which have been associated with superconductivity.\nThe team in China found that the process did lead to the formation of a compound that at first glance appeared to be identical to that created by the team at UoR. A closer look using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed its structure, a hydrogen-lutetium-nitrogen compound, that looked nearly identical to the UoR compound. And testing with Raman spectroscopy showed it had the same vibrational frequencies. The Chinese team even found the same color changes reported by the UoR team as the material was subjected to high pressure.\nUnfortunately, things did not look the same when the material was tested for superconductivity. The team in China was not able to detect any transition changes, even when they tested it at super-cold temperatures.\nThe Chinese team is not rejecting the results obtained by the team at UoR\u2014instead, they suggest it is possible that the nitrogen dopant present in their material was of insufficient quantity to produce the desired effect. They also note that in their sample, the dopant was unevenly distributed. They suggest further testing is needed to verify the results obtained by the group at UoR.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tXue Ming et al, Absence of near-ambient superconductivity in LuH2\u00b1xNy, Nature (2023).

However, optical elements such as variable index materials or curved photosensitive surfaces and requirements for a wide field of view and multi-layered image processing can make it challenging to study the human visual system as if it were a traditional optical system.\nIn the new research, investigators report a new approach to understanding and visualizing the optical performance of the human eye in a way that can be used to design a lens system that mimics it. To do this, they used two different computational eye models to extract key optical measurements: the entrance pupil, the resolution based on the modulation transfer function, and the relative illumination.\nThese measurements were then used to create a simple optical design that required only spherical surfaces. The lens system was designed to first render a scene with just the right amount of detail to emulate the degradation of image quality in the human field of vision. Since the pupil shape and position are also important requirement for some instruments, accurately emulating the pupil was also an aspect of this research project.\nTo see how well this approach worked, the researchers compared the performance of the lens system they designed with that of the human visual system. This quality assessment showed that the new design, which required minimal optimization, could easily reproduce the quality of the human vision system without requiring any aspherical components, which increase the complexity of the system. In fact, the initial design could be relaxed by removing some surfaces and still achieve a quality similar to that of human vision.\n\"We are currently looking at further simplifications in the design for a flat camera and how the addition of a curved image sensor, inspired by the curvature of the human eye's retina, could help in that regard,\" said Allain.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOptica\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tResearchers devise a simpler way to mimic aspects of human vision (2023, May 16)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tretrieved 15 June 2023\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom https://phys.org/news/2023-05-simpler-mimic-aspects-human-vision.html\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This document is subject to copyright.

This innovative approach enables the correction of the chromatic aberration suffered by both refractive and diffractive lenses over a wide range of X-ray energies.

As a result, many high-resolution X-ray analysis techniques can only be implemented with monochromatic X-ray beams, meaning that in many cases a large portion of the X-ray intensity is sacrificed.\nThe apochromatic X-ray optic consisted of two independent optical elements separated by a distance: a divergent refractive X-ray lens produced by state-of-the-art 3D printing with submicrometer accuracy and a Fresnel zone plate fabricated by electron beam lithography and gold electroplating. These elements were produced in-house using the cleanrooms and nanofabrication facilities at Paul Scherrer Institut.\nThe apochromatic X-ray optics was characterized by scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and ptychographic X-ray imaging. Sub-micrometer apochromatic focusing was achieved for an X-ray energy range from 7 to 12 keV. The X-ray measurements were carried out at beamline P06 at PETRA III, DESY (Hamburg, Germany).\nIn the future, apochromatic X-ray lenses could emerge as a cost-effective and compact alternative to mirror-based systems, with the further advantage of being on-axis imaging optics.

   "text": "Imagine using your cellphone to control the activity of your own cells to treat injuries and disease. It sounds like something from the imagination of an overly optimistic science fiction writer. But this may one day be a possibility through the emerging field of quantum biology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past few decades, scientists have made incredible progress in understanding and manipulating biological systems at increasingly small scales, from protein folding to genetic engineering. And yet, the extent to which quantum effects influence living systems remains barely understood.\nQuantum effects are phenomena that occur between atoms and molecules that can't be explained by classical physics. It has been known for more than a century that the rules of classical mechanics, like Newton's laws of motion, break down at atomic scales. Instead, tiny objects behave according to a different set of laws known as quantum mechanics.\nFor humans, who can only perceive the macroscopic world, or what's visible to the naked eye, quantum mechanics can seem counterintuitive and somewhat magical. Things you might not expect happen in the quantum world, like electrons \"tunneling\" through tiny energy barriers and appearing on the other side unscathed, or being in two different places at the same time in a phenomenon called superposition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantum mechanics describes the properties of atoms and molecules.\n\nI am trained as a quantum engineer. Research in quantum mechanics is usually geared toward technology. However, and somewhat surprisingly, there is increasing evidence that nature\u2014an engineer with billions of years of practice\u2014has learned how to use quantum mechanics to function optimally. If this is indeed true, it means that our understanding of biology is radically incomplete. It also means that we could possibly control physiological processes by using the quantum properties of biological matter.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nQuantumness in biology is probably real\nResearchers can manipulate quantum phenomena to build better technology. In fact, you already live in a quantum-powered world: from laser pointers to GPS, magnetic resonance imaging and the transistors in your computer\u2014all these technologies rely on quantum effects.\nIn general, quantum effects only manifest at very small length and mass scales, or when temperatures approach absolute zero. This is because quantum objects like atoms and molecules lose their \"quantumness\" when they uncontrollably interact with each other and their environment. In other words, a macroscopic collection of quantum objects is better described by the laws of classical mechanics. Everything that starts quantum dies classical. For example, an electron can be manipulated to be in two places at the same time, but it will end up in only one place after a short while\u2014exactly what would be expected classically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectrons can be in two places at the same time, but will end up in one location eventually.\n\nIn a complicated, noisy biological system, it is thus expected that most quantum effects will rapidly disappear, washed out in what the physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger called the \"warm, wet environment of the cell.\" To most physicists, the fact that the living world operates at elevated temperatures and in complex environments implies that biology can be adequately and fully described by classical physics: no funky barrier crossing, no being in multiple locations simultaneously.\nChemists, however, have for a long time begged to differ. Research on basic chemical reactions at room temperature unambiguously shows that processes occurring within biomolecules like proteins and genetic material are the result of quantum effects. Importantly, such nanoscopic, short-lived quantum effects are consistent with driving some macroscopic physiological processes that biologists have measured in living cells and organisms. Research suggests that quantum effects influence biological functions, including regulating enzyme activity, sensing magnetic fields, cell metabolism and electron transport in biomolecules.\nHow to study quantum biology\nThe tantalizing possibility that subtle quantum effects can tweak biological processes presents both an exciting frontier and a challenge to scientists. Studying quantum mechanical effects in biology requires tools that can measure the short time scales, small length scales and subtle differences in quantum states that give rise to physiological changes\u2014all integrated within a traditional wet lab environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBirds use quantum effects in navigation.\n\nIn my work, I build instruments to study and control the quantum properties of small things like electrons. In the same way that electrons have mass and charge, they also have a quantum property called spin. Spin defines how the electrons interact with a magnetic field, in the same way that charge defines how electrons interact with an electric field. The quantum experiments I have been building since graduate school, and now in my own lab, aim to apply tailored magnetic fields to change the spins of particular electrons.\nResearch has demonstrated that many physiological processes are influenced by weak magnetic fields. These processes include stem cell development and maturation, cell proliferation rates, genetic material repair and countless others. These physiological responses to magnetic fields are consistent with chemical reactions that depend on the spin of particular electrons within molecules. Applying a weak magnetic field to change electron spins can thus effectively control a chemical reaction's final products, with important physiological consequences.\nCurrently, a lack of understanding of how such processes work at the nanoscale level prevents researchers from determining exactly what strength and frequency of magnetic fields cause specific chemical reactions in cells. Current cellphone, wearable and miniaturization technologies are already sufficient to produce tailored, weak magnetic fields that change physiology, both for good and for bad. The missing piece of the puzzle is, hence, a \"deterministic codebook\" of how to map quantum causes to physiological outcomes.\nIn the future, fine-tuning nature's quantum properties could enable researchers to develop therapeutic devices that are noninvasive, remotely controlled and accessible with a mobile phone. Electromagnetic treatments could potentially be used to prevent and treat disease, such as brain tumors, as well as in biomanufacturing, such as increasing lab-grown meat production.\nA whole new way of doing science\nQuantum biology is one of the most interdisciplinary fields to ever emerge. How do you build community and train scientists to work in this area?\nSince the pandemic, my lab at the University of California, Los Angeles and the University of Surrey's Quantum Biology Doctoral Training Centre have organized Big Quantum Biology meetings to provide an informal weekly forum for researchers to meet and share their expertise in fields like mainstream quantum physics, biophysics, medicine, chemistry and biology.\nResearch with potentially transformative implications for biology, medicine and the physical sciences will require working within an equally transformative model of collaboration. Working in one unified lab would allow scientists from disciplines that take very different approaches to research to conduct experiments that meet the breadth of quantum biology from the quantum to the molecular, the cellular and the organismal.\nThe existence of quantum biology as a discipline implies that traditional understanding of life processes is incomplete. Further research will lead to new insights into the age-old question of what life is, how it can be controlled and how to learn with nature to build better quantum technologies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Conversation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

   "text": "The idea that energy is a fundamental driver of societal progress has led to the concept that a civilization's level of technological development can be measured by its ability to harness and use energy. Based on this, Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev devised a famous Kardashev Scale in 1964 as a way to classify civilizations based on their energy consumption. Our human civilization's current level is estimated to be around 0.73 as of today according to this scale.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvesting energy is one of the most critical tasks for the advancement of civilization. Early civilizations relied on manual labor and animal power for their energy needs, but it was the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries that marked a major shift in the way humans utilized energy. With the invention of steam power followed by the development of coal mining, humanity was able to harness the energy stored in fossil fuels on a massive scale. This allowed for the rapid increase in energy consumption and the rise of modern civilization.\nWhile our current lifestyle is highly demanding in energy, at the same time it makes us extremely efficient. For example, a typical worker today is thought to be ten times more productive than a worker fifty years ago. Thus the unprecedented economic growth we enjoyed in the past century was largely thanks to the increase in energy consumption. Therefore, for the economy to sustain its growth and for us to ultimately attain a post-scarcity society, we need to be capable of securing ever-increasing amounts of\u2014ideally sustainable\u2014energy sources.\nAnother key ingredient is to have developed technology to use these sources effectively. This is true for any energy source: burning fossil fuels at higher temperatures release more energy, while different designs of solar cells provide different efficiency. Thus, fundamentally, the energetic output of a source depends on our ability to extract this energy and on the current technology level.\nOf course, a part of the ability to extract energy is to realize there is some energy to extract. Imagine a caveperson stumbling upon a piece of coal\u2014they would quickly learn that such a tool can be used to paint drawings inside a cave. But the fact that such a piece of coal can be burned, thus serving as an energy source, is by no means evident.\nAlso, there is a difference between realizing that there is some energy to extract and having the means of extraction. For instance, we are well aware that the sun combines hydrogen atoms into helium through nuclear fusion, which fuels its enormous energy output. But it is an entirely different beast to achieve this process in a lab\u2014although recent technological progress pushes us closer to this ultimate goal.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nWith the recent rise in quantum technologies, the possibility of harnessing energy from quantum sources is becoming a reality. Like any technology, quantum technologies are not impervious to human limitations. Even today, quantum physicists are unsure which quantum systems can serve as an energy source and which do not. Additionally, it is unclear which can be readily available now, given our tools at hand, and which in the future.\nRecently, researchers at the Center for Theoretical Physics of Complex Systems (PCS) within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) designed a measure of extractable energy from a source\u2014named observational ergotropy\u2014which takes into account the exact capabilities of our current technology.\nErgotropy refers to the maximum amount of work that can be extracted from a system. Previous measures of quantum ergotropy were idealistic\u2014assuming that experimental capabilities were ideal. This is like assuming that our fusion plant is as efficient as the sun without considering all the issues that arise when attempting to replicate the sun artificially.\nIn contrast with previous measures, observational ergotropy provides more realistic estimates and updates in accordance with our technological prowess, telling us which sources are the best energy sources with our current experimental capabilities.\nThese results can be used, for example, to determine the best platform for the experimental realization of a quantum battery\u2014the topic in which the same IBS team has already provided fundamental theoretical achievements recently. A quantum battery can be considered any system small enough to exhibit quantum phenomena.\nImagine, for example, a line of sixteen atoms trapped by a laser or superconducting qubits from which IBM, Google, and others are building their early versions of a quantum computer. These energy-carrying platforms could power our future quantum devices, including quantum computers, quantum sensors, or devices providing quantum-encrypted, and thus completely safe, communication. In their latest study, IBS researchers showcased how the observational ergotropy discriminates which quantum battery can best power our new quantum future.\nDominik \u0160afr\u00e1nek from the PCS-IBS states, \"As our technological capabilities develop, observational ergotropy can be recalculated. In the future, different sources may deemed the new ideal, replacing the previously optimal sources. We can anticipate that this measure can be used continuously across time and constitute the fundamental tool that we can use to judge potential quantum energy sources.\"\nThe article is accepted for publication in Physical Review Letters and is available as a pre-print on the arXiv server.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDominik \u0160afr\u00e1nek et al, Work extraction from unknown quantum sources, arXiv (2022).

   "text": "For gummy candies, texture might be even more important than taste. Biting into a hard, stale treat is disappointing, even if it still carries a burst of sweetness. Keeping gummies in good condition depends on their formulation and storage, both of which alter how the molecules in the candies link together.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers from Ozyegin University and Middle East Technical University conducted a series of experiments that explore how changing key parts of the gummy-making process affects the final product, as well as how the candies behave in different storage temperatures. They used these results to identify the most shelf-stable combination for gummy candies. Their article is published in Physics of Fluids\nTo tackle these questions, the group adjusted a variety of inputs while making the gummies, from the glucose syrup-to-sucrose ratio to starch and gelatin concentrations. They wanted to understand how these changes affected features like candy texture, moisture content, and pH.\nThey then studied the resulting features of the candies before and after storage. Storage conditions varied from 10\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C for 12 weeks or 15\u00b0C to 22\u00b0C for a year.\nSuch extensive combinations of procedures presented their own hurdles during the study.\n\"A high number of parameters was the main challenge in our study,\" author Suzan Tireki said. \"We had eight different candy formulations, four different temperature conditions, and two different storage times. Another challenge was to try to find a common model for all these eight formulations, as each of them behaved differently.\"\nTo account for such a variety of variables, the researchers used a statistical model to describe how each combination affected the quality parameters of the gummy. They specifically explored the chemical crosslink distances, or the length of bonds between molecules in the candy.\n\"The most innovative part of our study was investigating the texture of the gummy candies by estimating the average crosslink distances using the hardness data coming from texture profile analysis,\" Tireki said.\nThe moisture content and pH, for example, were heavily dependent on the glucose syrup-to-sucrose ratio, whereas the gelatin content affected crosslink distances.\n\"Our most surprising finding was that hardness and average crosslink distance were not affected by the amount of starch,\" Tireki said.\nIdentifying the most stable combinations for gummies can extend shelf life and improve candy quality in different climates and across the food industry.\nThe researchers next look to explore the role of plant-based formulations, mold shapes, and packaging types.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tInvestigation of average crosslink distance and physicochemical properties of gummy candy during storage: Effect of formulation and storage temperature, Physics of Fluids (2023).

The conductive edges allow electrical current to flow without energy loss. \"At the moment, electronic devices lose a lot of energy in the form of heat, because defects in the material increase the resistance. As a result, your mobile phone can get uncomfortably hot,\" explains UT researcher Pantelis Bampoulis.\nWhile scattering at defects is allowed in normal materials, at the edges of 2D topological insulators, the scattering of electrons at defects is forbidden due to the unique topological protection mechanism. Therefore, electrical current in 2D topological insulators flows without dissipating energy. This makes them more energy-efficient than current electronic materials.\nGermanene is such a 2D topological insulator. \"Current topological insulators consist of complex structures from different types of elements. Germanene is unique in that it's made from just a single element,\" explains Bampoulis. To create this exciting material, the researchers melted germanium together with platinum. When the mixture cooled down, a tiny layer of germanium atoms arranged into a honeycomb lattice on top of the germanium-platinum alloy. This 2D layer of atoms is called germanene.\nThe researchers also discovered that the conducting properties of the material can be switched \"off\" by applying an electric field. This property is unique for a topological insulator. \"The possibility to switch between 'on' and 'off' states adds an exciting application case for germanene,\" says Bampoulis.

   "text": "Superconductors with high transition temperature (high-Tc SCs) are long-sought targets in the condensed matter physics and materials communities because of significant scientific and application values. Since the discovery of superconductivity in mercury more than one hundred years ago, only a handful of systems show Tc higher than 30 K.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nScientists at the ShanghaiTech University and their collaborators at Renmin University of China discovered superconductivity up to 32 K in MoB2 under pressure, which is the highest Tc in transition-metal borides up to now. Their findings, published in the journal National Science Review, shed light on the exploration of high-Tc superconductors in transition metal borides.\nMolybdenum diboride (MoB2) is unique among the MB2 family since it is the only material that has two structural forms, \u03b1-MoB2 phase (AlB2-type) and \u03b2-MoB2 phase (CaSi2-type).\nSynchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements indicate that \u03b2-MoB2 transforms to \u03b1-MoB2 at around 65 GPa, which possesses the same crystal structure as MgB2.\n\"A question arises naturally: is it possible to achieve superconductivity in MoB2 under high pressure?\" said Dr. Yanpeng Qi, an assistant professor of School of Physical Science and Technology at ShanghaiTech University and one of the corresponding authors.\n\"So, we carried out the in-situ high pressure electrical transport measurements. Superconductivity is observed at 21.7 GPa and Tc increases with pressure. Beyond the critical pressure (Pc = 70 GPa) where the structural phase transition, the growth of Tc slows down and the maximum Tc of 32.4 K is attained at P = 109.7 GPa, which is the highest pressure we exert on the sample.\"\nFurther theoretical calculations suggest that although the compressed MoB2 has a similar structure and comparable Tc with MgB2, the superconducting mechanism of the former is completely different from that of the latter: the d-electrons and phonon modes of transition metal Mo atoms play utterly important roles in the emergence of superconductivity in contrast to the dominance of p-electrons and phonon modes of B atoms in the superconductivity of MgB2.\nThe results shown in this work highlight the roles of transitional metals in the superconductivity in borides, which has been underestimated in borides before. Their discovery of superconductivity of MoB2 with rather high Tc could also shed light on the exploration of high-Tc superconductivity in systems with light elements considering the synergic effects of light elements with high frequency phonon modes and strongly correlated electrons in transition metals.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCuiying Pei et al, Pressure-induced Superconductivity at 32 K in MoB2, National Science Review (2023).

Smaller, lighter, and cheaper open the door to new applications and markets,\" said McGuire.\nImaging spectroscopy, also known as hyperspectral imaging, acquires information across the electromagnetic spectrum for each pixel in the image of a scene. When performed from space, it is typically used to observe solids or liquids, which requires high spatial resolution and low spectral resolution. However, there is a need for smaller and lighter-weight space-based imaging spectrometers that gather atmospheric information, which requires high spectral resolution and low spatial resolution.\nIn the new work, the researchers describe near-infrared (NIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) imaging spectrometer designs that could help fill this need. The spectrometer designs combine desirable features from several existing designs, including an immersed grating that reduces the grating size by as much as the refractive index, a Littrow optical configuration that uses the same optics before and after the grating, and a grating on a spherical surface to simply the correction of an optical error known as Petzval field curvature. Gratings separate white light into its constituent spectrum of colors.\nThe researchers developed an NIR imaging spectrometer design that covers a spectral range from 2302 nm to 2370 nm with 2,048 spectral pixels and 512 spatial pixels at an aperture of f/1.9. Using different materials, they also designed a LWIR version that covers 8 \u03bcm to 12 \u03bcm with 1536 spectral pixels and 256 spatial pixels at f/1.7.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOptica\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tResearchers design smaller, lighter space-based imaging spectrometers with high spectral resolution (2023, May 15)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tretrieved 15 June 2023\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom https://phys.org/news/2023-05-smaller-lighter-space-based-imaging-spectrometers.html\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This document is subject to copyright.

   "text": "What does the inside of a carbon atom's nucleus look like? A new study by Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich, Michigan State University and the University of Bonn provides the first comprehensive answer to this question. In the study, the researchers simulated all known energy states of the nucleus.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese include the puzzling Hoyle state. If it did not exist, carbon and oxygen would only be present in the universe in tiny traces. Ultimately, we therefore also owe it our own existence. The study has now been published in the journal Nature Communications.\nThe nucleus of a carbon atom normally consists of six protons and six neutrons. But how exactly are they arranged? And how does their configuration change when the nucleus is bombarded with high-energy radiation? For decades, science has been searching for answers to these questions. Not least because they could provide the key to a mystery that has long puzzled physicists: Why is there a significant amount of carbon in space at all\u2014an atom without which there would be no life on Earth?\nAfter all, shortly after the Big Bang, there was only hydrogen and helium. The hydrogen nucleus consists of a single proton, that of helium of two protons and two neutrons. All heavier elements were only created many billions of years later by aging stars. In them, helium nuclei fused into carbon nuclei at immense pressure and extremely high temperatures. This requires three helium nuclei to fuse together.\n\"But it's actually very unlikely for this to happen,\" explains Prof. Dr. Ulf Mei\u00dfner of the Helmholtz Institute of Radiation and Nuclear Physics at the University of Bonn and the Institute for Advanced Simulation at Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich. The reason: The helium nuclei together have a much higher energy than a carbon nucleus. However, this does not mean that they fuse particularly readily\u2014on the contrary, it is as if three people wanted to jump onto a merry-go-round. But since they run much faster than the merry-go-round turns, they do not succeed.\nSimulation on the supercomputer\nAs early as the 1950s, the British astronomer Fred Hoyle therefore postulated that the three helium nuclei first come together to form a kind of transition state. This \"Hoyle state\" has a very similar energy to the helium nuclei. To stay in the picture: It is a faster-spinning version of the merry-go-round, which the three passengers can therefore easily jump onto.\nWhen that happens, the carousel slows down to its normal speed. \"Only by taking a detour via the Hoyle state can stars create carbon at all in any appreciable quantity,\" says Mei\u00dfner, who is also a member of the Transdisciplinary Research Areas \"Modeling\" and \"Matter\" of the University of Bonn.\nAbout ten years ago, together with colleagues from the U.S., Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich and Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, he succeeded in simulating this Hoyle state for the first time. \"We already had an idea then of how the protons and neutrons of the carbon nucleus are arranged in this state,\" he explains. \"However, we were not able to prove with certainty that this assumption was true.\"\nWith the help of an advanced method, the researchers have now succeeded. This is essentially based on confinement: In reality, the protons and neutrons\u2014the nucleons\u2014can be located anywhere in space. For their calculations, however, the team restricted this freedom: \"We arranged our nuclear particles on the nodes of a three-dimensional lattice,\" Mei\u00dfner explains. \"So we allowed them only certain strictly defined positions.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nComputing time: 5 million processor hours\nThanks to this restriction, it was possible to calculate the motion of nucleons. Since nuclear particles affect each other differently depending on their distance from each other, this task is very complex. The researchers also ran their simulation several million times with slightly different starting conditions.\nThis allowed them to see where the protons and neutrons were most likely to be. \"We performed these calculations for all known energy states of the carbon nucleus,\" Mei\u00dfner says. The calculations were performed on the JEWELS supercomputer at Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich. They required a total of about 5 million processor hours, with many thousands of processors working simultaneously.\nThe results effectively provide images from the carbon nucleus. They prove that the nuclear particles do not exist independently of each other. \"Instead, they are clustered into groups of two neutrons and two protons each,\" the physicist explains. This means that the three helium nuclei can still be detected after they have fused to form the carbon nucleus.\nDepending on the energy state, they are present in different spatial formations\u2014either arranged into an isosceles triangle or like a slightly bent arm, with the shoulder, elbow joint and wrist each occupied by a cluster.\nThe study not only allows researchers to better understand the physics of the carbon nucleus, but also, as Mei\u00dfner concludes, \"The methods we have developed can easily be used to simulate other nuclei and will certainly lead to entirely new insights.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShihang Shen et al, Emergent geometry and duality in the carbon nucleus, Nature Communications (2023).

Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), could enable better control over the timing and strength of qubit outputs.\n\"These are essentially 'defective' materials; there's an absence of an atom, or a vacancy, in an otherwise perfect crystal structure,\" says Hu, senior author on the paper and the Tarr-Coyne Professor of Applied Physics and of Electrical Engineering at SEAS. \"A vacancy has its own electronic states, it has a certain spin, and it has the potential to emit photons of a particular wavelength.\"\nThese defects and the wavelengths of light they emit are sometimes called color centers because they can give diamonds and other crystals beautiful colors. But inside a nanoscale cavity in a photonic material\u2014which refract, control, or manipulate light\u2014these defects can act like optical emitters of information.\n\"Our team is really interested in the formation of these defects and how they could behave as qubits in a quantum network. Coupling an array of defects in nanophotonic cavities via entanglement would allow transmission of quantum information,\" says Aaron Day, a co-first author of the paper. He and the paper's other co-first author, Jonathan Dietz, are both applied physics Ph.D. candidates in Hu's lab.\nYet until now, there has been no way to totally control the exact location of optical emitters in nanoscale cavities without damaging the rest of the material's crystal structure.\nTypically, the process to create emitters within cavities like this\u2014100x smaller than the width of a human hair\u2014requires disrupting a material's crystal structure using ions or below-band-gap lasers. (Band gap refers to the minimum amount of energy required to excite a material's electrons so that they can freely conduct current.) But ion implantation equipment isn't available in most labs. And Hu says both conventional techniques are \"brute-force\" uses of kinetic energy that are inefficient and difficult to control\u2014more like sandblasting than careful drilling.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"To do what we wanted to do, we knew we needed to develop some extremely precise instruments,\" Hu says.\nThe team likens their solution to a stylus and template, using a laser (the stylus doing the writing) and a cavity (the template into which one writes) to form and characterize the vacancy formation. \"We wanted to do this using above-band-gap pulses of light\"\u2014containing more photon energy than below-band-gap lasers\u2014\"to more efficiently transfer energy from the laser 'stylus' to the material 'template,'\" Day says.\nFirst, Day and Dietz fabricated nanophotonic cavity devices out of commercial-grade silicon carbide in a clean room, a time-consuming and painstaking endeavor. Then they ran experiments to attempt creating optical emitters exactly where they wanted inside the cavities.\n\"At first, our laser pulses were blowing up our cavities\u2014exploding them, basically,\" Day says, an outcome that was far from ideal. \"We needed to reduce the energy of the laser dramatically.\"\nThrough trial and error, they determined how much energy and how much energy was needed to create the desired emitter while preserving the rest of the cavity without causing a \"blow up.\" They also built into their system an additional \"read-out\" laser, enabling them to assess the resonance, or photonic signals, given off by a cavity before and after it was pulsed by the defect-forming laser.\n\"One of the coolest things we found is that we could monitor the cavity, do one laser pulse to create the optical emitter, and then get a read-out of immediate changes to the cavity,\" Day says.\n\"The most exciting potential of our work is in creating scalable numbers of qubits. A means of creating and assessing emitters in real-time makes it much easier to pick a cavity with the right properties and reliably turn it into a host for quantum information,\" says Dietz.\nMoreover, Hu's team says their approach could be broadly useful for a range of fundamental questions.\n\"As we form defects within cavities, we can use those cavities to instantly tell us information about the local material environment\u2014using it as a 'nanoscope' to probe the characteristics of atomic defects,\" Day adds. \"Combining this new laser stylus with the template of using cavity resonances to provide us with real-time feedback allows us to write and improve devices seamlessly.

It also begins to rotate, in a structure called an accretion disk. The rotation causes a centrifugal force pushing the plasma outwards, which is balanced by the gravity of the black hole pulling it in.\nThese glowing rings of orbiting plasma pose a problem\u2014how does a black hole grow if the material is stuck in orbit rather than falling into the hole? The leading theory is that instabilities in magnetic fields in the plasma cause friction, causing it to lose energy and fall into the black hole.\nThe primary way of testing this has been using liquid metals that can be spun, and seeing what happens when magnetic fields are applied. However, as the metals must be contained within pipes, they are not a true representation of free-flowing plasma.\nNow, researchers at Imperial have used their Mega Ampere Generator for Plasma Implosion Experiments machine (MAGPIE) to spin plasma in a more accurate representation of accretion disks. Details of the experiment are published May 12 in the journal Physical Review Letters.\nAccelerating plasma\nFirst author Dr. Vicente Valenzuela-Villaseca completed the study during his Ph.D. in the Department of Physics at Imperial. He said, \"Understanding how accretion disks behave will not only help us reveal how black holes grow, but also how gas clouds collapse to form stars, and even how we might be able to better create our own stars by understanding the stability of plasmas in fusion experiments.\"\nThe team used the MAGPIE machine to accelerate eight plasma jets and collide them, forming a spinning column. They discovered that the closer to the inside of the spinning ring was moving faster, which is an important characteristic of accretion disks in the universe.\nMAGPIE produces short pulses of plasma, meaning only around one rotation of the disk was possible. However, this proof-of-concept experiment shows how the number of rotations could be increased with longer pulses, allowing better characterization of the disk's properties. A longer experiment run time would also allow magnetic fields to be applied, to test their influence on the friction of the system.\nDr. Valenzuela-Villaseca said, \"We are just as the start of being able to look at these accretion disks in whole new ways, which include our experiments and snapshots of black holes with the Event Horizon Telescope.

The team used the ultralow temperature terahertz microscope to take measurements on superconductors and topological semimetals. These materials were were exposed to high magnetic fields and temperatures below liquid helium (below 4.2 Kelvins or -452 degrees Fahrenheit).\nAccording to Jigang Wang, a scientist at Ames Lab, professor of Physics and Astronomy at Iowa State University, and the team leader, the team has been improving their terahertz microscope since it was first completed in 2019. \"We have improved the resolution in terms of the space, time and energy,\" said Wang. \"We have also simultaneously improved operation to very low temperatures and high magnetic fields.\"\nTo expand their terahertz microscope's capabilities to operate at extreme cryogenic and magnetic environments, Wang explained that his team developed a custom microscopy insert for a cryostat. A cryostat is a device used to maintain extremely cold temperatures. This insert was designed specifically for use with the cryogenic terahertz microscope.\nThe new microscope capabilities allowed the team to examine superconductors and topological semimetals, both which operate at these low temperatures. These materials can also move electricity with almost zero energy loss and are important for furthering quantum computing technology.\nBased on their research so far, Wang said that the microscope could lead to development of new, improved materials for highly coherent quantum devices and a better understanding of superconducting and topological materials.\nThis research is further discussed in the paper, \"A sub-2 Kelvin Cryogenic Magneto-Terahertz Scattering-type Scanning Near-Field Optical Microscope (cm-THz-sSNOM),\" published in Review of Scientific Instruments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tR.

It is increasingly important to create superconductors that can operate at ambient pressure and temperature. This would go a long way toward solving the energy crisis.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvancements with superconductivity hinge on advances in quantum materials. When electrons inside of quantum materials undergo a phase transition, the electrons can form intricate patterns, such as fractals. A fractal is a never-ending pattern. When zooming in on a fractal, the image looks the same. Commonly seen fractals can be a tree or frost on a windowpane in winter. Fractals can form in two dimensions, like the frost on a window, or in three-dimensional space like the limbs of a tree.\nDr. Erica Carlson, a 150th Anniversary Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Purdue University, led a team that developed theoretical techniques for characterizing the fractal shapes that these electrons make, in order to uncover the underlying physics driving the patterns.\nCarlson, a theoretical physicist, has evaluated high resolution images of the locations of electrons in the superconductor Bi2-xPbzSr2-yLayCuO6+x (BSCO), and determined that these images are indeed fractal and discovered that they extend into the full three-dimensional space occupied by the material, like a tree filling space.\nWhat was once thought of as random dispersions within the fractal images are purposeful and, shockingly, not due to an underlying quantum phase transition as expected, but due to a disorder-driven phase transition.\nCarlson led a collaborative team of researchers across multiple institutions and published their findings, titled \"Critical nematic correlations throughout the superconducting doping range in Bi2-xPbzSr2-yLayCuO6+x,\" in Nature Communications.\nThe team includes Purdue scientists and partner institutions. From Purdue, the team includes Carlson, Dr. Forrest Simmons, recent Ph.D. student, and former Ph.D. students Dr. Shuo Liu and Dr. Benjamin Phillabaum. The Purdue team completed their work within the Purdue Quantum Science and Engineering Institute (PQSEI). The team from partner institutions includes Dr. Jennifer Hoffman, Dr. Can-Li Song, Dr. Elizabeth Main of Harvard University, Dr. Karin Dahmen of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Dr. Eric Hudson of Pennsylvania State University.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"The observation of fractal patterns of orientational ('nematic') domains\u2014cleverly extracted by Carlson and collaborators from STM images of the surfaces of crystals of a cuprate high temperature superconductor\u2014is interesting and aesthetically appealing on its own, but also of considerable fundamental importance in coming to grips with the essential physics of these materials,\" says Dr. Steven Kivelson, the Prabhu Goel Family Professor at Stanford University and a theoretical physicist specializing in novel electronic states in quantum materials. \"Some form of nematic order, typically thought to be an avatar of a more primitive charge-density-wave order, has been conjectured to play an important role in the theory of the cuprates, but the evidence in favor of this proposition has previously been ambiguous at best. Two important inferences follow from Carlson et al.'s analysis: 1) The fact that the nematic domains appear fractal implies that the correlation length\u2014the distance over which the nematic order maintains coherence\u2014is larger than the field of view of the experiment, which means that it is very large compared to other microscopic scales. 2) The fact that patterns that characterize the order are the same as those obtained from studies of the three dimensional random-field Ising model\u2014one of the paradigrmatic models of classical statistical mechanics\u2014suggests that the extent of the nematic order is determined by extrinsic quantities and that intrinsically (i.e. in the absence of crystalline imperfections) it would exhibit still longer range correlations not just along the surface, but extending deep into the bulk of the crystal.\"\nHigh resolution images of these fractals are painstakingly taken in Hoffman's lab at Harvard University and Hudson's lab, now at Penn State, using scanning tunneling microscopes (STM) to measure electrons at the surface of the BSCO, a cuprate superconductor. The microscope scans atom by atom across the top surface of the BSCO, and what they found was stripe orientations that went in two different directions instead of the same direction. The result, seen above in red and blue, is a jagged image that forms interesting patterns of electronic stripe orientations.\n\"The electronic patterns are complex, with holes inside of holes, and edges that resemble ornate filigree,\" explains Carlson. \"Using techniques from fractal mathematics, we characterize these shapes using fractal numbers. In addition, we use statistics methods from phase transitions to characterize things like how many clusters are of a certain size, and how likely the sites are to be in the same cluster.\"\nOnce the Carlson group analyzed these patterns, they found a surprising result. These patterns do not form only on the surface like flat layer fractal behavior, but they fill space in three dimensions. Simulations for this discovery were carried out at Purdue University using Purdue's supercomputers at Rosen Center for Advanced Computing. Samples at five different doping levels were measured by Harvard and Penn State, and the result was similar among all five samples.\nThe unique collaboration between Illinois (Dahmen) and Purdue (Carlson) brought cluster techniques from disordered statistical mechanics into the field of quantum materials like superconductors. Carlson's group adapted the technique to apply to quantum materials, extending the theory of second order phase transitions to electronic fractals in quantum materials.\n\"This brings us one step closer to understanding how cuprate superconductors work,\" explains Carlson. \"Members of this family of superconductors are currently the highest temperature superconductors that happen at ambient pressure. If we could get superconductors that work at ambient pressure and temperature, we could go a long way toward solving the energy crisis because the wires we currently use to run electronics are metals rather than superconductors. Unlike metals, superconductors carry current perfectly with no loss of energy. On the other hand, all the wires we use in outdoor power lines use metals, which lose energy the whole time they are carrying current. Superconductors are also of interest because they can be used to generate very high magnetic fields, and for magnetic levitation. They are currently used (with massive cooling devices!) in MRIs in hospitals and levitating trains.\"\nNext steps for the Carlson group are to apply the Carlson-Dahmen cluster techniques to other quantum materials.\n\"Using these cluster techniques, we have also identified electronic fractals in other quantum materials, including vanadium dioxide (VO2) and neodymium nickelates (NdNiO3). We suspect that this behavior might actually be quite ubiquitous in quantum materials,\" says Carlson.\nThis type of discovery leads quantum scientists closer to solving the riddles of superconductivity.\n\"The general field of quantum materials aims to bring to the forefront the quantum properties of materials, to a place where we can control them and use them for technology,\" Carlson explains. \"Each time a new type of quantum material is discovered or created, we gain new capabilities, as dramatic as painters discovering a new color to paint with.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCan-Li Song et al, Critical nematic correlations throughout the superconducting doping range in Bi2-xPbzSr2-yLayCuO6+x, Nature Communications (2023).

Materials with a low work function require less energy to remove electrons and make them free to move around; whereas materials with a high work function need more energy to remove electrons.\nA lower work function is critical for enhancing the performance of electron sources and contributes to the development of advanced materials and technologies that can have practical applications in various fields, such as electron microscopy, accelerator science, and semiconductor manufacturing.\n\n\n\n\n\n                A schematic diagram of the work function modulation mechanism by graphene and hBN coating.

   "text": "New findings from a team of researchers at MIT and elsewhere could help pave the way for new kinds of devices that efficiently bridge the gap between matter and light. These might include computer chips that eliminate inefficiencies inherent in today's versions, and qubits, the basic building blocks for quantum computers, that could operate at room temperature instead of the ultracold conditions needed by most such devices.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new work, based on sandwiching tiny flakes of a material called perovskite in between two precisely spaced reflective surfaces, is detailed in the journal Nature Communications, in a paper by MIT recent graduate Madeleine Laitz Ph.D. '22, postdoc Dane deQuilettes, MIT professors Vladimir Bulovic, Moungi Bawendi and Keith Nelson, and seven others.\nBy creating these perovskite sandwiches and stimulating them with laser beams, the researchers were able to directly control the momentum of certain \"quasiparticles\" within the system. Known as exciton-polariton pairs, these quasiparticles are hybrids of light and matter. Being able to control this property could ultimately make it possible to read and write data to devices based on this phenomenon.\n\"What's particularly fascinating about exciton-polaritons,\" Laitz says, is that they lie \"on a spectrum between purely electronic and photonic systems.\" These quasiparticles \"have the characteristics of both, and thus you can leverage exciton-polaritons to utilize the best properties of each.\"\nFor example, purely electronic transistors, she explains, have inherent losses to capacitance effects at each interface between devices, whereas \"purely photonic systems have challenges in engineering, in that it's very hard to get photons to interact, and you have to rely on complex interferometric schemes.\" By contrast, the quasiparticles used by this team can be easily controlled through multiple variables.\nThe quasiparticle is \"a combined state of light and neutral charge,\" Bulovic says. \"As a result, you can perturb that combined state either with light or charge, and hence, if you need to modulate that state, you have extra levers you can utilize. These extra levers can now allow one to manipulate this combined state of matter in a more energy-efficient manner.\"\nWhat's more, the materials involved are easily manufactured using room-temperature, solution-based processing methods, and thus could be relatively easy to produce at scale once practical systems are designed. So far, the work is at a very early stage, as researchers are still studying newly discovered effects; practical applications could be 5 to 10 years away, Laitz says.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nPerovskites have attracted much attention in recent years as materials for new lightweight, flexible solar photovoltaic panels, so there has been a great deal of research on their properties and fabrication methods. The team settled on a particular version of perovskite called phenethylammonium lead iodide.\n\"Halide perovskites harvest light really well, and turn photons into electrons or excitons, depending on the dimensionality and material properties of the perovskite,\" she says, which is why the researchers chose this particular version of this large class of materials for their research.\nThen, to create what is known as an optical cavity that can trap photons of light, the researchers placed tiny flakes of the material between mirrored surfaces. Two of these ultrathin layers, just tens of nanometers thick, were spaced a precise distance apart using spacer layers, so that the mirrors were separated by half the wavelength of light that this perovskite material both absorbs and emits.\nUsing perovskite tuned to a wavelength of green light, the emitted green light then bounces back and forth between the mirrors. \"It's reabsorbed by the material, re-emitted, reabsorbed, re-emitted, reabsorbed over and over again so quickly that you're interconverting between the photon and the exciton, such that you generate a superposition of both,\" Laitz says.\nThis can lead to the state of matter known as a Bose-Einstein Condensate, in which all the particles have identical energy states and behave much like one large particle. Laitz says that such condensates carry a property known as spin, and this can be modified by light or electrical stimulation; the resulting changes can be measured by observing photoluminescence from the material using a spectroscopic imaging system. And unlike purely photonic systems, where there is little interaction between photons, these materials have strong interactions with both light and electrons.\nArrays of such condensates have been produced, but typically only at ultralow, cryogenic temperatures so far. \"Perovskites offer the opportunity for realizing this phenomenon at elevated temperatures,\" but it's hard to form the condensates in perovskites. This new research shows fundamental characteristics of the process that leads to condensation, Laitz says. In their paper, \"we propose several strategies from a material perspective and a device architecture perspective to enable this.\" And that could be a key step toward eventual room-temperature qubits, she says.\nWhile such devices may take several years to develop, a more near-term application of the new findings could be in producing new kinds of light-emitting devices, deQuilettes says, including ones that could provide a steerable light source with directional output that can be controlled electronically.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMadeleine Laitz et al, Uncovering temperature-dependent exciton-polariton relaxation mechanisms in hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites, Nature Communications (2023).

Such a superconductor would enable power grids with unprecedented efficiency, ultrafast microchips, and electromagnets so powerful they could levitate trains or control fusion reactors.\nIn their search, scientists are probing multiple classes of materials, slowly nudging up the temperature they superconduct at and decreasing the pressure they require to remain stable. One such group of materials is polyhydrides\u2014compounds with extremely high hydrogen content. At -23\u00b0C, the current champion for high-temperature superconductivity is a lanthanum polyhydride with the formula LaH10. The trade-off: It requires the pressure of 1.5 million atmospheres. At the opposite end of the spectrum, cuprates are a class of materials that superconduct under normal atmospheric pressure but require cooler temperatures\u2014no more than -140\u00b0.\nNow, Skoltech researchers and their Chinese colleagues have managed to loosen up the pressure requirements of polyhydride superconductors. To do this, the team tweaked the lanthanum-hydrogen system by adding some cerium into the mix. Physically, that meant making a lanthanum-cerium alloy and heating it up in a high-pressure cell with ammonia borane, a substance that releases a lot of hydrogen as it decomposes.\nLanthanum and cerium are two very similar atoms that form analogous compounds and may often be substituted for one another. However, while superconductivity has been reported for the polyhydrides LaH10 and CeH10, as well as CeH9, the corresponding LaH9 phase is rarely seen by experimenters. The scientists decided to test out the hypothesis: It should be possible to stabilize LaH9 by supplementing it with an appropriately chosen additive, such as cerium, provided that this alters the original material's structure. And it worked.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Very high pressure forces pure lanthanum and hydrogen into the LaH10 structure. But if you replace roughly 1 in 4 lanthanum atoms with cerium, this reorganizes the structure into the arrangement seen in CeH9. In that sense, the introduction of the third element alters the structure that the pure material would have otherwise assumed. And this additive does contribute to stability: Compared with the 1.5 million atmospheres you need for LaH10, our lanthanum-cerium polyhydride is stable at just 1 million atmospheres. This is about the same pressure the cerium polyhydrides require, yet those exhibit superconductivity only below -158\u00b0C, whereas the new superconductor works at -97\u00b0C. So it's a good compromise, but more importantly, it's a reassurance that our reasoning is right,\" study co-author Professor Artem R. Oganov of Skoltech comments.\nWorking in a field where not too long ago, many doubted that so-called conventional superconductivity\u2014like the one in polyhydrides\u2014could ever exist at temperatures above -230\u00b0C or so, Oganov assigns particular importance to testing out and refining the rules that make it possible to discover and improve superconductors in a reliable and systematic way. So even though he thinks that polyhydrides in general will hardly ever be made to superconduct at atmospheric pressure (which is a necessary condition for large-scale applications such as maglev trains or lossless power grids), he says their study affords insights into superconductivity that take us closer to attaining that ultimate goal with other materials.\n\"Polyhydrides are an Eldorado for fundamental superconductor research under pressure,\" Oganov says. \"And by synthesizing our new compound, we have both tested and refined the tools and tricks useful in this quest and supplied a convenient material for further studies.\"\n\"The work is also interesting for two key experiments: It shows the possible anisotropy of the upper critical field for hydrides. That is, the dependence of critical temperature on the direction of the magnetic field. And it also shows that with a decrease in pressure, a pseudogap phase manifests in polyhydrides,\" study co-author and Skoltech Ph.D. alumnus Dmitrii Semenok said, adding that both properties are characteristic of cuprate superconductors. \"Thus, on closer inspection, polyhydrides turn out to be much like cuprates despite the different mechanisms of superconductivity.\"\nAsked about other promising compounds that current polyhydride research is leading to, the researchers responded that hydrides and borohydrides of calcium, yttrium, lanthanum, and magnesium seem to deserve research attention at this point.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWuhao Chen et al, Enhancement of superconducting properties in the La\u2013Ce\u2013H system at moderate pressures, Nature Communications (2023).

   "text": "A team of researchers led by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Trevor David Rhone, assistant professor in the Department of Physics, Applied Physics, and Astronomy, has identified novel van der Waals (vdW) magnets using cutting-edge tools in artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, the team identified transition metal halide vdW materials with large magnetic moments that are predicted to be chemically stable using semi-supervised learning.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese two-dimensional (2D) vdW magnets have potential applications in data storage, spintronics, and even quantum computing.\nRhone specializes in harnessing materials informatics to discover new materials with unexpected properties that advance science and technology. Materials informatics is an emerging field of study at the intersection of AI and materials science. His team's latest research was recently featured on the cover of Advanced Theory and Simulations.\n2D materials, which can be as thin as a single atom, were only discovered in 2004 and have been the subject of great scientific curiosity because of their unexpected properties. 2D magnets are significant because their long-range magnetic ordering persists when they are thinned down to one or a few layers. This is due to magnetic anisotropy.\nThe interplay with this magnetic anisotropy and low dimensionality could give rise to exotic spin degrees of freedom, such as spin textures that can be used in the development of quantum computing architectures. 2D magnets also span the full range of electronic properties and can be used in high-performance and energy-efficient devices.\nRhone and team combined high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations, to determine the vdW materials' properties, with AI to implement a form of machine learning called semi-supervised learning. Semi-supervised learning uses a combination of labeled and unlabeled data to identify patterns in data and make predictions. Semi-supervised learning mitigates a major challenge in machine learning\u2014the scarcity of labeled data.\n\"Using AI saves time and money,\" said Rhone. \"The typical materials discovery process requires expensive simulations on a supercomputer that can take months. Lab experiments can take even longer and can be more expensive. An AI approach has the potential to speed up the materials discovery process.\"\nUsing an initial subset of 700 DFT calculations on a supercomputer, an AI model was trained that could predict the properties of many thousands of materials candidates in milliseconds on a laptop. The team then identified promising candidate vdW materials with large magnetic moments and low formation energy. Low formation energy is an indicator of chemical stability, which is an important requirement for synthesizing the material in a laboratory and subsequent industrial applications.\n\"Our framework can easily be applied to explore materials with different crystal structures, as well,\" said Rhone. \"Mixed crystal structure prototypes, such as a data set of both transition metal halides and transition metal trichalcogenides, can also be explored with this framework.\"\n\"Dr. Rhone's application of AI to the field of materials science continues to produce exciting results,\" said Curt Breneman, dean of Rensselaer's School of Science. \"He has not only accelerated our understanding of 2D materials that have novel properties, but his findings and methods are likely to contribute to new quantum computing technologies.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrevor David Rhone et al, Artificial Intelligence Guided Studies of van der Waals Magnets, Advanced Theory and Simulations (2023).

Until now.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Abelian anyons\u2014the only particles that have been predicted to break this rule\u2014have been sought for their fascinating features and their potential to revolutionize quantum computing by making the operations more robust to noise. Microsoft and others have chosen this approach for their quantum computing effort. But after decades of efforts by researchers in the field, observing non-Abelian anyons and their strange behavior has proven challenging, to say the least.\nIn a paper posted on the preprint server arXiv last October and published in Nature today, researchers at Google Quantum AI announced that they had used one of their superconducting quantum processors to observe the peculiar behavior of non-Abelian anyons for the first time ever.\nThey also demonstrated how this phenomenon could be used to perform quantum computations. Earlier this week the quantum computing company Quantinuum released another study on the topic, complementing Google's initial discovery. These new results open a new path toward topological quantum computation, in which operations are achieved by winding non-Abelian anyons around each other like strings in a braid.\nGoogle Quantum AI team member and first author of the manuscript, Trond I. Andersen says, \"Observing the bizarre behavior of non-Abelian anyons for the first time really highlights the type of exciting phenomena we can now access with quantum computers.\"\nImagine you're shown two identical objects and then asked to close your eyes. Open them again, and you see the same two objects. How can you determine if they have been swapped? Intuition says that if the objects are truly identical, there is no way to tell.\nQuantum mechanics supports this intuition, but only in our familiar three-dimensional world. If the identical objects are restricted to only move in a two-dimensional plane, sometimes, our intuition can fail and quantum mechanics allows for something bizarre: non-Abelian anyons retain a sort of memory\u2014it is possible to tell when two of them have been exchanged, despite being completely identical.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThis \"memory\" of the non-Abelian anyons can be thought of as a continuous line in space-time: the particle's so-called \"world-line.\" When two non-Abelian anyons are exchanged, their world-lines wrap around one another. Wrap them in the right way, and the resulting knots and braids form the basic operations of a topological quantum computer.\nThe team started by preparing their superconducting qubits in an entangled quantum state that is well represented as a checkerboard\u2014a familiar configuration for the Google team, who recently demonstrated a milestone in quantum error correction using this setup. In the checkerboard arrangement, related\u2014but less useful\u2014particles called Abelian anyons can emerge.\nTo realize non-Abelian anyons, the researchers stretched and squashed the quantum state of their qubits to transform the checkered pattern into oddly shaped polygons. Particular vertices in these polygons hosted the non-Abelian anyons. Using a protocol developed by Eun-Ah Kim at Cornell University and former postdoc Yuri Lensky, the team could then move the non-Abelian anyons around by continuing to deform the lattice and shifting the locations of the non-Abelian vertices.\nIn a series of experiments, the researchers at Google observed the behavior of these non-Abelian anyons and how they interacted with the more mundane Abelian anyons. Weaving the two types of particles around one another yielded bizarre phenomena\u2014particles mysteriously disappeared, reappeared and shapeshifted from one type to another as they wound around one another and collided.\nMost importantly, the team observed the hallmark of non-Abelian anyons: when two of them were swapped, it caused a measurable change in the quantum state of their system\u2014a striking phenomenon that had never been observed before.\nFinally, the team demonstrated how braiding of non-Abelian anyons might be used in quantum computations. By braiding several non-Abelian anyons together, they were able to create a well-known quantum entangled state called the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state.\nThe physics of non-Abelian particles is also at the core of the approach that Microsoft has chosen for their quantum computing effort. While they are attempting to engineer material systems that intrinsically host these anyons, the Google team has now shown that the same type of physics can be realized on their superconducting processors.\nThis week the quantum computing company Quantinuum released an impressive complementary study that also demonstrated non-Abelian braiding, in this case using a trapped-ion quantum processor. Andersen is excited to see other quantum computing groups observing non-Abelian braiding as well. He says, \"It will be very interesting to see how non-Abelian anyons are employed in quantum computing in the future, and whether their peculiar behavior can hold the key to fault-tolerant topological quantum computing.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle Quantum et al, Non-Abelian braiding of graph vertices in a superconducting processor, Nature (2023).

   "text": "Super resolution imaging has been a hot topic for over the last few decades in the imaging community, particularly, in the field of microscopy. Although several interesting feats have been achieved in the microscopic imaging community there remains a large gap to bridge between microscopic imaging and the endoscopic imaging community.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo of the main imaging parameters that bridges the prior gap is image acquisition and processing at a wide field of view (FOV) and large depth of field (DOF) which typically is a bottleneck that one needs to circumvent when attempting to attain super resolution in images. In microscopy, a method that is capable of attaining wide field of view with high temporal resolution and low phototoxicity is called structured illumination microscopic (SIM). A standard SIM can improve the spatial resolution to about two times of the diffraction limit of an optical system.\nBecause SIM aims to achieve very high spatial resolution, the DOF is typically very small. This means that SIM requires a high level of focusing distance control which is one practical limitation for microscopy applications. In contrast, in endoscopic imaging, the exceptionally wide FOV and large DOF are critical due to the very nature of endoscopic imaging and the samples they image and explore. Hence, to explore the possibility of achieving super resolution in endoscopic images at wide FOV and large DOF is of great interest.\nA new technique called speckle structured illumination endoscopy (SSIE) is explored in this work. In the study, published in Opto-Electronic Advances, the authors introduce two fibers in a standard white light endoscope (WLE) to deliver high resolution speckles to illuminate the object. The random speckle patterns are generated from the interference between the laser light from the two fibers. A number of images with standard resolution are collected by the WLE camera and then subjected to an image reconstruction algorithm to yield a single super resolution image.\nThe wide FOV and the large DOF is obtained in this study along with super resolution by fashioning the optical light sources, namely, the multimode fibers carrying the random illumination patterns from the laser in an orientation to not only cover a wide FOV and DOF but also give rise to large angle interference between the illumination beams which contributes to achieving super resolution in imaging. The study is examined on both planar and non-planar surfaces, attesting to the SSIE's objective of imaging at large DOF.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, from a theoretical perspective which is also explored in this study, the FOV and the DOF can be extended to as large as a WLE may allow. Furthermore, the SSIE does not require a stringent control of the illumination patterns, calibration protocols or that of the focusing optics as in the case of SIM, thereby, greatly simplifying the experimental setup.\nA demonstration of 2 to 4.5 times enhancement in resolution at wide FOV and DOF over the systemic limit of a standard WLE is demonstrated in this study. The experimental results in the study indicate the potential of the SSIE in presenting a unique route to super resolution in endoscopic imaging at wide FOV and DOF which may be beneficial to the practice of clinical endoscopy. In a broader perspective, this technique of imaging can also be adopted into other similar domains of biomedical, medical, and camera-based systems where high resolution at wide FOV and DOF is preferred or critical.\nThe authors of this article propose and demonstrate a novel method called speckle structured illumination endoscopy utilized for achieving super resolution in images acquired during the process of endoscopy. The speckle structured illumination refers to nothing more than the usage and direction of random optical illumination patterns originating from a coherent light source such as a laser, onto the sample under study.\nThe significance of this work mainly lies in enhancing image resolution at optimal imaging parameters of a wide field of view and large depth of field, as wide and large as a typical white light endoscope may allow in comparison to the existing high-resolution endoscopic state of the art which have very limited field of view and depth of field in its image examination and acquisition. High resolution always come with a compromise in the field of view or depth of field as they are typically inversely related to each other.\nHence in this study, the major bottleneck that is being addressed is the capability of achieving super resolution in endoscopic images along with the otherwise inversely related imaging parameters of a wide field of view and large depth of field. Additionally, the system in this study does not rely on any specific properties of the specimen or sample, therefore, any sample can be used for imaging further broadening its potential impact and influence. This study can potentially benefit the endoscopic imaging community in clinics and health centers. Both from an imaging and device-based perspective, no fancy equipment or stringent imaging control is needed for the acquisition and processing of image data.\nThis makes the speckle structured illumination endoscopic system fairly easy to be translated and adopted into imaging fields broader than just endoscopy. The method will be most feasible if and when it is potentially translated into similar imaging fields that implement an incoherent imaging modality, typically, methods that make use of fluorescent dyes which stain the sample under study. In addition, the speckle structured endoscopic illumination demonstrations are independent of the internal structure, type, or specifications of the scope or probe used. Therefore, the imaging technique can be translated into any white light endoscopic modality with similar resolution improvement factors whether its application is clinical or industrial, since the working principle remains the same.\nFurthermore, in a realistic imaging scenario, the sample under study would be possibly non-planar. In this study since we explore the possibility of imaging three dimensional nonplanar surfaces by random optical illuminations, a direct translation of the imaging concept adopted in this study to other imaging fields such as biomedical, medical, or camera-based imaging systems is possible, making it fairly straightforward.\nIn a broader sense, any imaging system that has a camera to acquire images and that can employ the facility and routing of random pattern based optical illuminations onto the sample by a fashion as demonstrated in this study will be able to achieve super resolution at optimal imaging parameters as explored in this work, particularly in systems that might benefit from having a large imaging depth of field such as in endoscopy, depth-based imaging in camera systems, microscopy and similar fields.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tElizabeth Abraham et al, Speckle structured illumination endoscopy with enhanced resolution at wide field of view and depth of field, Opto-Electronic Advances (2023).

Moreover, when a positive bias is applied to the device it yields a luminance of more than 7,000 cd/m2 at 523 nm (green color). When a negative bias is applied to the device it operates as a photodetector with a sensitivity up to 0.75 A/W (for wavelength in blue or UV regions), specific detectivity of 8.56\u22191011 Jones, and linear dynamic range of 48 dB. The technological potential of such a device is proven by the demonstration of a 24-pixel indicator display as well as successful device miniaturization by the creation of electroluminescent images with the smallest features less than 50 \u03bcm.\nThe perovskite light-emitting electrochemical cells are a viable alternative to the conventional perovskite material device research light-emitting diodes. Not only do perovskite light-emitting electrochemical cells have a much simpler architecture and design with one single functional layer replacing multiple active, charge-separation and transport layers of perovskite light-emitting diodes, but also perovskite light-emitting electrochemical cells can possess all the extraordinary properties of LEDs, such as high efficiency, high color purity and broad color gamut.\nThe reason that perovskite light-emitting electrochemical cells are capable of this is completely different from the LEDs operation principle: when electrical bias is applied to the device, mobile positive and negative ions inside the perovskite layer migrate toward corresponding electrodes dynamically forming a p-i-n structure inside the perovskite layer, which allows effective electron-hole recombination with photon emission. Comprehensive research on various back-ups to conventional LED technology is a valuable source of diversifying the pool of industrial opportunities.\nThe reported device demonstrates exceptional light-emitting and light-detecting (\"dual-functionality\") characteristics alongside an enhanced in-operation heating durability. This is possible due to the utilization of silicon substrate in the perovskite light-emitting electrochemical cells' design. Silicon material is one of the stepping stones of the CMOS technology\u2014complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor technology\u2014technology used in manufacturing of all semiconductor chips, displays, etc. Integration of such an emerging material like perovskite material with silicon brings the R&D community one step closer to obtaining an industrial perovskite light-emitting electrochemical cell.\nThe broader benefit of the reported device design is its ITO-free transparent electrode based on single-walled carbon nanotubes. ITO\u2014Indium-Tin Oxide\u2014is a transparent conductive material widely used in perovskite photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Indium is a depleting element and, thus, the replacement of ITO by other materials based on earth-abundant elements would overcome the indium deficiency in the industry.\nThe research is published in the journal Opto-Electronic Advances.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMaria Baeva et al, ITO-free silicon-integrated perovskite electrochemical cell for light-emission and light-detection, Opto-Electronic Advances (2023).

   "text": "Coded aperture imaging (CAI) is another incoherent imaging technique developed in the 20th century to achieve lensless 2D imaging with nonvisible wavelengths. In CAI, the light from an object is modulated by a coded mask and recorded. The recorded intensity distribution is processed with the point spread function (PSF) recorded under identical conditions to reconstruct the object image.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn IDH technique using CAI called coded aperture correlation holography (COACH) was developed in 2016, wherein the light from an object is modulated by a random phase mask and interfered with an unmodulated object wave. In COACH, there is no numerical image plane unlike its precursors. Therefore, the reconstruction technique of CAI was mandatory, which involves the recording of point spread holograms (PSHs) along all axial planes, followed by computational processing of the object hologram with the PSHs. At this point, a connection between CAI and IDH was established.\nLater, it was found by the research group that the 3D information is encoded in both the amplitude and the phase of the light diffracted by the random phase mask. This led to the development of a simpler version of COACH called interferenceless COACH (I-COACH). I-COACH had the advantages of both IDH and CAI, that is, 3D imaging capability and simple optical architecture, respectively. The research is published in the journal Opto-Electronic Advances.\nOne drawback with I-COACH is the low SNR due to scattering by the random phase mask, which makes it unsuitable for light-sensitive applications and complicated microscope configurations. The main reason for using a random phase mask in I-COACH is that the intensity distribution obtained by scattering has sharp autocorrelation functions and low cross-correlation along depth (SALCAD).\nDuring an attempt to apply I-COACH to the infrared microscope (IRM) of the Australian Synchrotron, it was found that the Cassegrain objective lens exhibited the SALCAD property except with a higher SNR than a random phase mask. This discovery opened up many possibilities. However, the optimal reconstruction method used in I-COACH, called nonlinear reconstruction (NLR), did not reconstruct images with a high SNR. Therefore, a novel reconstruction method called the Lucy\u2013Richardson\u2013Rosen algorithm (LRRA) was developed by integrating NLR with the well-known Lucy\u2013Richardson algorithm.\nThe LRRA method with the Cassegrain objective lens as the coded aperture reconstructed 3D object information with a high SNR. The schematic of the IRM system and the recorded PSF images for 0 to 200 \u03bcm in steps of 50 \u03bcm are shown in Fig. 1. The schematic of the LRRA, the images recorded for pinholes and silk samples, and their reconstructions using LRRA are shown in Fig. 2 (a\u2013e).\n\n\n\n\n\n                Figure 2.

When the imaging condition is satisfied, reconstruction is not needed, and in other cases, a reconstruction by LRRA is needed. The outcome of this research enabled the deep deconvolution of images recorded by a refractive lens and also simplified the IDH technique. The acceleration of computational processing time and the experimental demonstration with natural visible light are key to developing real-time 3D imaging applications by the proposed technique. The reported study could have a significant effect on the current state-of-the-art IDH as well as CAI techniques and open new pathways to imaging.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTatsuki Tahara et al, Adding dimensions with Lucy\u2013Richardson\u2013Rosen algorithm to incoherent imaging, Opto-Electronic Advances (2023).

   "text": "The excitonic insulator is an electronically driven phase of matter that can occur in solids. Scientists are searching for ways to detect and stabilize this exotic order in candidate quantum materials because it could pave the way towards superfluid energy transport with no net charge (which is distinct from superconductivity). If realized, this phenomenon could lead to a new generation of devices where energy is transported at the nanoscale with high coherence and minimal dissipation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, spotting this phase in real solids has proven difficult so far. For the past two decades, it had been proposed that the quasi-two-dimensional solid Ta2NiSe5 may support an excitonic insulator phase above room temperature.\nAbove a critical temperature TC = 328 K, this material crystallizes in a layered structure that consists of parallel Ta and Ni chains. At TC, the system undergoes a semimetal-to-semiconductor transition, accompanied by a structural reorganization of the crystalline lattice. The scientific community has been engaged in an intense debate regarding whether this phase transition was induced by a purely electronic or a structural instability.\nIn a recently published study on PNAS, researchers in the U.S., Germany, and Japan probed the fundamental processes underpinning that transition via a joint experimental-theoretical approach.\nUsing an advanced experimental tool called time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy under highly controlled conditions, they exposed Ta2NiSe5 to a tailored laser pulse and recorded a real-time movie of the fundamental components of the excitons (i.e., electrons and holes) as well as the structural degrees of freedom. To resolve these microscopic phenomena, the movie had to achieve an ultrafast time resolution of less than a millionth of a billionth of a second.\nTracking the dynamics of the material's electronic and crystal structure after light excitation revealed spectroscopic fingerprints that are compatible only with a dominant order parameter of structural nature. This implies that the changes in the crystal structure actually hinder the development of electronic superfluidity in this quantum material.\n\"This work demonstrates that Ta2NiSe5 is not an excitonic insulator and that dissipationless energy transport is hampered by the prominent rearrangement of the crystal structure,\" says Nuh Gedik, Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who coordinated the research.\n\"Our experiments provide a new approach to identifying the driving force behind spontaneous symmetry-breaking in a wide range of candidate excitonic insulators,\" adds lead author Edoardo Baldini, former postdoctoral fellow at MIT and now Assistant Professor of Physics at the University of Texas at Austin.\nThe findings were backed up by state-of-the-art calculations at several institutions who combined different theoretical techniques to understand the microscopic origin of these changes in Ta2NiSe5 with unprecedented accuracy.\n\"Confirming the microscopic mechanism driving this transition to be structural in nature required highly demanding and intertwined electronic and structural modeling that also provided relevant information on the impact of possible excitonic contributions,\" says Theory Director Angel Rubio from the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter (MPSD) in Hamburg, Germany.\nThe groups of Eugene Demler at Harvard University, Andrew Millis at Columbia University, and Igor Mazin at George Mason University were partners in the theoretical collaboration.

   "text": "The silicon microchips of future quantum computers will be packed with millions, if not billions of qubits\u2014the basic units of quantum information\u2014to solve the greatest problems facing humanity. And with millions of qubits needing millions of wires in the microchip circuitry, it was always going to get cramped in there.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut now engineers at UNSW Sydney have made an important step toward solving a long-standing problem about giving their qubits more breathing space\u2014and it all revolves around jellybeans.\nNot the kind we rely on for a sugar hit to get us past the 3pm slump. But jellybean quantum dots\u2014elongated areas between qubit pairs that create more space for wiring without interrupting the way the paired qubits interact with each other.\nAs lead author Associate Professor Arne Laucht explains, the jellybean quantum dot is not a new concept in quantum computing, and has been discussed as a solution to some of the many pathways toward building the world's first working quantum computer.\n\"It has been shown in different material systems such as gallium arsenide. But it has not been shown in silicon before,\" he says.\nSilicon is arguably one of the most important materials in quantum computing, A/Prof. Laucht says, as the infrastructure to produce future quantum computing chips is already available, given we use silicon chips in classical computers. Another benefit is that you can fit so many qubits (in the form of electrons) on the one chip.\n\"But because the qubits need to be so close together to share information with one another, placing wires between each pair was always going to be a challenge.\"\nIn a study published today in Advanced Materials, the UNSW team of engineers describe how they showed in the lab that jellybean quantum dots were possible in silicon. This now opens the way for qubits to be spaced apart to ensure that the wires necessary to connect and control the qubits can be fit in between.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: University of New South Wales\n\nHow it works\nIn a normal quantum dot using spin qubits, single electrons are pulled from a pool of electrons in silicon to sit under a \"quantum gate\"\u2014where the spin of each electron represents the computational state. For example, spin up may represent a 0 and spin down could represent a 1. Each qubit can then be controlled by an oscillating magnetic field of microwave frequency.\nBut to implement a quantum algorithm, we also need two-qubit gates, where the control of one qubit is conditional on the state of the other. For this to work, both quantum dots need to be placed very closely, just a few 10s of nanometers apart so their spins can interact with one another. (To put this in perspective, a single human hair is about 100,000 nanometers thick.)\nBut moving them further apart to create more real estate for wiring has always been the challenge facing scientists and engineers. The problem was as the paired qubits move apart, they would then stop interacting.\nThe jellybean solution represents a way of having both: nicely spaced qubits that continue to influence one another. To make the jellybean, the engineers found a way to create a chain of electrons by trapping more electrons in between the qubits. This acts as the quantum version of a string phone so that the two paired qubit electrons at each end of the jellybean can continue to talk to another. Only the electrons at each end are involved in any computations, while the electrons in the jellybean dot are there to keep them interacting while spread apart.\nThe lead author of the paper, former Ph.D. student Zeheng Wang says the number of extra electrons pulled into the jellybean quantum dot is key to how they arrange themselves.\n\"We showed in the paper that if you only load a few electrons in that puddle of electrons that you have underneath, they break into smaller puddles. So it's not one continuous jellybean quantum dot, it's a smaller one here, and a bigger one in the middle and a smaller one there. We're talking of a total of three to maybe ten electrons.\n\"It's only when you go to larger numbers of electrons, say 15 or 20 electrons, that the jellybean becomes more continuous and homogeneous. And that's where you have your well-defined spin and quantum states that you can use to couple qubits to another.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nPost-jellybean quantum world\nA/Prof. Laucht stresses that there is still much work to be done. The team's efforts for this paper focused on proving the jellybean quantum dot is possible. The next step is to insert working qubits at each end of the jellybean quantum dot and make them talk to another.\n\"It is great to see this work realized. It boosts our confidence that jellybean couplers can be utilized in silicon quantum computers, and we are excited to try implementing them with qubits next.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tZeheng Wang et al, Jellybean Quantum Dots in Silicon for Qubit Coupling and On\u2010Chip Quantum Chemistry, Advanced Materials (2023).

Based on laser-matter interactions, via judiciously selecting the appropriate laser processing parameters, a variety of innovative flexible sensors, such as physical, chemical and physiological sensors have been demonstrated.\nThe typical strategies usually rely on the laser direct writing of electrodes, followed by the deposition of moisture sensitive nanomaterials, such as carbon or metal sulfides-based materials, on the top of electrodes. However, this leads to multiple complex procedures. Therefore, a facile and simple approach to developing thin film-based humidity sensor is still required.\n\n\n\n\n\n                (a) Photos of a humidity sensor on a commercial mask worn on the subject\u2019s face.

It separates the incoming letters into various output colors that the physicists can identify using a spectrometer. They have also demonstrated a complete, high-dimensional mQPG-based decoder that enables encryption protocols based on individual photons. \"The versatility of mQPG makes it a valuable resource for numerous applications in quantum communications, and also opens up other opportunities for all technologies based on temporal modes,\" Brecht notes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLaura Serino et al, Realization of a Multi-Output Quantum Pulse Gate for Decoding High-Dimensional Temporal Modes of Single-Photon States, PRX Quantum (2023).

What's special about this experiment is that the researchers were able for the first time to perform it using superconducting circuits, which are considered to be promising candidates for building powerful quantum computers.\nAn old dispute\nA Bell test is based on an experimental setup that was initially devised as a thought experiment by British physicist John Bell in the 1960s. Bell wanted to settle a question that the greats of physics had already argued about in the 1930s: Are the predictions of quantum mechanics, which run completely counter to everyday intuition, correct, or do the conventional concepts of causality also apply in the atomic microcosm, as Albert Einstein believed?\nTo answer this question, Bell proposed to perform a random measurement on two entangled particles at the same time and check it against Bell's inequality. If Einstein's concept of local causality is true, these experiments will always satisfy Bell's inequality. By contrast, quantum mechanics predicts that they will violate it.\nThe last doubts dispelled\nIn the early 1970s, John Francis Clauser, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics last year, and Stuart Freedman carried out a first practical Bell test. In their experiments, the two researchers were able to prove that Bell's inequality is indeed violated. But they had to make certain assumptions in their experiments to be able to conduct them in the first place. So, theoretically, it might still have been the case that Einstein was correct to be skeptical of quantum mechanics.\nOver time, however, more and more of these loopholes could be closed. Finally, in 2015, various groups succeeded in conducting the first truly loophole-free Bell tests, thus finally settling the old dispute.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nPromising applications\nWallraff's group can now confirm these results with a novel experiment. The work by the ETH researchers published in Nature shows that research on this topic is not concluded, despite the initial confirmation seven years ago. There are several reasons for this.\nFor one thing, the ETH researchers' experiment confirms that superconducting circuits operate according to the laws of quantum mechanics too, even though they are much bigger than microscopic quantum objects such as photons or ions. The several hundred micrometer-sized electronic circuits made of superconducting materials and operated at microwave frequencies are referred to as macroscopic quantum objects.\nFor another thing, Bell tests also have a practical significance. \"Modified Bell tests can be used in cryptography, for example, to demonstrate that information is actually transmitted in encrypted form,\" explains Simon Storz, a doctoral student in Wallraff's group. \"With our approach, we can prove much more efficiently than is possible in other experimental setups that Bell's inequality is violated. That makes it particularly interesting for practical applications.\"\nThe search for a compromise\nHowever, the researchers need a sophisticated test facility for this. Because for the Bell test to be truly loophole-free, they must ensure that no information can be exchanged between the two entangled circuits before the quantum measurements are complete. Since the fastest that information can be transmitted is at the speed of light, the measurement must take less time than it takes a light particle to travel from one circuit to another.\nSo, when setting up the experiment, it's important to strike a balance: the greater the distance between the two superconducting circuits, the more time is available for the measurement\u2014and the more complex the experimental setup becomes. This is because the entire experiment must be conducted in a vacuum near absolute zero.\nThe ETH researchers have determined the shortest distance over which to perform a successful loophole-free Bell test to be around 33 meters, as it takes a light particle about 110 nanoseconds to travel this distance in a vacuum. That's a few nanoseconds more than it took the researchers to perform the experiment.\nThirty-meter vacuum\nWallraff's team has built an impressive facility in the underground passageways of the ETH campus. At each of its two ends is a cryostat containing a superconducting circuit. These two cooling apparatuses are connected by a 30-meter-long tube whose interior is cooled to a temperature just above absolute zero (\u2013273.15\u00b0C).\nBefore the start of each measurement, a microwave photon is transmitted from one of the two superconducting circuits to the other so that the two circuits become entangled. Random number generators then decide which measurements are made on the two circuits as part of the Bell test. Next, the measurement results on both sides are compared.\nLarge-scale entanglement\nAfter evaluating more than one million measurements, the researchers have shown with very high statistical certainty that Bell's inequality is violated in this experimental setup. In other words, they have confirmed that quantum mechanics also allows for non-local correlations in macroscopic electrical circuits and consequently that superconducting circuits can be entangled over a large distance. This opens up interesting possible applications in the field of distributed quantum computing and quantum cryptography.\nBuilding the facility and carrying out the test was a challenge, Wallraff says. Just cooling the entire experimental setup to a temperature close to absolute zero takes considerable effort.\n\"There are 1.3 tons of copper and 14,000 screws in our machine, as well as a great deal of physics knowledge and engineering know-how,\" Wallraff says. He believes that it would in principle be possible to build facilities that overcome even greater distances in the same way. This technology could, for instance, be used to connect superconducting quantum computers over great distances.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSimon Storz, Loophole-free Bell inequality violation with superconducting circuits, Nature (2023).

Therefore, pressure can be an effective method to enhance the photoelectric performance of PbI2.\nIn this study, the high-pressure absorption spectra of PbI2 suggested that the electrical band was closed at the transition point, while the charge transport indicated that the sample remained non-metallic. The non-metallic transport was well explained by the development of a semi-metallic phase at high pressure, as determined by first-principles calculations of the photocurrent spurt and infrared band response.\nThe semiconductor\u2013semi-metal transition in PbI2 was further confirmed by the remarkable decrease in lifetime to a few picoseconds in ultrafast spectroscopy under pressure.

They use the technique of multiphoton lithography to print inside an existing porous material with high intensity laser light.\nThis allows the researchers to selectively modify regions of the interior and manufacture custom small-scale optical devices in a procedure called subsurface controllable refractive index via beam exposure, or SCRIBE. The two research groups recently announced a refinement to this procedure that gives them significantly tighter control over the resulting devices. The new procedure was recently published in ACS Photonics.\n\"We were able to show an improvement from a baseline of 36% to a new value of 49% in the efficiency of fabricated lenses and a clear improvement in the color uniformity resulting from the 2D line gratings we made,\" said Alexander Littlefield, a graduate student in Goddard's group and the study's lead author. \"We believe that this new technique will open the door to a vast array of optical element designs.\"\nSCRIBE is a form of multiphoton lithography that depends on a mechanism called two-photon absorption. The researchers use silicon that has been etched to have microscopic pores and oxidized into transparent silica. They then fill it with a material called photoresist, which can undergo a chemical process by which it changes its optical properties only when it absorbs two photons simultaneously\u2014a process that is quite rare unless very intense light is used.\nThe researchers take advantage of this by focusing laser light to create high intensities only in specific regions. This allows them to create custom designs for the material's optical properties in three dimensions to \"write\" optical components.\nPast versions of SCRIBE were limited by imperfect control of the laser's intensity. To address this, the researchers present three improvements to the technique in their article.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, they use a two-photon fluorescence imaging system to map the photoresist's density and correct the laser power needed for the desired result. Second, they smooth out errors that are especially prominent near the writing boundary by modulating the material's position as the laser writes. Finally, they introduce a time delay between laser exposures to minimize time-dependent effects in the photoresist interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n                A line grating fabricated with SCRIBE to form the UIUC \u201cI\u201d logo with accurate colors.

To demonstrate the versatility of their method, they fabricated a 100-by-100-micrometer optical device that alters light to form specific color patterns, a line grating, that reproduces the shape and colors of the UIUC logo.\n\"Our work shows that multiphoton lithography can now accurately fabricate microscale optical components with new capabilities that do not yet exist for other fabrication methods,\" Goddard said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexander J.

   "text": "An international collaboration of researchers, including the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (Kavli IPMU) has succeeded in a proof-of-principle experiment to verify strong-field quantum electrodynamics with exotic atoms, by performing high-precision measurements of the energy spectrum of muonic characteristic X-rays emitted from muonic atoms using a state-of-the-art X-ray detector, reports a new study in Physical Review Letters.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group's results are a significant step toward verifying fundamental physical laws under strong electric fields, which humankind has not yet been able to create artificially. The highly efficient and accurate X-ray energy determination method using state-of-the-art quantum technology demonstrated in this research is expected to be applied to various research fields, such as non-destructive elemental analysis methods using muonic atoms.\nIt has always been a dream of scientists to discover physical laws. They have been found or proposed to explain observed phenomena that cannot be understood by existing theories. In many cases, the discovery of new physics requires the development of new experimental techniques and improved accuracy of measurements. The most precisely tested theory of physical laws is Quantum ElectroDynamics (QED), which describes the microscopic interactions between charged particles and light. Scientists are constantly pushing the limits of how far QED accurately describes our physical reality.\nIn this paper, the collaboration injected a low-velocity negative muon beam from the J-PARC facility into neon gas, and the energy of characteristic X-rays emitted from the resulting muonic neon (Ne) atoms was precisely measured using a superconducting Transition-Edge Sensor (TES) detector. By taking full advantage of the excellent energy resolution of the TES detector, the energy of the muonic characteristic X-rays was determined with an absolute uncertainty of less than 1/10,000, and contributions from vacuum polarization in strong-field quantum electrodynamics were successfully verified with a high precision of 5.8 %.\nThe TES detector was originally developed for space X-ray observation. Takahashi's current project at Kavli IPMU has been to carry out unprecedented cross-disciplinary research using this detector. His team includes Kavli IPMU Project Assistant Professor Shin'ichiro Takeda, Project Researcher Miho Katsuragawa, and at-the-tune graduate student Kairi Mine, who took part in the muon experiments.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe collaboration's demonstration of the experimental technique using muonic atoms is expected to lead to a great leap forward in the study of QED verification under strong electric fields.\nDetails of the study are published in the journal Physical Review Letters.\nThe effects of QED are more pronounced in environments with strong electric fields, but theoretical calculations become more difficult in this case. Therefore, a strong electric field environment is very important for QED verification. For many years, experiments using highly charged ions (HCIs), which are atoms stripped of multiple electrons, have been conducted as an approach to realize a strong electric field environment.\nThe electric field felt by the bound electrons in HCIs becomes stronger as the atomic number becomes larger, and the shielding effect is suppressed by the stripping of many electrons. HCI research using large accelerators is still vigorously pursued. However, even for HCIs with large atomic numbers, the effect of the finite size of the nucleus cannot be ignored. It has been pointed out that this effect is not precisely known, and thus the accuracy of QED verification, which compares experimental results with theory, is greatly compromised.\nTo verify QED under strong electric fields in a different way than with HCIs, international research groups have focused on \"exotic atoms,\" in which a negatively charged particle is bound to the nucleus instead of the electron. Among the variety of exotic atoms, muonic atoms are composed of negative muons (elementary particles about 200 times heavier than electrons) and nuclei.\nNegative muons can nowadays be extracted as beams from large accelerators. Muonic atoms are characterized by the extremely close proximity of the negative muon to the nucleus, with the orbital radius of a bound muon being approximately 1/200th that of a bound electron.\nAs a result, the electric field felt by the muon is about 40,000 times stronger than the electric field felt by a bound electron of the same quantum level in an HCI, resulting in a huge QED effect. In addition, by using negative muons, which occupy high angular momentum quantum levels with small overlap with the nucleus, it is possible to conduct experiments in which the effect of the finite size of the nucleus is largely suppressed. By precisely measuring the energy of muonic characteristic X-rays emitted when muonic atoms are deexcited from a specific level to lower levels, QED can be verified under a strong electric field (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n                Figure 1. Conceptual diagram showing muonic atoms and quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects. In a muonic atom, the negative muon (\u03bc^-) is bound to the nucleus and orbits around it. According to quantum electrodynamics, the bound negative muon continues its orbital motion while repeatedly emitting and absorbing virtual photons (self-energy: SE ). In addition, there is an electrostatic attraction between the neon nucleus (Ne^10+) and the negative muon, and the photons propagating through this interaction continuously repeat the creation and annihilation of virtual electron-positron (e^\u00b1) pairs (vacuum polarization: VP ). In this study, we precisely measured the energy of muonic characteristic X-rays emitted when the negative muon deexcites to a lower state.\u00a0Credit: Okumura et al\n             \n\n\nThus, muonic atoms are a promising experimental target for strong-field QED verification. However, there are several problems to overcome. The largest is that a number of muonic atoms must be prepared in an isolated environment. The presence of atoms or molecules in the vicinity of the muonic atoms may cause rapid electron transfer and changes the energy of the muonic characteristic X-rays. The solution is to use dilute gas targets with a small number density (low pressure), but the number of produced muonic atoms and the resulting intensity of muonic characteristic X-rays are reduced.\nThe international research group conducted experiments at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) in Tokai-mura, Ibaraki, where the world's most intense low-velocity muon beam is available. In order to determine the energy with sufficient accuracy even with low-intensity muonic characteristic X-rays, the experiment was conducted with a superconducting transition edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeter, which is a highly efficient and high-resolution X-ray detector.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Figure 2. Spectrum of emitted muonic characteristic X-rays emitted from muonic neon atoms (a) Muonic characteristic X-rays emitted from muonic neon atoms appearing around 6300 eV at a neon gas target pressure of 0.1 atm. This peak is formed by the superposition of six different transitions. The peak energy was determined to an accuracy of 0.002% by fitting with respect to each contribution. (b) The residuals (difference between theoretical and measured values) from the fitting. The residuals are sufficiently small, indicating that the fitting was done with high accuracy.\u00a0Credit: Okumura et al\n             \n\n\nUsing rare gas neon (10Ne) atoms as the target, they have achieved an energy resolution that is one order of magnitude higher than that of conventional semiconductor detectors (FWHM [11]: 5.2 eV) under dilute conditions of 0.1 atm and successfully measured the muonic characteristic X-rays (Figure 2). The peaks shown are mainly due to the overlap of muonic characteristic X-rays from six different transitions, and the energy of the muonic characteristic X-rays was determined to a high accuracy of 0.002% by analyzing contributions from each of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Figure 3. Dependence of muonic characteristic X-ray energy on neon gas pressure and comparison with the latest theoretical calculation.\u00a0Credit: Okumura et al\n             \n\n\nThey repeated the measurements while changing the pressure of the neon gas target (Figure 3) and confirmed that the energy of the muonic X-rays is constant within experimental error regardless of the pressure of the neon gas target.\nThus, it can be concluded that the muonic neon atoms were in an isolated environment. They compared the latest theoretical calculations with the experimental results and confirmed that they agreed within the experimental error. The researchers succeeded in verifying the effect of vacuum polarization under a strong electric field with an extremely high accuracy of 5.8%. This is comparable to the accuracy of strong-field QED using the multiply charged uranium ion U91+, which is the most accurate observation to date.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tT.

If this pair then strongly couples to a photon, a hybrid particle known as an exciton\u2013polariton can form.\n\n\n\n\n\n                FLEET Research Fellows and ANU researchers: from left Dr Eliezer Estrecho, Dr Matthias Wurdack, Dr Tinghe Yun. Credit: Phil Dooley ANU\n             \n\n\nExciton\u2013polaritons were first observed more than 30 years ago and have been shown to exhibit remarkable properties, including superfluidity and formation of Bose-Einstein condensates. Around the world a number of research groups are exploring the counter-intuitive behavior of these strange particles in the hope they could underpin future low-energy technologies.\nThe observation of negative mass sent the scientists, from the group of Professor Elena Ostrovskaya, back to the whiteboard to try to work out what could cause such an effect.\nThe simplicity of the experiment, a monolayer of tungsten disulfide integrated in a microcavity, meant that it could be approximated with a simple coupled-oscillator model and so left few possibilities for unexpected effects. The team soon realized that an imaginary coupling constant, called dissipative coupling, in their calculations replicated their observations.\nHowever, they struggled to make sense of the mathematical model, until they looked at other fields, such as microwave cavities, and realized that an imaginary coupling constant could equate to losses from the light-matter system.\nTo confirm that interpretation, the team reached out to experts in numerical modeling of physics in two-dimensional systems, led by Professor Andreas Knorr from Technical University of Berlin in Germany. Manuel Katzer and Dr. Malte Selig from his team were able to confirm that the negative mass could arise from losses\u2014specifically due to interactions between exciton\u2013polaritons and phonons in the atomically-thin semiconductor.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe calculations also showed that as the exciton\u2013phonon interactions were turned off, the mass went from positive to negative, behavior that subsequent experiments at ANU reproduced. The results are now published in Nature Communications.\nDr. Wurdack likened the behavior of exciton\u2013polaritons to that of boats on a lake.\n\"The phonons in the active material are like waves on the lake which can affect the movement of the boats\u2014redirecting them, causing them to sway and capsize. This reduces their kinetic energies, which overall leads to losses in momentum, energy and occupation numbers,\" he said.\nIn the quest for low-energy technology, scientists go to great lengths to reduce or remove losses, said Dr. Estrecho, also from FLEET.\n\"Typically, we don't want losses, but here losses have given us something new,\" he said. \"It enabled us to introduce a negative mass to the strongly coupled system.\"\nThe discovery is another facet of exciton\u2013polaritons' counter-intuitive behavior, Dr. Wurdack said.\n\"This behavior could be used for dispersion engineering, potentially to probe new physics and create as yet undreamed-of devices. I cannot predict the extent of future applications yet using this kind of dispersion engineering, but I am hopeful this will be explored in future research activities,\" he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tM.

In this new effort, the researchers have looked to anyons for help.\nAnyons are quasiparticles that exist in two dimensions. They are not true particles, but instead exist as vibrations that act like particles\u2014certain groups of them are called nonabelions. Prior research has found that nonabelions have a unique and useful property\u2014they remember some of their own history. This property makes them potentially useful for creating less error-prone quantum computers. But creating, manipulating and doing useful things with them in a quantum computer is challenging. In this new work, the team have come close by creating a physical simulation of nonabelions in action.\nThe research involved building a quantum computer based on a chip that produces electric fields that can trap ytterbium ions, which are then used to represent qubits. In their design, the trapped ions could be moved around, allowing them to interact if desired. They used this characteristic to entangle 32 ions in a lattice in the form of a kagome, all of which shared the same quantum state. Additional manipulation put the kagome in an excited state that allowed for simulating particles with properties of nonabelions.\nThe team then tested their machine to ensure the simulated nonabelions performed just as real ones would do under the same conditions\u2014one such test involved moving the nonabelions to create Borromean rings\u2014and that, the team suggests, showed that they might be used to overcome the need for much of the error correction normally involved in quantum computers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMohsin Iqbal et al, Creation of Non-Abelian Topological Order and Anyons on a Trapped-Ion Processor, arXiv (2023).

Experimental physicist Makariy Tanatar of Ames National Laboratory at Iowa State University noticed perplexing electronic behavior in layered helimagnetic crystals and brought the mystery to the attention of Rice theoretical physicist Andriy Nevidomskyy, who worked with Tanatar and former Rice graduate student Matthew Butcher to create a computational model that simulated the quantum states of atoms and electrons in the layered materials.\nMagnetic materials undergo a \"thawing\" transition as they warm up and become nonmagnetic. The researchers ran thousands of Monte Carlo computer simulations of this transition in helimagnets and observed how the magnetic dipoles of atoms inside the material arranged themselves during the thaw. Their results were published in a recent study in Physical Review Letters.\nAt a submicroscopic level, the materials under study are composed of thousands of 2D crystals stacked one atop another like pages in a notebook. In each crystal sheet, atoms are arrayed in lattices, and the physicists modeled quantum interactions both within and between sheets.\n\"We're used to thinking that if you take a solid, like a block of ice, and you heat it up, eventually it will become a liquid, and at a higher temperature, it will evaporate and become a gas,\" said Nevidomskyy, an associate professor of physics and astronomy and member of the Rice Quantum Initiative. \"A similar analogy can be made with magnetic materials, except that nothing evaporates in a true sense of the word.\"\n\"The crystal is still intact,\" he said. \"But if you look at the arrangement of the little magnetic dipoles\u2014which are like compass needles\u2014they start out in a correlated arrangement, meaning that if you know which way one of them is pointing, you can determine which way any of them points, regardless how far away it is in the lattice. That is the magnetic state\u2014the solid in our analogy. As you heat up, the dipoles eventually will become completely independent, or random, with respect to one another. That's known as a paramagnet, and it is analogous to a gas.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nNevidomskyy said physicists typically think of materials either having magnetic order or lacking it.\n\"A better analogy from the classical viewpoint would be a block of dry ice,\" he said. \"It kind of forgets about the liquid phase and goes straight from ice into gas. That's what magnetic transitions are usually like in the textbooks. We are taught that you start with something correlated, let's say a ferromagnet, and at some point the order parameter disappears, and you end up with a paramagnet.\"\nTanatar, a research scientist at Ames' Superconductivity and Magnetism Low-Temperature Laboratory, had found signs that the transition from magnetic order to disorder in helical magnets was marked by a transitory phase in which electronic properties, like resistance, differed by direction. For instance, they might differ if they were measured horizontally, from side to side, as opposed to vertically from top to bottom. This directional behavior, which physicists call anisotropy, is a hallmark of many quantum materials like high-temperature superconductors.\n\"These layered materials don't look the same in the vertical and horizontal directions,\" said Nevidomskyy. \"That's the anisotropy. Makariy's intuition was that anisotropy was affecting how magnetism melts in the material, and our modeling demonstrated that to be true and showed why it happens.\"\nThe model showed that the material passes through an intermediate phase as it transitions from magnetic order to disorder. In that phase, dipole interactions are much stronger within sheets than between them. Moreover, the correlations between the dipoles resembled those of a liquid, rather than a solid. The result is \"flattened puddles of magnetic liquids that are stacked up like pancakes,\" Nevidomskyy said. In each puddle-like pancake, dipoles point roughly in the same direction, but that sense of direction varies between neighboring pancakes.\n\"It's a bunch of atoms all with their dipoles pointing in the same direction,\" Nevidomskyy said. \"But then, if you go up one layer, all of them are pointing in a different random direction.\"\nThe atomic arrangement in the material \"frustrates\" the dipoles and keeps them from aligning in a uniform direction throughout the material. Instead, the dipoles in the layers shift, rotating slightly in response to changes in neighboring pancakes.\n\"Frustrations make it difficult for the arrows, these magnetic dipoles, to decide where they want to point, at one angle or another,\" Nevidomskyy said. \"And to relieve that frustration, they tend to rotate and shift in each layer.\"\nTanatar said, \"The idea is that you have two competing magnetic phases. They are fighting each other, and as a result you have a transition temperature for these phases that is lower than it would be without competition. And in this competition scenario, the phenomena that lead to magnetic order are different from the phenomena when you don't have this competition.\"\nTanatar and Nevidomskyy said that while there's no immediate application for the discovery, it may nevertheless offer hints about the still-unexplained physics of other anisotropic materials like high-temperature superconductors.\nDespite the name, high-temperature superconductivity occurs at very cold temperatures. One theory suggests that materials may become superconductors when they are cooled in the vicinity of a quantum critical point, a temperature sufficient to suppress long-range magnetic order and give rise to effects brought about by strong quantum fluctuations. For example, several magnetic \"parent\" materials have been shown to harbor superconductivity close to a quantum critical point where magnetism disappears.\n\"Once you suppress the main effect, the long-range magnetic ordering, you may give way to weaker effects like superconductivity,\" Tanatar said. \"This is one of the leading theories of unconventional superconductivity.

   "text": "Cameras used in harsh environments must be designed in a way that prevents temperature swings from influencing their optical performance. New research demonstrates that accounting for the exact lens mounting structure used is a critical step in ensuring that lens systems remain robust to temperature changes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEric M. Schiesser from Synopsys, Inc. will present the new research at the Optica Design and Fabrication Conference, which will take place June 4\u20138 2023 in Quebec City, Canada.\n\"Most optical systems\u2014from the camera in your smartphone to the eyes of the Mars rover\u2014are used over a range of temperatures. To keep the image sharp over the changing temperature, optical engineers can fine-tune the details of the optical and mechanical designs so that the thermal effects balance each other. Everyone involved in the manufacture of these passively athermalized optical systems should appreciate how interwoven the mounting structure is to the optical prescription, which is the thrust of our design study,\" said the research team.\nBoth the glass used to make lenses and the materials used to make the mounts that hold lenses are sensitive to changes in temperature, which can make optical systems lose focus when temperatures rise or fall. However, it is possible to reduce variations in optical performance over a range of temperatures using a process called athermalization, which achieves optothermal stability by incorporating several materials with different thermal properties.\nIn the new work, the researchers focused on using passive athermalization to mitigate thermal effects. This involved designing the lens system and mounting structure so that the thermal shift of the optimal focal plane matched the mechanical shift of the focal plane array used as the detector in the camera.\nTo illustrate the importance of accounting for lens mounting details, they performed athermalization for the same camera lens using two different lens mount structures. They first analyzed the thermal behavior for a seat model in which the lenses are held against seats integrated into the mounting structure or housing. In this case, the mounting structure itself provides the connection between the seats, which means that the thermal expansion of one element doesn't affect the position of any other element.\nThe researchers athermalized the seat model lens across a given temperature range by changing the surface shapes, element thicknesses, lens separations and lens materials. Then, they re-analyzed it using a spacer-based mounting approach. In a spacer-based housing concept the lens system is a stack of lenses and spacers. For a given temperature increase, glass will expand less than most materials used as spacers, which means that the expansion of the spacers will create a greater effect than the expansion of the lenses themselves.\nA performance comparison for the different lens mount configurations showed that when the mounting method was changed, the focal plane array became out of sync with the optimal image plane because the lens elements don't respond to temperature changes in the same way. The researchers note that this performance degradation in is not inherent to a spacer-based mounting structure. If the original athermalization was carried out assuming spacers, switching to seats would also degrade the performance.\nOverall, the study shows the importance of accounting for the specific mounting structure used when performing passive athermalization and that changing the mounting characteristics after athermalization will likely lead to poor thermal stability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOptica\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDesigning cameras for harsh environments?

   "text": "The National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) has achieved a tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of 631% at room temperature, breaking the previous world record, which had stood for 15 years.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research team accomplished this by fine-tuning the interfaces in a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). This MTJ exhibited very large TMR ratio oscillation effect with a peak-to-valley (PV) difference of 141%. This phenomenon may be exploitable to significantly increase the sensitivity of magnetic sensors and the capacity of magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM).\nThis research was published online in Applied Physics Letters.\nTunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) is a dramatic change in the tunneling current in an MTJ\u2014which consists of two ferromagnets separated by a thin insulator\u2014when the relative magnetizations of the two ferromagnetic layers change in alignment. This effect has been used in highly sensitive, tiny magnetic sensors and energy-efficient MRAM.\nSensor sensitivity and MRAM density can both be increased by using MTJs capable of producing larger TMR ratios (i.e., differences in electrical resistance generated by an MTJ when the magnetization orientation of its two ferromagnets switches between parallel and antiparallel).\nA room-temperature TMR ratio of 604% recorded in 2008 had remained as the world record until recently. Because this record stood out for years, it had been widely believed that little room for improvement remained in magnetic sensor and MRAM performance.\nThis NIMS research team recently broke this TMR ratio record by precisely controlling interfaces in an MTJ consisting of two thin magnetic layers separated by a thin insulation layer. The team made atomic-scale modifications to the MTJ, including the fabrication of all of its layer components from single crystals and the addition of an ultrathin metallic magnesium layer between the magnetic and insulation layers. As a result, the team was able to create an MTJ with a maximum TMR ratio of 631%.\nIn addition, the TMR ratio of this MTJ was found to oscillate with a PV difference of 141%\u2014significantly greater than the PV difference of existing MTJs (up to a few dozen percent). This result was consistent with the previous finding that the oscillation PV difference of a TMR ratio is greatly influenced by the thickness of the insulation layer.\nIn future research, the team will work to shed light on the poorly understood relationship between TMR ratios and their oscillation PV difference by investigating the mechanisms behind the large PV difference observed in this research. This understanding may enable the team to break its own room-temperature TMR ratio world record.\nUsing this breakthrough result, the team will work to accelerate the development of ultrasensitive magnetic sensors for medical use and very large capacity MRAM.\nThis project was carried out by a research team led by Thomas Scheike (Special Researcher, Research Center for Magnetic and Spintronic Materials (CMSM), NIMS) and Hiroaki Sukegawa (Group Leader, CMSM, NIMS).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThomas Scheike et al, 631% room temperature tunnel magnetoresistance with large oscillation effect in CoFe/MgO/CoFe(001) junctions, Applied Physics Letters (2023).

   "text": "The precision of obtaining abundant light-matter-interact information with a snapshot measurement makes optical spectroscopy indispensable for modern industries and scientific research. The miniaturization of traditionally bulky spectrometers has been strongly motivated by the vast applications, including bio/medical sensing, material analysis, optical communication, and light source characterization.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers have been engineering spectrometers for lower cost, higher flexibilities, smaller size, better stabilities, and performances for quite some time. However, an inherent trade-off between the above aspects constrains this long-term theme of miniaturization from advancing. Generally, spectrometers with dispersive elements require extra spatial separations and tend to leave a large footprint.\nFilters (including narrowband and reconstructive types) based designs suffer from power loss caused by either absorption or reflection and limited resolution and bandwidth due to limited channel numbers. On-chip spectrometers rely on nanofabrication and tend to have very low coupling efficiency for wideband operation.\nAbove all, a flexible and low-cost tiny spectrometer with stable high performance is still elusive.\nIn a new paper published in eLight, a team of scientists led by Professor Yaoguang Ma from Zhejiang University have developed a compact spectrometer that integrates multiple taper tips for hyperspectral imaging.\nThe spectrometer utilizes complex leaky modes speckles projected from a curved microfiber taper tip that uniquely determines the wavelength of the input signal. By solid packaging with a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) imaging sensor, the data acquisition of our spectrometer can be finished using a single snapshot with no external equipment needed.\nA lightweight vision transformer (ViT) network was used for analyzing the complex frames recorded by the CMOS image sensor (CIS). The correlation between the spectral information and leaky mode images can be easily constructed after training. In addition, this tiny high-performance device is fabricated with low-cost elements (the core components of the spectrometer cost less than US$15). It could be used over long intervals while maintaining accuracy and reliability.\nMultimode interferences could generate random speckles which are associated with spectra information. However, most spectrometer designs based on it rely on random mediums such as rough surfaces, multimode fiber, integrating spheres, or photonic crystals. These usually require additional bulky or expensive equipment, such as a high-performance camera or even a microscope, to complete the measurement.\nOn the other hand, microfibers are ideal tools for manipulating light fields of their tailorable dispersion and small footprint. Experiments usually use microfibers for confining light inside the fiber to propagate as long as possible. If a microfiber taper is drawn under non-adiabatic conditions, coupling between different mode induced by the fiber geometry will generate leaky modes that are typically undesired for microfiber applications.\nHowever, researchers from Zhejiang University managed to utilize the leaky mode by studying the induced random speckles to recover the hidden spectral information, while engineering the drawing conditions of the taper to maximize the leaky modes generation within a 1 mm taper region. The spectrometer can operate within 0.3-1 mm region. An ~1.5 pm resolution can be achieved with a snapshot measurement.\nThe demonstrated low-cost, scalable spectrometer also can be implemented at scale on one CIS chip to demonstrate hyperspectral imaging. The high agreement between data from the proposed microtaper hyperspectral imager and data from the conventional spectrometer shows great potential for their design.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQingqing Cen et al, Microtaper leaky-mode spectrometer with picometer resolution, eLight (2023).

   "text": "Espresso coffee is brewed by first grinding roasted coffee beans into grains. Hot water then forces its way through a bed of coffee grains at high pressure, and the soluble content of the coffee grains dissolves into the water (extraction) to produce espresso.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, researchers found that more finely ground coffee beans brew a weaker espresso. This counterintuitive experimental result makes sense if, for some reason, regions exist within the coffee bed where less or even no coffee is extracted. This uneven extraction becomes more pronounced when coffee is ground more finely.\nIn Physics of Fluids, University of Huddersfield researchers explored the role of uneven coffee extraction using a simple mathematical model. They split the coffee into two regions to examine whether uneven flow does in fact make weaker espresso.\nOne of the regions in the model system hosted more tightly packed coffee than the other, which caused an initial disparity in flow resistance because water flows more quickly through more tightly packed grains. The extraction of coffee decreased the flow resistance further, as coffee grains lose about 20% to 25% of their mass during the process.\n\"Our model shows that flow and extraction widened the initial disparity in flow between the two regions due to a positive feedback loop, in which more flow leads to more extraction, which in turn reduces resistance and leads to more flow,\" said co-author William Lee. \"This effect appears to always be active, and it isn't until one of the regions has all of its soluble coffee extracted that we see the experimentally observed decrease in extraction with decreasing grind size.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                In this figure, Q is the rate of flow, epsilon is the porosity (which increases as coffee is extracted), and c is the concentration of dissolved coffee (a measure of the strength of the espresso).

Arshad\n             \n\n\nThe researchers were surprised to find the model always predicts uneven flow across different parts of the coffee bed.\n\"This is important because the taste of the coffee depends on the level of extraction,\" said Lee. \"Too little extraction and the taste of the coffee is what experts call 'underdeveloped,' or as I describe it: smoky water. Too much extraction and the coffee tastes very bitter. These results suggest that even if it looks like the overall extraction is at the right level, it might be due to a mixture of underdeveloped and bitter coffee.\"\nUnderstanding the origin of uneven extraction and avoiding or preventing it could enable better brews and substantial financial savings by using coffee more efficiently.\n\"Our next step is to make the model more realistic to see if we can obtain more detailed insights into this confusing phenomenon,\" said Lee. \"Once this is achieved, we can start to think about whether it is possible to make changes to the way espresso coffee is brewed to reduce the amount of uneven extraction.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWilliam Lee et al, Uneven Extraction in Coffee Brewing, Physics of Fluids (2023).

To ensure high performance of the supercell at all three wavelengths and six polarization channels, the periodic geometrical parameters of the supercell are optimized by a particle swarm-genetic algorithm and, thus, achieving arbitrary polarization modulation in multiple wavelength dimensions.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe joint research team has prepared a representative polychromatic full-polarization control metadevice and demonstrated the generation of achromatically focusing spots over three pairs of arbitrarily chosen orthogonal polarizations on spatially separated channels at three wavelengths. It mimics the function of cascading filter, polarizer and wave plate placed in parallel in conventional setups.\nThree different pairs of orthogonal polarization states at three wavelengths are linear polarization at 3.0 \u03bcm, elliptical polarization (ellipse angle 30\u00b0) at 3.6 \u03bcm and circular polarization at 4.5 \u03bcm. Though the method is based on the wavelength-decoupled coherent pixel, each with only four conventional linear EPS metaatoms, it still works at multiple wavelengths and the form of polarization states are arbitrary. As an example, a ten-channel metadevice is realized as illustrated in Figure 2. The selected five pairs of orthogonal polarization states are shown in the Poincar\u00e9 sphere, which agrees well with the design.\nThe joint research team has demonstrated the eigen-polarization engineering through theoretical analysis, simulations and experimental measurements. It broadens the polarization applications from scientific research to industry in an ultra-compact and integrated manner, which would require various cascaded elements in parallel otherwise.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJin Chen et al, Polychromatic full-polarization control in mid-infrared light, Light: Science & Applications (2023).

   "text": "The way light moves around inside an optical microcavity provides an exciting opportunity to explore the connection between classical and quantum physics.

Studying the topological properties of microcavities can give us valuable insights into the behavior of different chaotic systems, helping us better understand the universe we live in.\nIn a new paper published in Light: Science & Applications, a team of scientists led by Dr. Chang-Hwan Yi from the Center for Theoretical Physics of Complex Systems, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Republic of Korea, Prof. Hee Chul Park from the Department of Physics, Pukyong National University (PKNU), Republic of Korea, and Prof. Moon Jip Park from the Department of Physics, Hanyang University (HYU), Republic of Korea has made a significant breakthrough in the field of wave chaos research. Their recent study unveils a new platform for studying dynamical localization transitions in periodic cavity arrays. The research team explored the wave chaos of deformed optical microcavities coupled to crystalline momentum in a periodic cavity array, i.e., scar-momentum locking.\nBy controlling the crystalline momentum, they observed dynamical localization transitions and found that the Bloch momentum can substitute the role of boundary shape deformation. The team also proposed the possibility of realizing Berry curvature-induced transport phenomena that utilize the intrinsic wave property of chaotic states. The crossover between Rayleigh and Mie regimes of Berry curvature-induced transport could pioneer a new aspect of wave-particle correspondence in wave chaos.\nThe recent breakthrough in studying wave chaos phenomena provides a valuable tool for manipulating the behavior of light waves in periodic structures. Dr. Chang-Hwan Yi notes, \"Our work offers a new avenue for studying wave chaos phenomena and opens up possibilities for discoveries in the field.\"\nWith potential implications in quantum information and communication, as well as the development of new optoelectronic devices, this breakthrough could provide the way for future technological advancements.

The engineers' method involves applying an electric field to a two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting material. Their findings appear in Nature Photonics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectronic devices have become an essential feature of just about all aspects of modern society. Yet, due in part to the growing use of the internet, they're bumping up against their limits in terms of processing speed and miniaturization. What's more, they consume vast amounts of energy in transporting and storing information, losing some of that energy as they go. Engineers\u2014including those at EPFL\u2014have been working for years to overcome these obstacles, such as by studying excitons and their behavior in 2D materials.\nExcitons are made up of an electron (which has a negative charge) and a hole (which has a positive charge). They hold the key to the next generation of electronic devices\u2014ones that are smaller and faster and result in much less power loss. With excitons, which can either replace or work with electrons, it's light rather than electricity that carries data and runs calculations.\n\"Light is already used in fiber optics,\" says Fedele Tagarelli, a Ph.D. student at EPFL's Laboratory of Nanoscale Electronics and Structures (LANES), headed by Prof. Andras Kis. \"Although light is widely used to transport information, light-based computing systems have been hindered by materials limitations and scalability issues.\"\nEdoardo Lopriore, another Ph.D. student at LANES, explains, \"Excitons, unlike electrons, could cause much less heating when moving through a material and work very well with light. But to leverage their full potential, we need to be able to understand and control how they're generated and interact with each other, along with their speed and life span. All this is still in the research stage.\" Under ideal conditions, excitons can reach a superfluid state, meaning they can travel without energy or resistance\u2014and therefore without any power loss.\nRepulsive force\nEngineers at LANES, together with colleagues at the University of Marburg in Germany and the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan, have looked specifically at one key property of excitons: the repulsive force between them. They developed a testing system comprised of several layers of different materials. The top and bottom layers are made of metal, while the middle section consists of an insulating material and layers of a semiconducting 2D material\u2014in this case, tungsten diselenide (WSe2)\u2014stacked on top of each other and bound together by van der Waals forces. 2D materials have the unique feature of being extremely thin\u2014just a single layer of atoms. \"They have completely different properties from 3D materials and let us explore new physics phenomena,\" says Tagarelli.\nThe engineers applied an electric field to their device and found they could control the excitons' repulsive interactions. \"As far as we know, this is the first time such control has been demonstrated, or at least in such a simple way,\" says Tagarelli. \"We've discovered a new method for controlling interactions between hybrid excitons, which can provide a unique opportunity for studies in condensed matter physics.\" In a previous study, LANES engineers succeeded in controlling the life span and movements of excitons.\nFor the engineers' method to work, the excitons shouldn't be directly subjected to an electric current but rather be able to \"sense\" an electric field\u2014hence the outer metal layers and inner insulating layer to protect the semiconducting 2D material. The engineers' experiments were run at the extremely low temperature of 4 Kelvin.\n\"This discovery further expands our toolkit for controlling excitons so that they can one day be used to process data in a more environmentally responsible way,\" says Kis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFedele Tagarelli et al, Electrical control of hybrid exciton transport in a van der Waals heterostructure, Nature Photonics (2023).

   "text": "It is often desirable to restrict flows\u2014whether of sound, electricity, or heat\u2014to one direction, but naturally occurring systems almost never allow this. However, unidirectional flow can indeed be engineered under certain conditions, and the resulting systems are said to exhibit chiral behavior.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of chirality is traditionally limited to single direction flows in one dimension. In 2021, however, researchers working with Taylor Hughes, a professor of physics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, introduced a theoretical extension that can account for more intricate chiral flows in two dimensions.\nNow, a team led by Hughes and Gaurav Bahl, a UIUC professor of mechanical science & engineering, has experimentally realized this extension. As the researchers reported in Nature Communications, they constructed a topological circuit network, a system of electronics that simulates the microscopic behavior of quantum materials, to explore the entirely new behaviors predicted by this extended, or higher-rank chirality.\n\"In effect, we have generalized the idea of a one-way street into two dimensions,\" Hughes said. \"In two dimensions there is no absolute sense of something going one way or the other, but if you carry around a fixed arrow with you, then you can still describe chiral motion relative to that arrow.\"\nIndeed, higher-rank chirality manifests as locking between a particle's flow direction and the direction of an arrow, or vector quantity, that it carries along with it. For this study, the team focused on rank-2 chirality where the flow is locked to be transverse to the momentum vector carried by the particles.\nPenghao Zhu, the study's lead author and a UIUC physics graduate student, explained, \"In standard chirality, flows can only go one way\u2014to the right, let's say. However, a rank-2 system is designed so that if a particle's momentum is up, then it flows to the right, and if the momentum points down, then it flows to the left.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                Credit: The Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign\n             \n\n\nIn the 2021 study, Hughes' group proposed a quantum material system for rank-2 chirality, but their interdisciplinary team realized they could explore the behaviors of this system with a topological circuit network instead. On this platform, chirality is a consequence of microscopic dissipation or friction, called non-Hermiticity, that has been engineered to only impact flows in particular directions such that unwanted flows die off quickly, leaving only flow in the desired direction.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nZhu and postdoctoral fellow Xiao-Qi Sun designed a circuit network that exhibits the needed non-Hermiticity, and they collaborated with Bahl to construct this \"meta\" material and perform experimental measurements. According to Zhu, the material displayed an important signature of chiral systems: the non-Hermitian skin effect, where the imposed unidirectionality makes the flow accumulate on the system's boundary.\n\"Moreover, our experiment displays new phenomena that have not been previously explored, like corner localization, where the flows accumulate at the material corners,\" he said. \"This is something very special to rank-2 chirality and cannot be seen in any skin effect that has been previously demonstrated.\"\nThe generalizations offered by higher-rank chirality suggest a new class of devices that could be used to filter flows and engineer optical beams. Sun imagines a device that separates photons, or particles of light, based on the direction they travel: if only the photons traveling to the right are desired, then a rank-2 chiral material could remove the leftward propagating photons by forcing them into a different direction to be discarded.\n\"Another useful mapping of this idea could be made to semiconductor electronic devices, where new and unique filtering operations may be accomplished with electrons,\" Bahl said. \"Pretty much every electronic computation and communication device that we use today relies on controlling the flow of electrons. If we are able to replicate this higher-rank chiral behavior in microelectronics, a behavior that we've never had access to before, it could lead to some transformative new applications.\"\nSun added that the true reward of studying higher-rank systems is a deeper understanding of what is possible.\n\"By designing and constructing systems that extend our understanding, we are taking the first step towards a much more generalized universe,\" he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPenghao Zhu et al, Higher rank chirality and non-Hermitian skin effect in a topolectrical circuit, Nature Communications (2023).

   "text": "An optical spectrometer is an instrument used to measure properties of light over a specific portion of the light spectrum. These devices have found a wide range of practical applications. Dispersive optical elements (e.g., a diffraction grating or a prism) are the key components of the conventional spectrometer used to achieve the desired dispersion.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDispersion originates from the variation of the material's refractive index with the wavelength of the incident light beam. The combination of such free-space optical elements along with the free-space propagation volume result in bulky spectrometers, which are incompatible with on-chip integration technology. To meet the requirement of system integration, there is a pressing need for a compact, simple, and efficient approach to realize a high-resolution spectrometer.\nIn a paper published in Light: Science & Applications, a team of researchers, led by Prof. Xianzhong Chen from Institute of Photonics and Quantum Sciences, School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, UK, have proposed a new method for dispersion control.\nThey have developed an ultra-thin spectrometer with a nanometer resolution by controlling the dispersion using a single metasurface device, which was designed based on a novel lens model. The uniqueness of this technique lies in the novel lens design that can simultaneously realize wavelength splitting and light focusing.\nThe compactness and ultrathin nature of the spectrometer render this technology very attractive for potential applications in on-chip integrated photonics where spectral analysis and information processing can be performed in a compact platform.\nThe wavelengths of the incident light beam are accurately mapped to different positions on the focal plane using the proposed device. The device consists of gold nanorods with spatially variant orientations sitting on a glass substrate. Upon the illumination of left circularly polarized light, the right circularly polarized light (converted part) is converged at the desired positions, i.e., a predesigned ring. The ring is designed to incorporate multiple focal points, and each focal point corresponds to a different incident wavelength.\nThe design process of the proposed metasurface spectrometer includes a unique design technique of multi-foci metalens with wavelength information. The researchers explained:\n\"We initially consider the phase profile of a metalens that can generate a single focal point at the desired position governed by Fermat's principle. Individual phase profiles of different metalenses with a single focal point can be integrated into one combined phase profile. Then, the wavelength of each focal point is considered a design variable and added to the phase profile of multi-foci metalens. A single-layer metasurface consisting of gold nanorods with spatially variant orientations is employed to realize the desired functionality.\"\n\"The larger samples of metasurface will enable accurate linewidth detection and continuous spectrum recognition. The increase in the sample size will increase the number of wavelength dependent focal points, which will help boost the resolution and working bandwidth of the metasurface spectrometer,\" they added.\n\"The proposed approach is very flexible and robust, providing a new scheme for controlling the desired dispersion under the illumination of both mono and polychromatic incident light beams. The design flexibility and ultrathin nature render the ultra-compact spectrometer very attractive for monolithic on-chip integration with sensor technology. This technology can be effectively utilized for many exciting applications in the areas of spectral analysis, information security, and information processing,\" the scientists say.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRuoxing Wang et al, Compact multi-foci metalens spectrometer, Light: Science & Applications (2023).

New, energy-efficient hardware designs could help meet this demand while reducing computing's energy use, supporting faster processing, and allowing AI training to take place within the device itself.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In my opinion, we have already transitioned from the internet era to the AI era,\" says Shan Wang, the Leland T. Edwards Professor in the School of Engineering at Stanford University. \"We want to enable AI on edge\u2014training locally on your home computer, phone, or smartwatch\u2014for things like heart attack detection or speech recognition. To do that, you need a very fast, non-volatile memory.\"\nWang and his colleagues recently found a material that could bring a new type of memory closer to commercialization. In a new paper published in Nature Materials, the researchers demonstrated that a thin layer of a metallic compound called manganese palladium three had the necessary properties to facilitate a form of working memory that stores data in electron spin directions.\nThis method of memory storage, known as spin orbit torque magnetoresistive random access memory or SOT-MRAM, has the potential to store data more quickly and efficiently than current methods, which store data using electric charge and require a continuous power input to maintain that data.\n\"We've provided a basic building block for future energy-efficient storage elements,\" Wang says. \"It's very foundational, but it's a breakthrough.\"\nHarnessing electron spin\nSOT-MRAM relies on an intrinsic property of electrons called spin. To understand spin, picture an electron as a rotating basketball balanced on the end of a professional athlete's finger. Because electrons are charged particles, the rotation turns the electron into a tiny magnet, polarized along its axis (in this case, a line that extends from the finger balancing the ball). If the electron switches spin directions, the north-south poles of the magnet switch. Researchers can use the up or down direction of that magnetism\u2014known as the magnetic dipole moment\u2014to represent the ones and zeroes that make up bits and bytes of computer data.\nIn SOT-MRAM, a current flowing through one material (the SOT layer) generates specific spin directions. The movement of those electrons, coupled with their spin directions, creates a torque that can switch the spin directions and associated magnetic dipole moments of electrons in an adjacent magnetic material. With the right materials, storing magnetic data is as simple as switching the direction of an electrical current in the SOT layer.\nBut finding the right SOT materials isn't easy. Because of the way the hardware is designed, data can be stored more densely when electron spin directions are oriented up or down in the z-direction. (If you imagine a sandwich on a plate, the x- and y-directions follow the edges of the bread and the z-direction is the toothpick shoved through the middle.) Unfortunately, most materials polarize electron spins in the y-direction if the current flows in the x-direction.\n\"Conventional materials only generate spin in the y-direction\u2014that means we would need an external magnetic field to make switching happen in the z-direction, which takes more energy and space,\" says Fen Xue, a postdoctoral researcher in Wang's lab. \"For the purpose of lowering the energy and having a higher density of memory, we want to be able to realize this switching without an external magnetic field.\"\nThe researchers found that manganese palladium three has the properties they need. The material is able to generate spins in any orientation because its internal structure lacks the kind of crystal symmetry that would force all of the electrons into a particular orientation. Using manganese palladium three, the researchers were able to demonstrate magnetization switching in both the y- and z-directions without needing an external magnetic field. Although not demonstrated in the manuscript, x-direction magnetization can also be switched in the absence of external magnetic field.\n\"We have the same input current as other conventional materials, but we have three different directions of spins now,\" says Mahendra DC, who conducted the work as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford and is first author on the paper. \"Depending on the application, we can control the magnetization in whatever direction we want.\"\nDC and Wang credit the multidisciplinary and multi-institutional collaboration that enabled these advances. \"Evgeny Tsymbal's lab at the University of Nebraska led the calculations to predict the unexpected spin directions and movement and Julie Borchers's lab at the National Institute of Standards and Technology led the measurements and modeling efforts to reveal the intricate microstructures within manganese palladium three,\" says Wang. \"It truly takes a village.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nManufacturing possibilities\nIn addition to its symmetry-breaking structure, manganese palladium three has several other properties that make it an excellent candidate for SOT-MRAM applications. It can, for example, survive and maintain its properties through the post-annealing process that electronics need to go through.\n\"Post-annealing requires electronics to be at 400 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes,\" DC says. \"That's one of the challenges for new materials in these devices, and manganese palladium three can handle that.\"\nAlso, the layer of manganese palladium three is created using a process called magnetron sputtering, which is a technique that is already used in other aspects of memory-storage hardware.\n\"There's no new tools or new techniques needed for this kind of material,\" Xue says. \"We don't need a textured substrate or special conditions to deposit it.\"\nThe result is a material that not only has novel properties that could help meet our growing computing requirements, but can fit smoothly into current manufacturing techniques. The researchers are already working on prototypes of SOT-MRAM using manganese palladium three that will integrate into real devices.\n\"We are hitting a wall with the current technology,\" DC says. \"So we have to figure out what other options we have.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMahendra DC et al, Observation of anti-damping spin\u2013orbit torques generated by in-plane and out-of-plane spin polarizations in MnPd3, Nature Materials (2023).

   "text": "In a study published in Nature Communications, Prof. Xiang Bin's group from University of Science and Technology of China of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in collaboration with Assoc. Prof. Wang Zhi from Sun Yat-sen University, discovered the long-range skin Josephson supercurrent across a van der Waals ferromagnet.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey bridged two spin-singlet superconductors NbSe2 (S) by constructing the van der Waals ferromagnet metal Fe3GeTe2 (F), and observed long-range supercurrent in the lateral Josephson junction (S/F/S) for the first time, which exhibits astonishing skin characteristics.\nFerromagnetism and superconductivity are two antagonistic macroscopic orderings. When the singlet supercurrent enters the ferromagnet, rapid decoherence of the Cooper pairs will be triggered.\nHowever, spin-triplet supercurrents induced in the vicinity of superconductor/ferromagnet interfaces enable transport without energy dissipation over long distances in ferromagnets, which has been proved theoretically and experimentally in recent years. This provides a more desirable method for constructing quantum devices without dissipation.\nEarlier research focused on the construction of superconducting Josephson junctions with coupled bulk ferromagnets to achieve the observation of spin-triplet currents and the control of spin and charge degrees of freedom. However, there are few reports on the observation of spin-triplet supercurrents and related studies of interfacial properties based on heterojunctions of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials.\nThe researchers constructed lateral vdW Josephson junctions of S/F/S by bridging two singlet vdW superconductors NbSe2 with vdW ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 (F). The electrical properties of the S/F/S with different junction channel lengths have been studied by low-temperature electrical tests. The results showed a zero-resistance state of the S/F/S and a long-range Josephson supercurrent (~ 300 nm).\nThe zero-temperature superconducting critical current tends to decay with increasing channel length and disappears completely when the channel length increases to 450 nm.\nMore interestingly, the response of the long-range superconducting critical current to an external magnetic field perpendicular to the supercurrent channel presented a periodic oscillation pattern, which is similar to double-slit interference, rather than the conventional Fraunhofer periodic oscillation stripe. This result confirmed the existence of a Josephson supercurrent with a long-range skin feature in S/F/S that is distinctive from the Josephson superconducting current of conventional bulk channels.\nAdditionally, the researchers proposed two possible mechanisms for the skin feature of the long-range supercurrent. First, the Rashba spin-orbit coupling induced by the mirror symmetry breaking on the Fe3GeTe2 surface, when interacting with ferromagnetism and the s-wave superconductivity of NbSe2, may lead to 2D topological superconductivity on the Fe3GeTe2 surface.\nSecond, the magnetic inhomogeneity caused by the non-coplanar structure of Fe atoms in Fe3GeTe2 promotes the transformation of spin-singlet Cooper pairs into spin-triplet pairs at the surface through spin-rotation and spin-mixing, and then forms a long-range Josephson supercurrent.\nThe S/F/S design of the noncoplanar structure provides a new perspective to explore the interaction between ferromagnetism and superconductivity. The novel physical properties presented by this noncoplanar structure provide a platform for potential applications of new quantum functional devices in 2D superconducting spintronics and the realization of topological superconductivity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGuojing Hu et al, Long-range skin Josephson supercurrent across a van der Waals ferromagnet, Nature Communications (2023).

   "text": "Surfactants play an important role in every day life, for instance as major components in soaps. Since they feature hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts in their structure, they accumulate at water interfaces with air and can there influence the rate of evaporation of the solution or the efficiency with which gas molecules are taken up by the solution, a process that is for instance important for the incorporation of carbon dioxide into the oceans.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow surfactants arrange themselves at the interface of water with air is an intriguing question that has fascinated scientist for centuries, going back to Benjamin Franklin who noted the calming effect of cooking oil on the surface of water, and Agnes Pockels who did some of the first systematic experiments on the subject in the late 19th century.\nThe question of the arrangement of surfactant molecules at the water-air interface is not easy to answer since a close look at the very skin of liquid water requires methods that hone in on the outer layers of water, where surfactant molecules are located in a layer with a thickness of only a few billionths of a meter.\nElastically scattered electrons offer the clue\nA collaborative investigation of scientists from the Departments of Inorganic Chemistry, Molecular Physics and Theory at the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin recently demonstrated a new method to address this problem, based on the elastic scattering of photoelectrons that are emitted upon irradiation of water\u2014surfactant\u2014vapor interface by X-rays.\nThe surfactant that they studied was perfluorinated pentanoic acid, in which four of the five carbon atoms can be distinguished from each other in the C 1s (inner shell) core level photoelectron spectrum, and in particular the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic ends of the molecule can be distinguished from each other in the experiment.\nPerfluorinated pentanoic acid also belongs to the class of so-called \"forever chemicals\" that have recently moved into focus as prime pollutants in natural waters; these molecules are hard to remove and cause harm to the environment. The measurements were performed at the synchrotron radiation light sources BESSY-II in Berlin and SOLEIL near Paris at X-ray beamlines that allow to change the direction of the linear polarization of the X-rays.\nThe angle between the direction of the polarization and the electron detector determines the intensity of the detected electron signal. The intensity distribution as a function of angle offers a clue on how many elastic \"collisions\" the electrons experienced on their way to the electron detector.\nSince water is a dense medium, electrons originating at those parts of the surfactant molecule that are immersed deeper into water will experience more elastic scattering than electrons that emerge from the parts of the molecule that stick out into air, which is much less dense than water. The experiments showed that the elastic scattering is sensitive enough to observe differences in the scattering from neighboring carbon atoms in the molecule, which are separated only by about one-ten billionth of a meter (0.1 nm).\nMolecular dynamics simulations provide the ruler\nWhile the experiments qualitatively showed the expected orientation of the molecule, with the hydrophobic end pointing towards air and the hydrophilic end towards water, the experiments alone cannot quantify the average position of the molecule with respect to the water-air interface. This was possible using molecular dynamics simulations, that follow the trajectories of water and surfactant molecules over time and deliver a molecular scale \"movie.\"\nThe average position of the surfactant relative to the sample surface can then be determined from many snapshots taken from that movie and compared to the elastic scattering data. It was found that there is an excellent agreement between the theoretical calculations and experimental data.\nThis is encouraging for future measurements which will focus on the interplay of surfactant molecules with dissolved ions in water, a phenomenon that is present at the water-air interfaces of all natural systems, including oceans, rivers, and aqueous aerosol droplets.\nThe findings are published in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tR.

   "text": "A time crystal, as originally proposed in 2012, is a new state of matter in which the particles are in continuous oscillatory motion. Time crystals break time-translation symmetry. Discrete time crystals do so by oscillating under the influence of a periodic external parametric force, and this type of time crystal has been demonstrated in trapped ions, atoms and spin systems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous time crystals are more interesting and arguably more important, as they exhibit continuous time-translation symmetry but can spontaneously enter a regime of periodic motion, induced by a vanishingly small perturbation. It is now understood that this state is only possible in an open system, and a continuous quantum-time-crystal state has recently been observed in a quantum system of ultracold atoms inside an optical cavity illuminated with light.\nIn a paper published in Nature Physics, researchers at University of Southampton in the U.K. showed that a classical metamaterial nanostructure can be driven to a state that exhibits the same key characteristics of a continuous time crystal.\n\"We have been studying light-matter interactions with nano-opto-mechanical metamaterials for several years,\" Nikolay I. Zheludev, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org. \"We recently realized that this was a perfect platform for demonstrating the time crystal state,\"\nAs part of their recent study, Zheludev and his colleagues set out to realize a continuous time crystal state using a photonic metamaterial. The system they used is a 2D array of plasmonic metamolecules (i.e., artificial structures that facilitate interaction with light at the nanoscale) supported by flexible nanowires.\nThe researchers demonstrated that continuously and coherently illuminating this photonic metamaterial with a light that resonates with the plasmonic mode of the metamolecules contained within it caused a spontaneous phase transition to a state that possesses the key properties of a continuous time crystal. This state is characterized by continuous oscillations resulting from many-body interactions between the metamolecules.\n\"We found that a photonic metamaterial, an array of nanowires decorated with plasmonic nanoparticles, can be driven to the state of coherent oscillations of the nanowires by light-induced interaction between the particles,\" Zheludev explained. \"These oscillations emerge spontaneously upon reaching a threshold of light illumination. Such behavior constitutes a continuous time crystal, a new state of matter.\"\nThe recent study by this team of researchers could open new avenues for research into time crystals and dynamic classical many-body states in the strongly correlated regime. In the future, the unique system realized by Zheludev and his colleagues could also pave the way toward the development of new optical and photonic devices.\n\"We demonstrated a continuous time crystal, a new state of matter on a simple classical platform, which is a substantial step towards applications of the continuous time crustal state in photonics devices,\" Zheludev added. \"The reported observation is only the beginning, and we will continue exploring fundamental properties of the nano-opto-mechanical metamaterial continuous time crystals and their applications.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTongjun Liu et al, Photonic metamaterial analogue of a continuous time crystal, Nature Physics (2023).

The results were published in Nature.\nThe development of robust semiconductor spin qubits could help the realization of large-scale quantum computers in the future. However, current quantum dot based qubit systems are still in their infancy. In 2022, researchers at QuTech in the Netherlands were able to create 6 silicon-based spin qubits for the first time. With graphene, there is still a long way to go. The material, which was first isolated in 2004, is highly attractive to many scientists. But the realization of the first quantum bit has yet to come.\n\"Bilayer graphene is a unique semiconductor,\" explains Prof. Christoph Stampfer of Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich and RWTH Aachen University. \"It shares several properties with single-layer graphene and also has some other special features. This makes it very interesting for quantum technologies.\"\nOne of these features is that it has a bandgap that can be tuned by an external electric field from zero to about 120 milli-electronvolt. The band gap can be used to confine charge carriers in individual areas, so-called quantum dots. Depending on the applied voltage, these can trap a single electron or its counterpart, a hole\u2014basically a missing electron in the solid-state structure. The possibility of using the same gate structure to trap both electrons and holes is a feature that has no counter part in conventional semiconductors.\n\"Bilayer graphene is still a fairly new material. So far, mainly experiments that have already been realized with other semiconductors have been carried out with it. Our current experiment now goes really beyond this for the first time,\" Christoph Stampfer says. He and his colleagues have created a so-called double quantum dot: two opposing quantum dots, each housing an electron and a hole whose spin properties mirror each other almost perfectly.\n\n\n\n\n\n                The double quantum dots were produced at the Helmholtz Nano Facility, the central technology platform for the production of nanostructures and circuits in the Helmholtz Association.

This mechanism can be used to couple qubits to other qubits over a longer distance. And what's more, \"the symmetry results in a very robust blockade mechanism which could be used to read out the spin state of the dot with high fidelity.\"\n\"This goes beyond what can be done in conventional semiconductors or any other two-dimensional electron systems,\" says Prof. Fabian Hassler of the JARA Institute for Quantum Information at Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich and RWTH Aachen University, co-author of the study.\n\"The near-perfect symmetry and strong selection rules are very attractive not only for operating qubits, but also for realizing single-particle terahertz detectors. In addition, it lends itself to coupling quantum dots of bilayer graphene with superconductors, two systems in which electron-hole symmetry plays an important role. These hybrid systems could be used to create efficient sources of entangled particle pairs or artificial topological systems, bringing us one step closer to realizing topological quantum computers.\"\nThe research results were published in the journal Nature.

   "text": "The motion of an electron in a strong infrared laser field is tracked in real time by means of a novel method developed by MPIK physicists and applied to confirm quantum-dynamics theory by cooperating researchers at MPI-PKS. The experimental approach links the absorption spectrum of the ionizing extreme ultraviolet pulse to the free-electron motion driven by the subsequent near-infrared pulse. Their paper is published in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this experimental scheme, the classical description of the electron motion is justified even though it is a quantum object. In the future, the new method demonstrated here for helium can be applied to more complex systems such as larger atoms or molecules for a broad range of intensities.\nHigh-harmonic generation, namely the conversion of optical or near-infrared (NIR) light into the extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) regime, is fundamental to strong-field physics, since it is an extremely nonlinear process. In the famous three-step model the driving light field (1) ionizes the electron by tunnel ionization, (2) accelerates it away and back to the ionic core, where the electron (3) re-collides and emits XUV light if it recombines.\nIn a new experimental approach at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics (MPIK) in Heidelberg, physicists from the division of Thomas Pfeifer replaced the first step with an XUV single photon ionization, which has a twofold advantage. First, one can choose the time of the ionization relative to the NIR phase. Tunnel ionization would only happen in the field maximum. The extremely short XUV pulse is only hundreds of attoseconds long providing a controllable and well-defined start of the clock. Second, the NIR laser can be tuned to low intensities where tunnel ionization is practically not possible any more. This allows the study of strong-field-driven electron re-collision in a low-intensity limiting case.\nThe technique used here is attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 1) together with the reconstruction of the time-dependent dipole moment, which was developed before in the group around Christian Ott for bound electrons. Here, this technique is extended to free electrons, and it connects the time-dependent dipole moment with the classical motion (trajectories) of the ionized electrons.\n\"Our new method, applied to helium as a model system, links the absorption spectrum of the ionizing light to the electron trajectories,\" explains Ph.D. student Tobias Heldt. \"This allows us to study ultrafast dynamics with a single spectroscopic measurement without the need of scanning a time delay to compose the dynamics frame by frame.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                Fig. 2: Illustration of the classical trajectory (green) with multiple recollisions and changes of the quantum wave packets (red/blue background) for a NIR (red) laser-driven electron emerging from XUV (violet) ionization of helium. Credit: MPI f\u00fcr Kernphysik\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe measurements show that for some experimental parameters the probability of driving the electron back to the ion can be higher if the light wave is not linearly but circularly polarized. This is a counterintuitive finding that has however been predicted by theorists. Classical simulations performed by Jonathan Dubois and Gabriel M. Lando at the MPI-PKS in Dresden justify this interpretation, i.e. re-colliding periodic orbits. Fig. 2 illustrates a classical trajectory (green) versus the changes in the quantum probability distribution of the electron wave packets (background) emerging from the atom after ionization by the XUV pulse (violet) and driven by the NIR field (red).\nEvery time the electron (re-)collides with the helium atom (green line intersects the white center line) it leads to a characteristic modification and increase of the time-dependent atomic dipole (result of the quick red-blue oscillation near the center line), which can be picked up by an attosecond absorption-spectroscopy experiment.\nGroup leader Christian Ott is optimistic about the future potential of this new approach. \"In general, our technique allows to explore laser-driven electron motion in a new lower-intensity regime and it could further be applied on various systems, e.g., for studying the laser-driven electron dynamics within larger atoms or molecules.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTobias Heldt et al, Attosecond Real-Time Observation of Recolliding Electron Trajectories in Helium at Low Laser Intensities, Physical Review Letters (2023).

   "text": "The start of this year's physics run at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) also marks the start of a new era. For the first time since RHIC began operating at the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory in 2000, a brand new detector will track what happens when the nuclei of gold atoms smash into one another at nearly the speed of light. That new detector, sPHENIX, has been a decade in the making. It has a host of components for making precision measurements never possible before at RHIC.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRHIC's STAR detector, which has been running and evolving since 2000, will also see some firsts in Run 23. Its most recently upgraded components allow the detector to \"see\" more particles streaming out of collisions closer to the collision point and at wider angles than ever before. This suite of components, which operated successfully in lower-energy collisions, will now collect data from full-energy collisions for the first time. In addition, STAR physicists look forward to flexing the detector's capacity for capturing up to 5,000 collision events per second, more than double its rate in any previous year.\n\"There's a very rich physics program to be run and great interest worldwide\u2014and in the media\u2014in this physics program,\" said Jamie Dunlop, Brookhaven Lab Physics Department Associate Chair for Nuclear Physics.\nOne reason for that interest? RHIC's research delves into the matter that makes up everything visible in the universe today\u2014stars, planets, and even you and me. RHIC scientists use particle collisions to study that matter by effectively turning back the hands of time.\nColliding atomic nuclei at very high energies melts the boundaries of individual protons and neutrons, setting free those particles' innermost building blocks: quarks and gluons. Such a system of \"free\" quarks and gluons\u2014known as a quark-gluon plasma (QGP)\u2014existed in nature some 14 billion years ago, a millionth of a second after the birth of the universe, before protons and neutrons formed. Studying this substance using detectors like STAR and sPHENIX offers clues to why matter behaves the way it does.\nWhy a new detector?\n\"The initial thought behind RHIC was does the QGP exist?\" said Brookhaven Lab physicist and sPHENIX co-spokesperson Dave Morrison. \"Then a big part of what RHIC and the heavy-ion program at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have done has been exploring how the QGP behaves, what are its properties?\"\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) physicist Gunther Roland, the other sPHENIX co-spokesperson, noted, \"We have answers to those questions over the last 15 years or so. Now we want to move to a new set of questions\u2014to understand how these properties arise from the underlying interactions of quarks and gluons. Nobody knows the answer to that. We realized we needed a new experiment to provide those answers.\"\nThe science goals of the sPHENIX detector were highlighted in the 2015 Long Range Plan for Nuclear Science, a roadmap that guides U.S. research in the field. The detector has precision components to collect the data needed to answer very specific questions about jets (collimated collections of particles produced in collisions) and a family of quark-antiquark particles known as upsilons.\nStudying the way different upsilons interact with the matter created in RHIC collisions, Morrison said, \"is like putting a tape measure inside the QGP and measuring something about the distance over which the forces that are affecting quarks and gluons operate.\" And tracking the angles at which the particles that make up jets traverse the plasma, and the energy or momentum they have, \"gives us different handles on the ways QGP affects how quarks and gluons interact.\"\nBut before the scientists can make those precision measurements, they will ensure the detector they've built over the past seven and a half years operates correctly.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nCommissioning sPHENIX\n\"sPHENIX is a very complex detector with many distinct systems, and the extensive process of commissioning everything will be the top priority of the 2023 run,\" Morrison said.\n\"Many hundreds of people have been working on sPHENIX for many years and there's a lot of excitement,\" Roland added. \"But one needs to proceed with great care and in a very systematic fashion.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                An end-view of the Time Project Chamber of the sPHENIX detector, which will be seeing its first collisions during Run 23 at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The top priority of the run will be commissioning all the complex components of sPHENIX. Credit: Brookhaven National Laboratory\n             \n\n\nFor one thing, while RHIC will operate at its highest energy for heavy ion collisions (200 billion electron volts, or GeV, per colliding pair of nuclei), its luminosity\u2014the rate of collisions\u2014will be kept deliberately low for at least the first several weeks of the run.\n\"We will systematically verify the operation of each of the detector systems\u2014starting with the simplest ones that provide the trigger (telling us if there is a collision or not) to some of the most complex detectors that have ever been employed in high energy nuclear physics,\" Roland said.\nThe sPHENIX crew is planning a period of systematic troubleshooting.\n\"There are always little mysteries that pop up and then need to be solved as you commission this sort of one-of-a-kind detector\u2014or collection of one-of-a-kind devices\u2014for the first time,\" Roland noted.\nThey'll do some measurements for which they already know the answer and make whatever adjustments are needed to be sure all the detector components are working together to capture details of each collision. Thinking about what happens at full luminosity makes it clear why this process is much easier with fewer collisions happening.\n\"At full luminosity you can have a collision every 100 nanoseconds. So quite a few collisions can happen, each of them putting tracks into the 'time projection chamber' (TPC) of the detector,\" Morrison said. All the electrons that make up those tracks drift along, potentially overlapping and interfering with one another.\nThere's also a complex system of lasers inside the TPC, which will produce known electron tracks scientists use to compare with those generated by particles emitted from collisions.\n\"It's going to be like a discoth\u00e8que inside with lasers going every which way,\" Morrison said. \"We need to make sure we understand how the lasers work, how the TPC works, and all the other components when there aren't very many collisions per second before we ramp up to full luminosity.\"\n\"Soft\" explorations at STAR\nMeanwhile, even with low collision rates at the beginning of the run, STAR will be making use of the high collision energy.\n\"The last 200 GeV gold-gold run at RHIC was in 2016,\" said STAR co-spokesperson Lijuan Ruan, a physicist at Brookhaven. Since then, she explained, one detector component that was great for measurements needed at the time but that reduced the resolution of other measurements has been removed\u2014thus promising increased resolution for this run. In addition, a slew of STAR component upgrades has increased the detector's ability to track particles closest to the collision point and also at the widest angles ever in the \"forward\" direction at one end of the detector.\n\"Run 23 is the first time all those detector upgrades will see particles emerging from interactions at RHIC's top collision energy,\" Ruan said.\nDuring this run and the planned run for 2025, which will also collide gold ions at 200 GeV, the STAR team will use those components and the rest of STAR's capabilities to collect high-statistics data on particles with very low energy or transverse momentum. Extending measurements of these so-called \"soft observables\" into the forward region, for example, can help reveal global properties of the QGP. Examples include how particles flow collectively through the plasma, the temperature dependence of variables such as viscosity, and the degree to which variations in the interactions among quarks and gluons influence the spin alignment of particles streaming out.\n\"Previously, we were looking at one observable or another at a time and comparing those measurements with predictions from models to get conclusions,\" Ruan said. \"But now, with the new detector capabilities and high statistics, we are entering a precision era using multiple observables\u2014a multi-messenger approach\u2014to look at them globally. That will inform our understanding of the evolution of heavy ion collisions and the properties of the QGP.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                The silicon tracker detector modules installed around the beampipe at one end of the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) are just one of the recently upgraded STAR components that will see full-energy gold-gold collisions for the first time during Run 23. Credit: Brookhaven National Laboratory\n             \n\n\nTo get those high statistics, STAR will also make use of a recent upgrade that more than doubles the readout speed of its TPC. Previously able to record a maximum of 2000 events per second, the STAR TPC can now capture up to 5000 collisions in less than the blink of an eye.\nWith the run starting at relatively low luminosity, STAR physicists may not be able to push their detector to that max level until later this summer. But they understand the need to provide sPHENIX with the conditions needed to come up to speed.\n\"Commissioning their detector is the most important thing for this run. We will collect data, but sPHENIX is going to be driving the run,\" said Yale University physicist Helen Caines, who recently concluded her six-year term as a STAR co-spokesperson.\nWhen the collision rates ramp up, STAR will be ready.\n\"We have the best particle acceptance, highest-rate detector that we've had at STAR at this point, so we're going to collect data with the best and most comprehensive suite of detectors we've had to date,\" Caines said. \"This will be a data set that we can analyze for a long time into the future.\"\nBring on the luminosity\nThe sPHENIX collaboration is also eager to get to full luminosity to begin addressing the physics questions it was designed to answer.\n\"Our plan is for several weeks of data taking for physics, which would happen after commissioning the detector,\" sPHENIX collaboration co-spokesperson Morrison said. \"There's a ton of physics that sPHENIX can do with that data.\"\nThe new detector's mission will focus on hard probes\u2014energetic particle jets and particles made from heavy quarks, which require a lot of energy to generate.\n\"We'll get RHIC's first look at jets that come from the fragmentation of the very heavy bottom quark with fantastic statistical precision. These measurements can explore what happens to pairs of jets in a collision, for example those produced at different orientations relative to the rest of the particles coming out,\" Morrison said. \"That can help tell us how the truly microscopic interactions of quarks and gluons produce QGP properties like its perfect fluidity.\"\n\"We'll start seeing what happens to the three different members of the upsilon family of mesons,\" each made of a bottom quark bound to an antibottom quark but with different binding energies, he noted. Those measurements will give the scientists information about the length scale of the strong-force interactions among quarks and gluons, and potentially the temperature of the QGP.\nThe point of sPHENIX, MIT's Roland said, \"is to get a complete picture of the collisions in terms of these hard probes and in terms of their correlations with the soft particles that represent the bulk of the QGP once it turns back into hadrons [composite particles made of quarks and/or antiquarks].\"\nSome of those measurements will rely on additional gold-gold collision data collected in the 2025 run, and proton-proton collisions in 2024, which will provide essential comparison data.\n\"The full physics program requires as much data as can possibly be collected in RHIC's remaining runs to give us the statistical reach to complete the sPHENIX program,\" Roland said.\n\n\n\n\n\n                The new Extended Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) will have more intensity than its predecessor, delivering up to 40 percent more gold beam into the collider than in any previous run. Credit: Brookhaven National Laboratory\n             \n\n\nGenerating the collisions\nRHIC's experiments rely on accelerator physicists' ability to deliver particle beams at specified energies and rates within each detector. Under the guidance of Run 23 Coordinator Travis Shrey, the Collider-Accelerator Department (C-AD) staff at this DOE Office of Science user facility will demonstrate their strengths and the machine's versatility.\nAs noted, the run will start with beams of gold ions (the nuclei of gold atoms stripped of their electrons) entering RHIC's two counter-circulating rings at low intensity\u2014meaning fewer bunches of particles and fewer particles per bunch\u2014to keep the number of collisions low. But each beam will be accelerated to collide at full energy inside the sPHENIX and STAR detectors located at interaction regions where the two rings cross.\nRHIC has traditionally operated with the two beams traveling in opposite directions passing straight through one another inside the detectors. This allows collisions to occur between particles in the opposing beams across the entire length of each pair of colliding bunches. But for this run, the particles will travel a different path to cross one another at an angle.\n\"This crossing angle creates a narrower collision zone, which will improve the performance particularly of the sPHENIX detector,\" said Wolfram Fischer, chair of C-AD.\nDuring sPHENIX commissioning, accelerator physicists will use a range of tools to monitor the size and positions of the beams\u2014and techniques to control those beam properties\u2014to maintain a slow but constant collision rate at STAR.\nMonitoring and optimizing beams will continue as the collision rate ramps up, taking advantage of a newly recommissioned \"stochastic cooling\" system and a refurbished superconducting radiofrequency (RF) cavity.\n\"Sensors in the stochastic cooling system measure small random fluctuations in the positions of the particles within each bunch of particles and send signals to 'kicker' cavities that nudge the particles back together. These nudges result in more dense bunches,\" explained Michiko Minty, head of the Accelerator Division of C-AD. \"Similarly, the 56-megahertz RF cavity, together with the other RF cavities, will prevent bunches from lengthening due to intrabeam scattering.\"\nAll this squeezing and shortening of ion bunches increases the chance that the ions will collide. It also helps maintain the shorter beam-crossover region inside the sPHENIX detector.\n\"Higher beam intensities will also be available thanks to a recent upgrade in the Electron-Beam Ion Source (EBIS),\" Minty said. EBIS is the machine that generates RHIC's heavy ion beams and injects them into the accelerator chain that feeds the beams into the collider. \"This year we'll be operating with up to 40 percent more gold beam than in any previous run,\" she said.\nIn addition to delivering gold to the experiments, the C-AD staff will be implementing new systems for protecting the detectors when RHIC's beams are dumped periodically. They'll also be conducting tests of additional beam-cooling systems and acceleration schemes that will play a role in post-RHIC C-AD operations at Brookhaven, when many of RHIC's accelerator components are transformed into an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).\n\"We plan to make use of every second of this run to help sPHENIX and STAR accomplish their goals and to explore all the ways we can get the most out of the world's most versatile particle accelerator and collider complex\u2014both now and in the future,\" Fischer said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrookhaven National Laboratory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRHIC gets ready to smash gold ions for Run 23 (2023, May 8)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tretrieved 15 June 2023\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom https://phys.org/news/2023-05-rhic-ready-gold-ions.html\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This document is subject to copyright.

   "text": "When light strongly interacts with matter, it can produce unique quasi-particles called polaritons, which are half light and half matter. In recent decades, physicists explored the realization of polaritons in optical cavities and their value for the development of highly performing lasers or other technologies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers at University of Manitoba recently developed a highly performing device based on cavity magnon polaritons that can emit and amplify microwaves. This device, introduced in Physical Review Letters, was found to significantly outperform previously proposed solid-state devices for coherent microwave emission and amplification at room temperature.\n\"In 1992, Claude Weisbush, a French semiconductor physicist working in Japan, discovered cavity exciton polariton by confining light in a quantum microcavity to interact with semiconductors,\" Can-Ming Hu, the researcher who directed the study, told Phys.org.\n\"This led to the invention of polariton lasers with superior performance that have transformed solid-state laser technology. Two decades later, the magnetism community re-discovered cavity magnon polariton by confining microwaves in a cavity to interact with magnetic materials, such a half photon and half magnon quasi-particle was first discovered by Joe Artman and Peter Tannenwald in 1955 at MIT, which went largely unnoticed until recently.\"\nWireless communication and quantum information technologies require coherent on-chip microwave sources. Motivated by this need, Hu and his colleagues set out to explore the potential use of cavity magnon polaritons to achieve high-quality microwave emission and amplification.\n\"Intrigued by the resemblance between cavity magnon polariton and cavity exciton polariton, I became curious whether the cavity magnon polariton might help us to make better solid-state microwave sources,\" Hu said. \"So, in 2015, my group launched a study to explore microwave emission of cavity magnon polaritons.\"\nThe researchers initially set out to create a light\u2013matter coupled system based on cavity magnon polaritons for coherent microwave emission. They ultimately hoped to achieve a higher performance than those reported in previous works, while retaining their device's stability and controllability as a hybrid light\u2013matter coupled system.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"First, we follow the principle proposed in 1920 by Dutch physicist van der Pol: using nonlinear damping to balance gain in an amplified oscillatory system, one can design and optimize a stable gain-driven cavity,\" Bimu Yao, an associate professor from the Chinese Academy of Sciences who carried out this study at the University of Manitoba, told Phys.org. \"Then, we set a magnetic material into such a gain-driven microwave cavity, letting the amplified microwaves to strongly interact with magnons.\"\nThe strong interaction between amplified microwaves and magnons in the researchers' system produces a new type of polariton, which they dubbed a \"gain-driven\" polariton. Compared to conventional polaritons realized in previous studies, this gain-driven polariton has a stable phase, which in turn enables the coherent emission of microwave photons.\n\"For decades, the magnetism community has been working on spin-toque oscillator (STO), which is a solid-state device that utilizes magnons to produce coherent microwaves,\" Yongsheng Gui, a research associate at the University of Manitoba who carried out the study, told Phys.org. \"The major hurdle is that the emission power of the STO is typically limited to less than 1 nW. Our device's output is a million times more powerful, and the emission quality factor is a thousand times better.\"\nIn initial evaluations, a proof-of-principle device created by this team of researchers achieved remarkable results, outperforming both STOs and solid-state masers developed in the past. Masers are devices that use the stimulated emission of radiation by atoms to amplify or generate microwave radiation.\n\"Outside of the magnetism community, there have been divers efforts for developing masers,\" Gui said. \"Compared with the best solid-state maser, our device's output is a billion times more powerful, with a comparable emission quality factor.\"\nThe new gain-driven polariton realized by Hu and his colleagues could open exciting new possibilities for the development of highly performing solid-state microwave sources that can be integrated on-chip. In addition to their compact sizes, these polariton microwave sources are frequency tunable due to the fabulous controllability of light-matter interaction. They could ultimately be integrated in a broad range of technologies and devices, including wireless communication systems and quantum computers.\n\"As the physics of gain-driven light-matter interaction is new, our study may also lead to new discoveries beyond microwave applications,\" Hu added. \"We have now submitted a patent application, and my students are working on developing prototype devices together with industry partners.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBimu Yao et al, Coherent Microwave Emission of Gain-Driven Polaritons, Physical Review Letters (2023).

In the European Horizon 2020 project GALACTIC, the partners Laser Zentrum Hannover e.V. (LZH), Optomaterials S.r.l. (Italy) and Altechna (Lithuania) have now succeeded in establishing a solely European supply chain for alexandrite laser crystals, which can be used for space applications.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Italian partner Optomaterials produces competitive crystals, which the Lithuanian company Altechna provides with a special coating. To achieve the necessary properties for space-applications, Altechna has developed special coating designs and processes based on ion beam and magnetron sputtering processes.\nProven: Space suitability\nScientists at the LZH thoroughly tested the crystals in special laser systems. They have designed these systems with future applications in mind. The demonstrators could lay the foundation for new laser-based measuring instruments. The LZH's scientists exposed the Alexandrite crystals to proton and gamma radiation and ran them through several temperature cycles typical for space applications.\nBefore and after these environmental tests, they have characterized the crystals in terms of their transmission properties and laser performance, among other things. Since the environmental tests did not significantly change the measured parameters, the space suitability could be demonstrated. In addition, the researchers showed that the laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) of the crystals is equal to\u2014or even exceeds\u2014top products on the world market.\nThe GALACTIC team has thus successfully raised the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of space-qualified alexandrite crystals from Europe from 4 to 6 and have made the crystals ready for the market.\nSpecial properties for more precise data\nAlexandrite crystals have very good thermal conductivity and fracture strength. Therefore, they are suitable for use in high power laser systems and are robust enough to withstand the harsh conditions in space.\nSince the crystals can be used to tune the output wavelength of laser systems, they could form the basis of new types of laser-based measuring instruments for Earth observation satellites. Such instruments could be used to collect more precise climate-relevant data on the state of the atmosphere or vegetation.\nThe findings are published in the journal Optics Express.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tS.

   "text": "Transporting energy is costly. When a current runs through conductive materials, some of the energy is lost due to resistance as particles within the material interact\u2014just notice the warmth from your phone or laptop. This energy loss presents a hurdle to the advancement of many technologies and scientists are searching for ways to make superconductors that eliminate resistance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperconductors can also provide a platform for fault-tolerant quantum computing if endowed with topological properties. An example of the latter is the quantum Hall effect where the topology of electrons leads to universal, \"quantized,\" resistance with accuracy up to one part in a billion, which finds uses in meteorology. Unfortunately, the quantum Hall effect requires extremely strong magnetic fields, typically detrimental to superconductivity. This makes the search for topological superconductors a challenging task.\nIn two new papers in Physical Review Letters and Physical Review B UConn Physicist Pavel Volkov and his colleagues propose how to experimentally manipulate the quantum particles, called quasiparticles, in very thin layers of ordinary superconductors to create topological superconductors by slightly twisting the stacked layers.\nVolkov explains there is a lot of research being done on ways to engineer materials by stacking layers of two-dimensional materials together:\n\"Most famously, this has been done with graphene. Stacking two graphene layers in a particular way results in a lot of interesting new phenomena. Some parallel those in high-temperature superconductors, which was unexpected because, by itself, graphene is not superconducting.\"\nSuperconductivity happens when a material conducts current without any resistance or energy loss. Since resistance is a challenge for many technologies, superconducting materials have the potential to revolutionize how we do things, from energy transmission to quantum computing to more efficient MRI machines.\nHowever, endowing superconductors with topological properties is challenging, says Volkov, and as of now, there are no materials that can reliably perform as topological superconductors.\nThe researchers theorize that there is an intricate relation between what happens inside the twisted superconductor layers and a current applied between them. Volkov says the application of a current makes the quasiparticles in the superconductor behave as if they were in a topological superconductor.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"The twist is essentially determining the properties, and funnily enough, it gives you some very unexpected properties. We thought about applying twisting to materials that have a peculiar form of superconductivity called nodal superconductivity,\" says Volkov.\n\"Fortunately for us, such superconductors exist and, for example, the cuprate high-temperature superconductors are nodal superconductors. What we claim is that if you apply a current between two twisted layers of such superconductors, it becomes a topological superconductor.\"\nThe proposal for current-induced topological superconductivity is, in principle, applicable at any twist angle, Volkov explains, and there is a wide range of angles that optimize the characteristics, which is unlike other materials studied so far.\n\"This is important because, for example, in twisted bilayer graphene, observation of interesting new phenomena requires to align the two layers to 1.1 degrees and deviations by .1 degrees are strongly detrimental. That means that one is required to make a lot of samples before finding one that works. For our proposal this problem won't be as bad. If you miss the angle even by a degree, it's not going to destroy the effect we predict.\"\nVolkov expects that this topological superconductor has the potential to be better than anything else currently on the market. Though one caveat is they do not know exactly what the parameters of the resulting material will be, they have estimates that may be useful for proof of principle experiments.\nThe researchers also found unexpected behaviors for the special value of twist angle.\n\"We find a particular value of the angle, the so-called 'magic angle,' where a new state should appear\u2014a form of magnetism. Typically, magnetism and superconductivity are antagonistic phenomena but here, superconductivity begets magnetism, and this happens precisely because of the twisted structure of the layers.\" says Volkov.\nDemonstrating these predictions experimentally will bring more challenges to overcome, including making the atoms-thick layers better themselves and determining the difficult-to-measure parameters, but Volkov says there is a lot of motivation behind developing these highly complex materials.\n\"Basically, the main problem so far is that the candidate materials are tricky to work with. There are several groups around the world trying to do this. Monolayers of nodal superconductors, necessary for our proposal have been realized, and experiments on twisted flakes are ongoing. Yet, the twisted bilayer of these materials has not yet been demonstrated. That's work for the future.\"\nThese materials hold promise for improving materials we use in everyday life, says Volkov. Things already in use that take advantage of the topological states include devices used to set resistance standards with high accuracy. Topological superconductors are also potentially useful in quantum computing, as they serve as a necessary ingredient for proposals of fault-tolerant qubits, the units of information in quantum computing. Volkov also emphasizes the promise topological materials hold for precision physics,\n\"Topological states are useful because they allow us to do precision measurements with materials. A topological superconductor may allow us to perform such measurements with unprecedented precision for spin (magnetic moment of electron) or thermal properties.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPavel A.

These approximations often consist in being able to disregard certain size scales in certain cases. \"Sometimes you can find quite simple physical arguments for it,\" says Markus Wallerberger, one of the authors of the paper. \"A typical example of this are electrons and atomic nuclei in a crystal: the electrons are very light and move quickly. The atoms are much heavier, so on the time scale used to describe the motion of the electrons, the atoms can be considered rigid and immobile.\n\"In this case, we have split a complicated problem into two much simpler problems: we can now think about the fast movement of the electrons on the one hand and the much slower movement of the atoms on the other\u2014and think about how the two are related.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                (a) QTT representation in momentum space.

   "text": "Recently, the research group led by Prof. Liu Changsong from Institute of Solid State Physics (ISSP), Hefei Institutes of Physical Science (HFIPS) of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) developed a set of software for simulating the evolution of displacement damage in polycrystalline metals at across time and space scales, which was named object kinetic Monte Carlo-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo (OKMC-LKMC) hybridization simulation software.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing this software, research team explored the accumulation and evolution of vacancies at iron (Fe) grain boundaries (GBs).\nThe results were published in the Journal of Nuclear Materials.\nPolycrystalline/Nanocrystalline (PC/NC) Fe was found to exhibit improved radiation resistance. In previous multiscale simulations, GBs were often abstracted as two-dimensional planes without specific structures, and a series of energetic and kinetic parameters were used to characterize the structural characteristics of GBs.\nHowever, the diversity of GB character makes GBs exhibit distinct local structures and defect properties. If these properties are simply abstracted as a single interaction parameter, a lot of atomic information related to defects would be missed, thereby affecting the accurate prediction of defect evolution on a long time scale.\nThe technology developed in this research can not only distinguish the spatial position dependence of defect properties at GBs, but also simulate the evolution of defects away from the GB region in a coarse-grained manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Several V motion trajectories near the GBs drawn from LKMC simulation. The horizontal line indicates the GB position. Credit: Li Xiaolin\n             \n\n\nResearchers investigated the accumulation mechanisms of Vs at Fe GBs, mainly focused on the interaction processes of Vs with different GBs.\nThe results clarified the dependence of Vs accumulation on the GB character. At high temperature, the atomic processes of V emission and leakage were discovered in addition to the well-known trapping of the V by the GB. The occurrence of these processes depends on the GB character. Based on the combination of grain size, V formation energy at the GB and migration energy barrier within the GB, the coupling equation of grain size with GB character was proposed.\nWhen this equation is satisfied, the defect emission process that originally occurred in the high energy level region is inhibited by the defect cruise along the GB. This brings about the uncertainty on the relation of the radiation performance to the defect\u2013GB binding strength particularly in the case of a small grain size.\nThis work reveals new V-GB interaction processes, as well as the coupling between these processes. These results have general significance for other PC systems, which can shed light on the radiation response of PC materials, and provide a mechanism reference for experimentally optimizing the radiation resistance of materials based on GB engineering.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tXiaolin Li et al, Vacancy accumulation mechanism at iron grain boundaries: The influence of grain boundary character and its coupling with grain size, Journal of Nuclear Materials (2023).

   "text": "For the first time, researchers have demonstrated a prototype lidar system that uses quantum detection technology to acquire 3D images while submerged underwater. The high sensitivity of this system could allow it to capture detailed information even in extremely low-light conditions found underwater.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This technology could be useful for a wide range of applications,\" said research team member Aurora Maccarone, a Royal Academy of Engineering research fellow from Heriot-Watt University in the United Kingdom. \"For example, it could be used to inspect underwater installations, such as underwater wind farm cables and the submerged structure of the turbines. Underwater lidar can also be used for monitoring or surveying submerged archaeology sites and for security and defense applications.\"\nObtaining 3D images through ocean water can be challenging because it is light-limited, and any particles in the water will scatter light and distort the image. However, single-photon detection, which is a quantum-based technique, allows very high penetration and works even in low-light conditions.\nIn Optics Express, researchers from Heriot-Watt University and the University of Edinburgh describe experiments in which an entire single-photon lidar system was submerged in a large water tank. The new demonstrations bring the technology closer to practical applications compared to the research team's earlier experiments with underwater single-photon detection, which were performed in carefully controlled laboratory conditions with the optical setup placed outside the water tank and data analysis performed offline.\nThey also implemented new hardware and software developments that allow the 3D images acquired by the system to be reconstructed in real time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis animation shows a 3D profile of a pipe that was captured during the experiments with the system. Credit: Aurora Maccarone, Heriot-Watt University\n\n\"This work aims to make quantum detection technologies available for underwater applications, which means that we will be able to image the scene of interest in very low light conditions,\" said Maccarone. \"This will impact the use of offshore cable and energy installations, which are used by everyone. This technology could also allow monitoring without the presence of humans, which would mean less pollution and a less invasive presence in the marine environment.\"\nFaster low-light detection\nLidar systems create images by measuring how long it takes laser light to be reflected from objects in the scene and travel back to the system's receiver, known as the \"time of flight.\" In the new work, the researchers sought to develop a way to acquire 3D images of targets that are obscured by turbid water and thus not visible to conventional lidar imaging systems.\nThey designed a lidar system that uses a green pulsed laser source to illuminate the scene of interest. The reflected pulsed illumination is detected by an array of single-photon detectors, which allows ultrafast low light detection and greatly reduces measurement time in photon-starved environments such as highly attenuating water.\n\"By taking time-of-flight measurements with picosecond timing resolution, we can routinely resolve millimeter details of the targets in the scene,\" said Maccarone. \"Our approach also allows us to distinguish the photons reflected by the target from those reflected by particles in the water, making it particularly suitable to performing 3D imaging in highly turbid waters where optical scattering can ruin image contrast and resolution.\"\nThe fact that this approach requires thousands of single-photon detectors, all producing many hundreds of events per second, makes it extremely challenging to retrieve and process the data necessary to reconstruct the 3D image in a short time, especially for real-time applications. To solve this problem, the researchers developed algorithms specifically for imaging in highly scattering conditions and applied them in conjunction with widely available graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware.\nThe new technique builds on some important technological advances. \"Heriot-Watt University has a long track record in single\u2011photon detection techniques and image processing of single-photon data, which allowed us to demonstrate advanced single\u2011photon imaging in extremely challenging conditions,\" said Maccarone.\n\"The University of Edinburgh has achieved fundamental advances in the design and fabrication of single-photon avalanche diode detector arrays, which allowed us to build compact and robust imaging systems based on quantum detection technologies.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nUnderwater testing\nAfter optimizing the optical setup on a laboratory optical bench, the researchers connected the lidar system to a GPU to achieve real-time processing of the data while also implementing a number of image processing approaches for three-dimensional imaging. Once the system was working properly, they moved it to a tank that was 4 meters long, 3 meters wide, and 2 meters deep.\nWith the system submerged in the water, the researchers added a scattering agent in a controlled manner to make the water more turbid. Experiments at three different turbidity levels demonstrated successful imaging in controlled highly scattering scenarios at distances of 3 meters.\n\"Single-photon technologies are rapidly developing, and we have demonstrated very promising results in underwater environments,\" said Maccarone. \"The approach and image processing algorithms could also be used in a wider range of scenarios for improved vision in free space such as in fog, smoke or other obscurants.\"\nThe researchers are now working to reduce the size of the system so that it could be integrated into an underwater vehicle.

   "text": "Those Transportation Security Administration requirements are drilled into every frequent flyer's head: You can carry on liquids that are only less than 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) in volume each.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when the TSA recently confiscated a jar of Jif under this rule, peanut butter lovers were up in arms. Some skeptics of security may suspect hungry officers just wanted to make their own PB&Js. TSA, however, contends that peanut butter is a liquid\u2014and a full-size jar of Jif is over the 3.4-ounce limit.\nJust like Americans' favorite legume-based sandwich ingredient, the story\u2014and the outrage it inspired\u2014began to spread. However, I'm a mechanical engineer who studies fluid flows, and the TSA action made sense to me. By the scientific definition, peanut butter is indeed a liquid.\nFirst consider fluids\nTo define a liquid, we must first define a fluid. Any material that flows continuously when a shearing force is applied is a fluid. Think of a shearing force as a cutting action through a substance that causes it to flow continuously. For example, moving your arm causes the surrounding air to change shape\u2014or deform, to use the physics term\u2014and flow out of the way. The same thing happens to water when your arm takes a swim stroke.\nThere are many kinds of fluids. Some act very predictably and move smoothly, as air or water do. These are called Newtonian fluids, named after Sir Isaac Newton. Scientifically, a Newtonian fluid is one in which the shear force varies in direct proportion with the stress it puts on the material, known as the shearing strain. For a Newtonian fluid, the resistance to fluid flow\u2014that is, its viscosity\u2014is constant at a given temperature.\nOther types of fluids do not move quite as smoothly and easily. For some, like peanut butter, a minimum shearing or cutting force may be needed to get it flowing, and it may vary nonlinearly with shearing strain. Imagine you're stirring a jar of peanut butter. If you stir really fast, with more shearing force, the PB gets runnier, while if you stir slowly the PB remains stiff. These types of fluids are called non-Newtonian fluids. Peanut butter may stick more than flow\u2014maybe you could consider this movement more chunky-style.\nPeanut butter is actually a great example of a non-Newtonian fluid because it doesn't flow as easily as air or water but will flow if sufficient force is applied, such as when a knife spreads it on bread. How easily it flows will also depend on temperature\u2014you may have experienced peanut butter drips after slathering it on warm toast.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nStrange fluids are all around us\nOur everyday lives\u2014but not our airplane carry-ons\u2014are filled with substances that are unexpected fluids. In general, if it can flow, it's a fluid. And it will eventually take the shape of its container.\nSome surprising fluids are peanut butter's kitchen neighbors, like whipped cream, mayonnaise and cookie batter. You'll find others in the bathroom, like toothpaste. The natural world is home to other strange fluids, like lava, mudslides, avalanches and quicksand.\nGravel can be considered fluidlike. The individual particles are solids, but a collection of gravel particles can be poured and fill a container\u2014its what's called a granular fluid, because it has fluidlike properties. The same can be said for cereal poured out of a box or sugar into a bowl.\nTraffic flows on a busy highway, and people flow out of a crowded sporting venue.\nYou could even consider a cat lying in the sun to be a fluid when it has flattened out and fills its containerlike skin. Sleepy, relaxed dogs, squirrels and even zonked-out babies can meet the definition of a fluid.\nLiquids are one type of fluid\nNow, you might be objecting: But, the TSA didn't call peanut butter a fluid, they said it's a liquid!\nFluids are divided into two general categories: gases and liquids. Both gases and liquids can be deformed and poured into containers and will take the shape of their container. But gases can be compressed, while liquids cannot, at least not easily.\nPeanut butter can be poured into its container and then it deforms, or takes the shape of that container. And every 5-year-old knows that peanut butter does not compress. When they squish their PB&J or peanut butter crackers together, the peanut butter does not smoosh into a smaller volume. No\u2014it squirts out the sides and onto their hands.\nSo, the verdict on peanut butter: delicious liquid.\nIf you plan to make a PB&J sandwich midflight, count on bringing less than 3.4 ounces of liquid peanut butter. And the same goes for its liquid cousin, jelly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Conversation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

   "text": "Researchers in Singapore have developed the world's smallest LED (light-emitting diode) that enables the conversion of existing mobile phone cameras into high-resolution microscopes. Smaller than the wavelength of light, the new LED was used to build the world's smallest holographic microscope, paving the way for existing cameras in everyday devices such as mobile phones to be converted into microscopes via only modifications to the silicon chip and software. This technology also represents a significant step forward in the miniaturization of diagnostics for indoor farmers and sustainable agriculture.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis breakthrough was supplemented by the researchers' development of a revolutionary neural networking algorithm that is able to reconstruct objects measured by the holographic microscope, thus enabling enhanced examination of microscopic objects such as cells and bacteria without the need for bulky conventional microscopes or additional optics. The research also paves the way for a major advancement in photonics\u2014the building of a powerful on-chip emitter that is smaller than a micrometer, which has long been a challenge in the field.\nThe light in most photonic chips originates from off-chip sources, which leads to low overall energy efficiency and fundamentally limits the scalability of these chips. To address this issue, researchers have developed on-chip emitters using various materials such as rare-earth-doped glass, Ge-on-Si, and heterogeneously integrated III\u2013V materials. While emitters based on these materials have shown promising device performance, integrating their fabrication processes into standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) platforms remains challenging.\nWhile silicon (Si) has shown potential as a candidate material for nanoscale and individually controllable emitters, Si emitters suffer from low quantum efficiency because of the indirect bandgap, and this fundamental disadvantage combined with the limitations set by the available materials and fabrication tools has hindered the realization of a small native Si emitter in CMOS.\nIn a recently published Nature Communications paper titled \"A sub-wavelength Si LED integrated in a CMOS platform,\" SMART researchers described their development of the smallest reported Si emitter with a light intensity comparable to that of state-of-the-art Si emitters with much larger emission areas. In a related breakthrough, SMART researchers also unveiled their construction of a novel, untrained deep neural network architecture capable of reconstructing images from a holographic microscope in a paper titled \"Simultaneous spectral recovery and CMOS micro-LED holography with an untrained deep neural network\" recently published in the journal Optica.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe novel LED developed by SMART researchers is a CMOS-integrated sub-wavelength scale LED at room temperature exhibiting high spatial intensity (102 \u00b1 48 mW/cm2) and possessing the smallest emission area (0.09 \u00b1 0.04 \u03bcm2) among all known Si emitters in scientific literature. In order to demonstrate a potential practical application, the researchers then integrated this LED into an in-line, centimeter-scale, all-silicon holographic microscope requiring no lens or pinhole, integral to a field known as lensless holography.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Illustration of the process of image reconstruction using the LED, holographic microscope, and neural network. Credit: Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART)\n             \n\n\nA commonly faced obstacle in lensless holography is computational reconstruction of the imaged object. Traditional reconstruction methods require detailed knowledge of the experimental setup for accurate reconstruction and are sensitive to difficult-to-control variables such as optical aberrations, the presence of noise, and the twin image problem.\nThe research team also developed a deep neural network architecture to improve the quality of image reconstruction. This novel, untrained deep neural network incorporates total variation regularization for increased contrast and takes into account the wide spectral bandwidth of the source.\nUnlike traditional methods of computational reconstruction that require training data, this neural network eliminates the need for training by embedding a physics model within the algorithm. In addition to holographic image reconstruction, the neutral network also offers blind source spectrum recovery from a single diffracted intensity pattern, which marks a groundbreaking departure from all previous supervised learning techniques.\nThe untrained neural network demonstrated in this study allows researchers to use novel light sources without prior knowledge of the source spectrum or beam profile, such as the novel and smallest known Si LED described above, fabricated via a fully commercial, unmodified bulk CMOS microelectronics.\nThe researchers envision that this synergetic combination of CMOS micro-LEDs and the neural network can be used in other computational imaging applications, such as a compact microscope for live-cell tracking or spectroscopic imaging of biological tissues such as living plants. This work also demonstrates the feasibility of next-generation on-chip imaging systems. Already, in-line holography microscopes have been employed for a variety of applications, including particle tracking, environmental monitoring, biological sample imaging, and metrology. Further applications include arraying these LEDs in CMOS to generate programmable coherent illumination for more complex systems in the future.\nIksung Kang, lead author of the Optica paper and research assistant at MIT at the time of this research, said, \"Our breakthrough represents a proof of concept that could be hugely impactful for numerous applications requiring the use of micro-LEDs. For instance, this LED could be combined into an array for higher levels of illumination needed for larger-scale applications. In addition, due to the low cost and scalability of microelectronics CMOS processes, this can be done without increasing the system's complexity, cost, or form factor. This enables us to convert, with relative ease, a mobile phone camera into a holographic microscope of this type. Furthermore, control electronics and even the imager could be integrated into the same chip by exploiting the available electronics in the process, thus creating an all-in-one micro-LED that could be transformative for the field.\"\n\"On top of its immense potential in lensless holography, our new LED has a wide range of other possible applications. Because its wavelength is within the minimum absorption window of biological tissues, together with its high intensity and nanoscale emission area, our LED could be ideal for bio-imaging and bio-sensing applications, including near-field microscopy and implantable CMOS devices,\" added Rajeev Ram, principal investigator at SMART CAMP and DiSTAP, Professor of Electrical Engineering at MIT and co-author of both papers. \"Also, it is possible to integrate this LED with on-chip photodetectors, and it could then find further applications in on-chip communication, NIR proximity sensing, and on-wafer testing of photonics.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tZheng Li et al, A sub-wavelength Si LED integrated in a CMOS platform, Nature Communications (2023).

Using the new data, they investigated X-ray bursts on the surface of a neutron star, setting constraints on the properties of neutron stars from a new perspective.

Type-I X-ray bursts, among the brightest stellar objects frequently observed in the sky by space-based telescopes, are violent thermonuclear explosions occurring on the surfaces of neutron stars.\nDue to the strong gravity of a neutron star, hydrogen- and helium-rich matter from a companion star is accreting on the surface of the neutron star for hours or days before igniting thermonuclear burning. The explosion lasts for 10 to 100 seconds, causing a bright X-ray burst. These frequent X-ray bursts offer an opportunity to study the properties of neutron stars.\nThe bursts are powered by a nuclear reaction sequence known as the rapid proton capture nucleosynthesis process (rp-process), which involves hundreds of exotic neutron-deficient nuclides. Among them, the waiting-point nuclides, including germanium-64, play a decisive role. \"Germanium-64, like a crossroad on the path of nuclear reaction processes, is an important congested section encountered when the nuclear reaction proceeds to the medium mass region. The masses of the relevant nuclei are decisive in setting the process path and thereby the X-ray flux produced,\" explained Zhou Xu, the first author of this paper and a Ph.D. student at IMP.\nTherefore, precision mass measurements of the nuclei around germanium-64 are essential for understanding X-ray bursts and the properties of neutron stars. However, due to the extremely low production yield, it has been very challenging to measure the masses of these short-lived nuclei.\nAfter more than ten years of effort, the researchers from the Storage Ring Nuclear Physics Group at IMP have developed a new ultrasensitive mass spectrometry technique at the Cooler Storage Ring (CSR) of the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL), which is called B\u03c1-defined isochronous mass spectrometry (B\u03c1-IMS). It quickly and efficiently measures short-lived nuclei with extreme low production yield.\n\"Our experiment is capable of precisely determining the mass of a single nuclide within a millisecond after its production, and it is essentially background free in the measured spectrum,\" said Prof. Wang Meng from IMP.\nThe researchers precisely measured the masses of arsenic-64, arsenic-65, selenium-66, selenium-67 and germanium-63. The masses of arsenic-64 and selenium-66 are the first experimental results in the world, and the mass precision of the others have all been improved. With the newly measured masses, all nuclear reaction energy related to the waiting point nucleus germanium-64 has been experimentally determined for the first time.\nThe researchers used the new masses as inputs for X-ray burst model calculations. They found that the new data lead to changes in the rp-process path. As a result, the X-ray burst light curve on the surface of the neutron star has an increased peak luminosity and a prolonged tail duration.\nBy comparing model calculations with the observed X-ray bursts of GS 1826-24, the researchers found that the distance from Earth to the burster should be increased by 6.5%, and the neutron star surface gravitational redshift coefficient needs to be reduced by 4.8% to match astronomical observations, which indicates that the density of the neutron star is lower than expected. In addition, the composition changes of the rp-process reaction products revealed that the temperature of the outer shell of the neutron star should be higher than generally believed after the X-ray burst.\nThe property of neutron stars is a frontier physics research topic of great importance. \"Through precise nuclear mass measurement, we obtained a more accurate X-ray burst light curve on the surface of the neutron star. By comparing it with astronomical observations, we set constrains on the relationship between the mass and radius of the neutron star from a new perspective,\" said Prof. Zhang Yuhu from IMP.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tX.

   "text": "Researchers in Germany and the U.S. have shown for the first time that terahertz (THz) light pulses can stabilize ferromagnetism in a crystal at temperatures more than three times its usual transition temperature. As the team reports in Nature, using pulses just hundreds of femtoseconds long (a millionth of a billionth of a second), a ferromagnetic state was induced at high temperature in the rare-earth titanate YTiO3 which persisted for many nanoseconds after the light exposure. Below the equilibrium transition temperature, the laser pulses still strengthened the existing magnetic state, increasing the magnetization up to its theoretical limit.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing light to control magnetism in solids is a promising platform for future technologies. Today's computers mainly rely on the flow of electrical charge to process information. Moreover, digital memory storage devices make use of magnetic bits that must be switched external magnetic fields. Both of these aspects limit the speed and energy efficiency of current computing systems. Using light instead to optically switch memory and computing devices could revolutionize processing speeds and efficiency.\nYTiO3 is a transition metal oxide that only becomes ferromagnetic, with properties resembling those of a fridge magnet, below 27 K or \u2013246\u00b0C. At these low temperatures, the spins of the electrons on the Ti atoms align in a particular direction. It is this collective ordering of the spins which gives the material as a whole a macroscopic magnetization and turns it ferromagnetic. In contrast, at temperatures above 27 K, the individual spins fluctuate randomly so that no ferromagnetism develops.\nUsing a powerful THz light source developed at the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter (MPSD) in Hamburg, Germany, the team managed to achieve ferromagnetism in YTiO3 up to nearly 100 K (\u2245193\u00b0C), far above its normal transition temperature. The light-induced state also persisted for many nanoseconds. The intense light pulse is designed to \"shake\" the material's atoms in a coordinated way, allowing the electrons to align their spins.\n\"The frequencies of the pulses are tuned to drive specific vibrations of the YTiO3 crystal lattice, called phonons,\" explains lead author Ankit Disa. \"We found that when we excite one particular phonon at its natural frequency of 9 THz, the collective order of the spins and the orbitals of the electrons are modified, leading to a stronger tendency towards a ferromagnetic state. When driving other phonons, we observed totally different results: Excitation of a phonon at 4 THz actually worsens the ferromagnetism and of one at 17 THz enhances it\u2014but not as strongly as the 9 THz phonon does.\"\nBelow the usual transition temperature of 27 K, the 9 THz phonon excitation significantly increased the magnetization, raising it by around 20% to its theoretical maximum\u2014a level that had not been achieved to date.\nThe THz source used in these experiments delivers intense pulses and is capable of exciting a very narrow frequency region in the material, making it an extremely precise tool. It has already been deployed in several other MPSD-led studies on light-enhanced superconductivity and magnetism. However, this work revealed for the first time that qualitatively different effects can be produced by exciting a range of lattice vibrations.\nApart from deepening scientists' understanding of intense and ultrafast light-matter interactions, these results are important stepping stones towards the optical control of magnetic components. \"This work does not only demonstrate the switching of magnetism on and off on demand, it also gives us a foretaste of what could be done to store and process information at ultra-high speeds,\" explains Andrea Cavalleri, Director of the MPSD's Condensed Matter Dynamics Department.\n\"Beyond this demonstration, our work underscores the ability to create order in disordered, fluctuating phases of matter, something akin to freezing water with light. Controlling these processes has been a long-standing goal of our group. Over the years we have reported a number of other realizations that flank this work, including photo-induced high temperature superconductivity and photo-induced ferroelectricity.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA.

A gate can, for example, be an AND operation, i.e., an operation that adds two bits. These gates, and thus computers, are irreversible. That is, algorithms cannot simply run backwards. \"If you take the multiplication 2x2=4, you cannot simply run this operation in reverse, because 4 could be 2x2, but likewise 1x4 or 4x1,\" explains Wolfgang Lechner, professor of theoretical physics at the University of Innsbruck. If this were possible, however, it would be feasible to factorize large numbers, i.e., divide them into their factors.\nMartin Lanthaler, Ben Niehoff and Wolfgang Lechner from the Institut f\u00fcr Theoretische Physik at the University of Innsbruck and the quantum spin-off ParityQC have now developed exactly this inversion of algorithms with the help of quantum computers. The starting point is a classical logic circuit, which multiplies two numbers. If two integers are entered as the input value, the circuit returns their product. Such a circuit is built from irreversible operations. \"However, the logic of the circuit can be encoded within ground states of a quantum system,\" explains Martin Lanthaler from Wolfgang Lechner's team. \"Thus, both multiplication and factorization can be understood as ground-state problems and solved using quantum optimization methods.\"\nSuperposition of all possible results\n\"The core of our work is the encoding of the basic building blocks of the multiplier circuit, specifically AND gates, half and full adders with the parity architecture as the ground state problem on an ensemble of interacting spins,\" says Martin Lanthaler.\nThe coding allows the entire circuit to be built from repeating subsystems that can be arranged on a two-dimensional grid. By stringing several of these subsystems together, larger problem instances can be realized. Instead of the classical brute force method, where all possible factors are tested, quantum methods can speed up the search process: To find the ground state, and thus solve an optimization problem, it is not necessary to search the whole energy landscape, but deeper valleys can be reached by \"tunneling.\"\nThe current research work provides a blueprint for a new type of quantum computer to solve the factorization problem, a cornerstone of modern cryptography.

The developed approaches for achieving electrically driven light amplification with solution-cast nanocrystals might help resolve a long-standing challenge of integrating photonic and electronic circuits on the same silicon chip and is poised to advance many other fields ranging from lighting and displays to quantum information, medical diagnostics and chemical sensing.\"\nMore than two decades of research\nResearch over more than two decades has sought to achieve colloidal quantum dot lasing with electrical pumping, a prerequisite for its widespread use in practical technologies. Traditional laser diodes, ubiquitous in modern technologies, produce highly monochromatic, coherent light under electrical excitation. But they have deficiencies: challenges with scalability, gaps in the range of accessible wavelengths, and, importantly an incompatibility with silicon technologies that limits their use in microelectronics. Those problems have spurred the search for alternatives in the realm of highly flexible and easily scalable solution-processable materials.\nChemically prepared colloidal quantum dots are especially attractive for implementing solution-processable laser diodes. In addition to being compatible with inexpensive and readily scalable chemical techniques, they offer the advantages of a size-tunable emission wavelength, low-optical gain thresholds and high-temperature stability of lasing characteristics.\nHowever, multiple challenges have hindered the technology's development, including fast Auger recombination of gain-active multicarrier states, poor stability of nanocrystal films at high current densities required for lasing, and the difficulty of obtaining net optical gain in a complex electrically driven device wherein a thin electroluminescent nanocrystal layer is combined with various optically-lossy, charge-conducting layers that tends to absorb light emitted by the nanocrystals.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions for colloidal quantum dot laser diode challenges\nA number of technical challenges needed to be solved to realize electrically driven colloidal quantum dot lasing. Quantum dots not only need to emit light, they need to multiply generated photons via stimulated emission. That effect can be turned into laser oscillations, or lasing, by combining the quantum dots with an optical resonator that would circulate the emitted light through the gain medium. Solve that, and you have electrically driven quantum dot lasing.\nIn quantum dots, stimulated emission competes with very fast nonradiative Auger recombination, the primary impediment of lasing in these materials. The Los Alamos team developed a highly effective approach to suppress nonradiative Auger decay by introducing carefully engineered compositional gradients into the quantum dot interior.\nVery high current densities are also required for attaining the lasing regime. That current, though, can doom a device.\n\"A typical quantum dot light-emitting diode operates at current densities that do not exceed about 1 ampere per square centimeter,\" said Namyoung Ahn, a Los Alamos Director's Postdoctoral Fellow and the lead device design expert for the project. \"However, the realization of lasing requires tens to hundreds of amperes per square centimeter, which would normally lead to device breakdown due to overheating. This has been a key problem hindering realization of lasing with electrical pumping.\"\nTo resolve the overheating problem, the team confined the electric current in spatial and temporal domains, ultimately reducing the amount of generated heat and simultaneously improving heat exchange with a surrounding medium. To implement these ideas, the researchers incorporated an insulating interlayer with a small, current-focusing aperture into a device stack and used short electrical pulses (about 1 microsecond duration) to drive the LEDs.\nThe developed devices were able to reach unprecedented current densities of up to approximately 2,000 amperes per square centimeter, sufficient to generate strong, broad-band optical gain spanning across multiple quantum dot optical transitions.\n\"A further challenge is to achieve a favorable balance between optical gain and optical losses in a complete LED device stack containing various charge conducting layers that can exhibit strong light absorption,\" said Laboratory postdoctoral researcher Cl\u00e9ment Livache, who coordinated the spectroscopic component of this project. \"To tackle this problem, we added a stack of dielectric bi-layers, forming a so-called distributed Bragg reflector.\"\nUsing a Bragg reflector as an underlying substrate, the researchers were able to control a spatial distribution of an electric field across the device and shape it so as to reduce field intensity in optically lossy charge conductive layers and to enhance the field in the quantum-dot gain medium.\nWith those innovations, the team demonstrated an effect pursued by the research community for decades: bright amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) realized with electrically pumped colloidal quantum dots. In the ASE process, \"seed photons\" produced by spontaneous emission launch a \"photon avalanche\" driven by stimulated emission from the excited quantum dots. This boosts the intensity of the emitted light, increases its directionality and enhances coherence. ASE can be considered as a precursor of lasing, the effect which emerges when an ASE-capable medium is combined with an optical resonator.\nThe ASE-type quantum dot LEDs represent considerable practical utility as sources of highly directional, narrow-band light for applications in consumer products (for example, displays and projectors), metrology, imaging and scientific instrumentation. Interesting opportunities are also associated with the prospective use of these structures in electronics and photonics, traditional and quantum, where they can help realize spectrally tunable on-chip optical amplifiers integrated with various types of optical interconnects and photonic structures.\nWhat's next?\nPresently, the team is working on realizing laser oscillations with electrically pumped quantum dots. In one approach, they incorporate into the devices a so-called \"distributed feedback grating,\" a periodic structure that acts as an optical resonator circulating light in the quantum dot medium. The team also aims to extend spectral coverage of their devices, with a focus on demonstrating electrically driven light-amplification in the range of infrared wavelengths.\nInfrared, solution-processable optical-gain devices could be of great utility in silicon technologies, communications, imaging and sensing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNamyoung Ahn et al, Electrically driven amplified spontaneous emission from colloidal quantum dots, Nature (2023).

However, these fibers are not well-suited for guiding extremely high-power laser beams due to glass damage and scattering of laser energy out of the fiber. Additionally, the need for a physical support structure means that glass fiber must be laid down long in advance of light signal transmission or collection.\nHoward Milchberg and his group in UMD's Departments of Physics and Electrical & Computer Engineering and Institute for Research in Electronics & Applied Physics have demonstrated an optical guiding method that beats both limitations, using auxiliary ultrashort laser pulses to sculpt fiber optic waveguides in the air itself.\nThese short pulses form a ring of high-intensity light structures called \"filaments,\" which heat the air molecules to form an extended ring of low-density heated air surrounding a central undisturbed region; this is exactly the refractive index structure of an optical fiber. With air itself as the fiber, very high average powers can potentially be guided. And for collection of remote optical signals for detecting pollutants and radioactive sources, for example, the air waveguide can be arbitrarily \"unspooled\" and directed at the speed of light in any direction.\nIn an experiment published in January in Physical Review X, graduate student Andrew Goffin and colleagues from Milchberg's group showed that this technique can form 50-meter-long air waveguides that persist for tens of milliseconds until they dissipate from cooling by the surrounding air.\nGenerated using only one watt of average laser power, these waveguides could theoretically guide megawatt average power laser beams, making them exceptional candidates for directed energy. The waveguide method is straightforwardly scalable to 1 kilometer and longer. However, the waveguide-generating laser in that work fired a pulse every 100 milliseconds (repetition rate of 10 Hz), with cooling dissipation over 30 milliseconds, leaving 70 milliseconds between shots with no air waveguide present. This is an impediment to guiding a continuous wave laser or collecting a continuous optical signal.\nIn a new Memorandum in Optica, Andrew Goffin, Andrew Tartaro, and Milchberg show that by increasing the repetition rate of the waveguide-generating pulse up to 1000 Hz (a pulse every millisecond), the air waveguide is continuously maintained by heating and deepening the waveguide faster than the surrounding air can cool it. The result is a continuously operating air waveguide that can guide an injected continuous wave laser beam. Because the waveguide is deepened by repetitive generation, guided light confinement efficiency improves by a factor of three at the highest repetition rate.\nContinuous wave optical guiding significantly improves the utility of air waveguides: it increases the maximum average laser power one can transport and maintains the guiding structure for use in continuous collection of remote optical signals. And because kilometer-scale and longer waveguides are wider, cooling is slower and a repetition rate well below 1 kHz will be needed to maintain the guide. This more lenient requirement makes continuous air waveguiding over kilometer and longer ranges easily achievable with existing laser technology and modest power levels.\n\"With an appropriate laser system for generating the waveguide, long-distance continuous guiding should be easily doable,\" said Goffin. \"Once we have that, it's just a matter of time before we're transmitting high power continuous laser beams and detecting pollutants from miles away.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA.

   "text": "Two-photon microscopy (TPM) has revolutionized the field of biology by enabling researchers to observe complex biological processes in living tissues at high resolution. In contrast to traditional fluorescence microscopy techniques, TPM makes use of low-energy photons to excite fluorescent molecules for observation. This, in turn, makes it possible to penetrate the tissue much more deeply, and ensures that the fluorescent molecules, or fluorophores, are not permanently damaged by the excitation laser.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, some biological processes are simply too fast to be recorded, even with state-of-the-art TPMs. One of the design parameters that limits the performance of a TPM is the line scanning frequency, measured as frames per second (FPS). This refers to the rate at which the target sample can be swept across by the excitation laser along one direction (for instance, in a horizontal sweep). A slow scanning frequency also impacts the overall FPS of the system, since it determines how fast the laser can be swept across the other direction, i.e. in a vertical sweep. Together, these create a tradeoff between the microscope's temporal resolution and the size of the observation frame.\nWorking around this problem, an international team of researchers from China and Germany recently developed a powerful TPM setup with an unprecedentedly high line scanning frequency. According to their report published in Neurophotonics, this microscopy system was designed for imaging fast biological processes at a high temporal as well as spatial resolution.\nOne of the key factors that distinguish the proposed TPM from the conventional ones is the use of acousto-optic deflectors (AODs) to control the scanning of the excitation laser. An AOD is a special type of crystal whose refractive index can be precisely controlled by acoustic waves. This, in turn, allows us to redirect a laser beam through it as desired. More importantly, AODs enable a faster laser-steering than that obtained with the galvanometers used in conventional TPMs.\nAccordingly, the team designed a custom AOD with an exceptionally high acoustic velocity using a tellurium dioxide (TeO2) crystal, achieving a high line scanning frequency. With this AOD, the laser could scan a line in the frame within a mere 2.5 microseconds, corresponding to a maximum line scanning frequency of 400 kHz. Similarly, the team used an AOD to achieve a reasonable slow scanning frequency in the other direction.\nTo further improve the adaptability of their microscope, the team added the option of switching to a galvanometer-based laser scanning mechanism when necessary. This allowed the scanning of large regions of the sample at an acceptable resolution and speed, making it easier to locate small areas of interest before switching to AOD scanning.\nThe team conducted several proof-of-concept experiments with the newly designed TPM. They installed cranial windows on genetically engineered mice and used them to observe the morphology and activity of neurons as well as the movement of single red blood cells (RBCs). The system achieved a frame rate of up to 10,000 FPS using an appropriate AOD configuration and frame size. This was sufficient to precisely measure the velocity at which calcium propagates in neuronal dendrites as well as to visualize the trajectory of individual RBCs within blood vessels.\nImpressed by these results, Dr. Na Ji, Associate Editor of Neurophotonics and Luis Alvarez Memorial Chair in Experimental Physics at UC Berkeley, remarks, \"The new system for AOD-based scanning microscopy represents a substantial improvement in imaging speed and performance, as demonstrated in its application for calcium signal propagation and blood flow measurements in the brain in vivo.\"\nGoing forward, the new proof-of-concept TPM design will make it possible to capture fast biological processes, and could significantly improve our understanding of them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRuijie Li et al, Ten-kilohertz two-photon microscopy imaging of single-cell dendritic activity and hemodynamics in vivo, Neurophotonics (2023).

To accomplish all three at once, the researchers developed a technique known as image-free single-pixel object detection (SPOD). In Optics Letters, they report that SPOD can achieve an object detection accuracy of just over 80%.\nThe SPOD technique builds on the research group's previous accomplishments in developing imaging-free sensing technology as efficient scene perception technology. Their prior work includes image-free classification, segmentation and character recognition based on a single-pixel detector.\n\"For autonomous driving, SPOD could be used with lidar to help improve scene reconstruction speed and object detection accuracy,\" said Bian. \"We believe that it has a high enough detection rate and accuracy for autonomous driving while also reducing the transmission bandwidth and computing resource requirements needed for object detection.\"\nDetection without images\nAutomating advanced visual tasks\u2014whether used to navigate a vehicle or track a moving plane\u2014usually require detailed images of a scene to extract the features necessary to identify an object. However, this requires either complex imaging hardware or complicated reconstruction algorithms, which leads to high computational cost, long running time and heavy data transmission load. For this reason, the traditional image first, perceive later approaches may not be best for object detection.\n\n\n\n\n\n                The researchers showed that SPOD achieves a detection accuracy of 82.41% mAP at a sampling rate of 5% with a refresh rate of 63 FPS. Visualization results are pictured. Credit: Lintao Peng, Beijing Institute of Technology\n             \n\n\nImage-free sensing methods based on single-pixel detectors can cut down on the computational power needed for object detection. Instead of employing a pixelated detector such as a CMOS or CCD, single-pixel imaging illuminates the scene with a sequence of structured light patterns and then records the transmitted light intensity to acquire the spatial information of objects. This information is then used to computationally reconstruct the object or to calculate its properties.\nFor SPOD, the researchers used a small but optimized structured light pattern to quickly scan the entire scene and obtain 2D measurements. These measurements are fed into a deep learning model known as a transformer-based encoder to extract the high-dimensional meaningful features in the scene. These features are then fed into a multi-scale attention network-based decoder, which outputs the class, location and size information of all targets in the scene simultaneously.\n\"Compared to the full-size pattern used by other single-pixel detection methods, the small, optimized pattern produces better image-free sensing performance,\" said group member Lintao Peng. \"Also, the multi-scale attention network in the SPOD decoder reinforces the network's attention to the target area in the scene. This allows more efficient extraction of scene features, enabling state-of-the art object detection performance.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nProof-of-concept demonstration\nTo experimentally demonstrate SPOD, the researchers built a proof-of-concept setup. Images randomly selected from the Pascal Voc 2012 test dataset were printed on film and used as target scenes. When a sampling rate of 5% was used, the average time to complete spatial light modulation and image-free object detection per scene with SPOD was just 0.016 seconds.\nThis is much faster than performing scene reconstruction first (0.05 seconds) and then object detection (0.018 seconds. SPOD showed an average detection accuracy of 82.2% for all the object classes included in the test dataset.\n\"Currently, SPOD cannot detect every possible object category because the existing object detection dataset used to train the model only contains 80 categories,\" said Peng. \"However, when faced with a specific task, the pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to achieve image-free multi-object detection of new target classes for applications such as pedestrian, vehicle or boat detection.\"\nNext, the researchers plan to extend the image-free perception technology to other kinds of detectors and computational acquisition systems to achieve reconstruction-free sensing technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLintao Peng et al, Image-free single-pixel object detection, Optics Letters (2023).

   "text": "Inside a lab, scientists marvel at a strange state that forms when they cool down atoms to nearly absolute zero. Outside their window, trees gather sunlight and turn them into new leaves. The two seem unrelated\u2014but a new study from the University of Chicago suggests that these processes aren't so different as they might appear on the surface.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study, published in PRX Energy on April 28, found links at the atomic level between photosynthesis and exciton condensates\u2014a strange state of physics that allows energy to flow frictionlessly through a material. The finding is scientifically intriguing and may suggest new ways to think about designing electronics, the authors said.\n\"As far as we know, these areas have never been connected before, so we found this very compelling and exciting,\" said study co-author Prof. David Mazziotti.\nMazziotti's lab specializes in modeling the complicated interactions of atoms and molecules as they display interesting properties. There's no way to see these interactions with the naked eye, so computer modeling can give scientists a window into why the behavior happens\u2014and can also provide a foundation for designing future technology.\nIn particular, Mazziotti and study co-authors Anna Schouten and LeeAnn Sager-Smith have been modeling what happens at the molecular level when photosynthesis occurs.\nWhen a photon from the sun strikes a leaf, it sparks a change in a specially designed molecule. The energy knocks loose an electron. The electron, and the \"hole\" where it once was, can now travel around the leaf, carrying the energy of the sun to another area where it triggers a chemical reaction to make sugars for the plant.\nTogether, that traveling electron-and-hole-pair is referred to as an \"exciton.\" When the team took a birds-eye view and modeled how multiple excitons move around, they noticed something odd. They saw patterns in the paths of the excitons that looked remarkably familiar.\nIn fact, it looked very much like the behavior in a material that is known as a Bose-Einstein condensate, sometimes known as \"the fifth state of matter.\" In this material, excitons can link up into the same quantum state\u2014kind of like a set of bells all ringing perfectly in tune. This allows energy to move around the material with zero friction. (These sorts of strange behaviors intrigue scientists because they can be the seeds for remarkable technology\u2014for example, a similar state called superconductivity is the basis for MRI machines).\nAccording to the models created by Schouten, Sager-Smith and Mazziotti, the excitons in a leaf can sometimes link up in ways similar to exciton condensate behavior.\nThis was a huge surprise. Exciton condensates have only been seen when the material is cooled down significantly below room temperature. It'd be kind of like seeing ice cubes forming in a cup of hot coffee.\n\"Photosynthetic light harvesting is taking place in a system that is at room temperature and what's more, its structure is disordered\u2014very unlike the pristine crystallized materials and cold temperatures that you use to make exciton condensates,\" explained Schouten.\nThis effect isn't total\u2014it's more akin to \"islands\" of condensates forming, the scientists said. \"But that's still enough to enhance energy transfer in the system,\" said Sager-Smith. In fact, their models suggest it can as much as double the efficiency.\nThis opens up some new possibilities for generating synthetic materials for future technology, Mazziotti said. \"A perfect ideal exciton condensate is sensitive and requires a lot of special conditions, but for realistic applications, it's exciting to see something that boosts efficiency but can happen in ambient conditions.\"\nMazziotti said the finding also plays into a broader approach his team has been exploring for a decade.\nThe interactions between atoms and molecules in processes like photosynthesis are incredibly complex\u2014difficult even for a supercomputer to handle\u2014so scientists have traditionally had to simplify their models in order to get a handle on them. But Mazziotti thinks some parts need to be left in: \"We think local correlation of electrons are essential to capturing how nature actually works.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnna O.

The results not only explain what gives champagne its line of bubbles but may hold important implications for understanding bubbly flows in the field of fluid mechanics.\n\"This is the type of research that I've been working out for years,\" said Brown engineering professor Roberto Zenit, who was one of the paper's authors. \"Most people have never seen an ocean seep or an aeration tank but most of them have had a soda, a beer or a glass of champagne. By talking about champagne and beer, our master plan is to make people understand that fluid mechanics is important in their daily lives.\"\nThe team's goal was to investigate the stability of bubble chains in carbonated drinks. Part of the signature experience of enjoying these beverages is the tiny or large bubbles that form when the drink is poured, creating a visible chain of bubbles and fizz. Depending on the drink and its ingredients, the fluid mechanics involved are all different.\nWhen it comes to champagne and sparkling wine, for instance, the gas bubbles that continuously appear rise rapidly to the top in a single-file line and keep doing so for some time. This is known as a stable bubble chain. With other carbonated drinks, like beer, many bubbles veer off to the side, making it look like multiple bubbles are coming up at once. This means the bubble chain isn't stable.\nThe researchers set out to explore the mechanics of what makes bubble chains stable and if they could recreate them, making unstable chains as stable as they are in champagne or prosecco.\nThe results of their experiments indicate that the stable bubble chains in champagne and other sparkling wines occur due to ingredients that act as soap-like compounds called surfactants. These surfactant-like molecules help reduce the tensions between the liquid and the gas bubbles, making for a smooth rise to the top.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"The theory is that in champagne these contaminants that act as surfactants are the good stuff,\" said Zenit, senior author on the paper. \"These protein molecules that give flavor and uniqueness to the liquid are what makes the bubbles chains they produce stable.\"\nThe experiments also showed the stability of bubbles is impacted by the size of the bubbles themselves. They found that the chains with large bubbles have a wake similar to that of bubbles with contaminants, leading to a smooth rise and stable chains.\nIn beverages, however, bubbles are always small. It makes surfactants the key ingredient to producing straight and stable chains. Beer, for example, also contains surfactant-like molecules but, depending on the type of beer, the bubbles can rise in straight chains or not. In contrast, bubbles in carbonated water are always unstable since there are no contaminants helping the bubbles move smoothly through the wake flows left behind by the other bubbles in the chain.\n\"This wake, this velocity disturbance, causes the bubbles to be knocked out,\" Zenit said. \"Instead of having one line, the bubbles end up going up in more of a cone.\"\nThe results in the new study go well beyond understanding the science that goes into celebratory toasts, the researchers said. The findings provide a general framework in fluid mechanics for understanding the formation of clusters in bubbly flows, which have economic and societal value.\nTechnologies that use bubble-induced mixing, like aeration tanks at water treatment facilities, for instance, would benefit greatly from researchers having a clearer understanding of how bubbles cluster, their origins and how to predict their appearance. In nature, understanding these flows may help better explain ocean seeps in which methane and carbon dioxide emerges from the bottom of the ocean.\nThe experiments the research team ran were relatively straightforward\u2014and some could even be run in any local pub. To observe the bubble chains, the researchers poured glasses of carbonated beverages including Pellegrino sparkling water, Tecate beer, Charles de Cazanove champagne and a Spanish-style brut.\nTo study the bubble chains and what goes into making them stable, they filled a small rectangular plexiglass container with liquid and inserted a needle at the bottom so they could pump in gas to create different kinds of bubble chains.\nThe researchers then gradually added surfactants or increased bubble size. They found that when they made the bubbles larger, they could make unstable bubble chains become stable, even without surfactants. When they kept a fixed bubble size and only added surfactants, they found they could also go from unstable chains to stable ones.\nThe two experiments indicate that there are two distinct possibilities to stabilize a bubble chain: adding surfactants and making bubbles bigger, the researchers explain in the paper.\nThe researchers performed numerical simulations on a computer to explain some of the questions they couldn't explain through the physical experiments, such as calculating how much of the surfactants go into the gas bubbles, the weight of the bubbles and their precise velocity.\nThey plan to keep looking into the mechanics of stable bubble chains in an effort to apply them to different aspects of fluid mechanics, especially in bubbly flows.\n\"We're interested in how these bubbles move and their relationship to industrial applications and in nature,\" Zenit said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOmer Atasi et al, Presence of surfactants controls the stability of bubble chains in carbonated drinks, Physical Review Fluids (2023).

   "text": "In the ceaseless pursuit of energy-efficient computing, new devices designed at UC Santa Barbara show promise for enhancements in information processing and data storage.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers in the lab of Kaustav Banerjee, a professor of electrical and computer engineering, have published a new paper describing several of these devices, \"Quantum-engineered devices based on 2D materials for next-generation information processing and storage,\" in the journal Advanced Materials. Arnab Pal, who recently received his doctorate, is the lead author.\nEach device is intended to address challenges associated with conventional computing in a new way. All four operate at very low voltages and are characterized as being low leakage, as opposed to the conventional metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) found in smartphones that drain power even when turned off. But because they are based on processing steps similar to those used to make MOSFETs, the new devices could be produced at scale using existing industry-standard manufacturing processes for semiconductors.\nThe most promising of the two information-processing devices, according to Banerjee, is the spin-based field-effect transistor, or spin-FET, which takes advantage of the magnetic moment\u2014or spin\u2014of the electrons that power the device. In this case, the materials belong to the transition metal dichalcogenide group of compounds, which are based on transition metals.\nUnlike the spin-FET, the charge-based field-effect transistor, or TFET, operates by taking advantage of the quantum-mechanical nature of electrons. As the result of a phenomenon known as wave-function penetration, the electrons are able to tunnel through a thin electrical barrier instead of flowing over it, as occurs in a conventional transistor. TFETs can also operate at lower voltages, consuming less power and generating less heat. TFETs made with 2D materials perform better because of their thinner and more controllable electronic tunneling barrier, which both enhances electron flow and allows the device to perform with greater precision.\nIn order for data to be stored securely, a device's hard drive has to be programmed so that storage is maintained even when the power is off. To do this with a normal MOSFET, Pal said, \"You have the source (electrons) and the drain (where the electrons are collected) and then the channel between them, which controls the flow of those carriers. The channel either acts as a barrier so that the electrons can't go across\u2014the off state\u2014or is very conductive so that they can cross, i.e., the on state. To generate flow in a normal n-type device requires application of a positive gate bias\u2014voltage\u2014that attracts the negatively charged electrons from the source across the channel.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the charge-based floating-gate field-effect-transistor (FG-FET) information-storage device works on a principle similar to that asS a MOSFET, but rather than having just one gate electrode, it has two. The extra electrode is called a floating gate. When a MOSFET is unprogrammed, there is no additional charge on the floating gate. However, during any programming operation, a very strong voltage is applied at the gate, causing many carriers (electrons) to be pulled from the channel and deposited there, where they become trapped. This accumulated negative gate charge makes it difficult to turn the device on, thereby programming it to be off. \nThere are challenges to this method, according to the researchers. One of them, Pal said, is \"pulling a lot of charge to the floating gate, which requires a lot of power.\" Further, added Banerjee, \"In order for those electrons to arrive at the floating gate to program the device, they have to tunnel through a dielectric layer. And once there, they can also leak back, creating an issue of charge retention.\"\nAn array of charge-based and non-charge-based devices built with 2D materials may enable next-generation information processing and storage technologies.\nAnother issue is that if many FG-FETs are placed close together\u2014and, said Pal, \"We want to put as many on the chip as possible to, for instance, increase the capacity of a thumb drive\"\u2014the stored charges on the devices interact with each other, affecting the neighboring device. Using ultra-thin 2D materials minimizes this interaction while increasing the control over the individual devices, thereby delivering high performance even when more devices are more densely concentrated on the chip.\nAnother approach to information storage is through the use of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), which take advantage of electron spin to store data. An MTJ consists of two magnetic layers separated by a thin insulating layer; the relative orientation of the magnetic moments of the layers determines the resistance of the device. However, similar to FG-FETs, MTJs face challenges related to power consumption, stability and scalability. Here again, ultra-thin 2D-materials offer a potential solution by reducing interactions among neighboring MTJs, thus enabling efficient, high-density data storage.\nWhile the devices based on 2D materials can yield improvements in terms of energy and area efficiency over those made with conventional materials, extraordinary improvements can be achieved only by changing the computing architecture. Enter the radical new architecture known as quantum computing. Based on the quantum superposition of quantum bits, called qubits, quantum computing generates parallel computations to yield massive performance gains in both speed and efficiency for select computing tasks.\nThe unique structural and electromagnetic properties of 2D materials that enable efficiency gains for the more conventional charge-based qubits also make it possible to efficiently design several other newer types of qubits, called spin-, valley-, and spin-valley qubits.\nIn a spin qubit, the property of the state (on/off) is defined by the electron spin, or quantum state, of the qubit, which is always either spin up or spin down. The state is changed by flipping the spin, from up to down or vice versa, to change the state of the qubit and support qubit operation.\nThe valley qubit operates somewhat differently. Its state is determined by the momentum of the electron, rather than its spin. The change in the electron momentum is translated to a change in the qubit state, helping to realize qubit operation.\nFinally, the properties of 2D materials can also help in realizing the third type of qubit, the spin-valley qubit, the states of which are defined by both the momentum and the spin of the electrons. Because spin-valley qubits couple these two degrees of freedom, they are assumed to be more resilient to decoherence, thereby allowing longer and more complex quantum computations to be performed before quantum entanglement is lost.\n\"The emerging devices, enabled by the unique properties of 2D materials, offer the promise of energy-efficient high-performance computing and storage,\" Pal said, \"enabling beyond-Moore integration and sparking new explorations in solid-state physics and their applications.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArnab Pal et al, Quantum\u2010Engineered Devices Based on 2D Materials for Next\u2010Generation Information Processing and Storage, Advanced Materials (2022).

By connecting several of these toys with an elastic silicon rubber chain, the resulting structure is \"elastoactive.\" This means that it will return to its original shape after being deformed, while the self-propelling, active constituents that it is comprised of constantly try to push the structure in a certain direction.\nDepending on the size of the chain links and whether the chains were fixed at one or both ends, the elastoactive chains showed a range of movement types, including self-oscillatory, self-synchronizing and self-snapping.\n\"By experimenting with these elastoactive chains, we discovered that there is an interplay between activity and elasticity: when activity dominates, the chains self-oscillate and synchronize,\" says Corentin Coulais, head of the Machine Materials Laboratory at the University of Amsterdam.\nHe continues, \"Mechanical self-oscillation and synchronization are a key feature of biological machines, features that are useful for making new types of autonomous robots.

Credit: Ellen Zheng\n\nSelf-oscillation, self-synchronization and self-snapping\nWhen a structure self-oscillates, this means that it bends back and forth by itself. In the chains, the microbots might start by bending the chain to the left. However, because the chain is pinned at one end, the elastic links resist this movement, reorienting the bots in such a way that they start pushing and bending the chain to the right. This movement will again be resisted by the elastic chain, until the bots start moving to the left again.\nSynchronization happens when two elastoactive chains are connected at one end by a stiff enough rod. By wriggling around, the two connected chains automatically start oscillating with the same frequency, like sea grasses moved by the same waves.\nFinally, taking a single elastoactive chain and pinning both of its ends, it shows \"self-snapping\" behavior. When you bend a playing card with your fingers, you can make it \"snap\" to bending the other way by pushing hard enough from the side. The elastoactive chains do this by themselves, repeatedly snapping from bending to the left to bending to the right.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nInstructive play\n\"We started this research by just playing around with the microbot toys. But more generally, the idea was to explore materials out of equilibrium. In soft matter, active fluids have been studied extensively in the last 25 years, but their solid counterparts were investigated much less,\" says Coulais.\nNext on the menu is exploring elastoactive behavior at smaller scales, for instance in so-called colloidal systems, consisting of small particles suspended in a fluid. Even though these are still model systems, they are closer to the biological system due to similar length scales and the presence of the fluid. At any scale, it would also be interesting to use smart design to embed multiple self-oscillations within a single structure to obtain more complex movement patterns. With a better understanding of self-oscillations, the hope is that it becomes possible to create new types of autonomous robots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEllen Zheng et al, Self-Oscillation and Synchronization Transitions in Elastoactive Structures, Physical Review Letters (2023).

   "text": "Using a \"spooky\" phenomenon of quantum physics, Caltech researchers have discovered a way to double the resolution of light microscopes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a paper appearing in the journal Nature Communications, a team led by Lihong Wang, Bren Professor of Medical Engineering and Electrical Engineering, shows the achievement of a leap forward in microscopy through what is known as quantum entanglement. Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two particles are linked such that the state of one particle is tied to the state of the other particle regardless of whether the particles are anywhere near each other. Albert Einstein famously referred to quantum entanglement as \"spooky action at a distance\" because it could not be explained by his relativity theory.\nAccording to quantum theory, any type of particle can be entangled. In the case of Wang's new microscopy technique, dubbed quantum microscopy by coincidence (QMC), the entangled particles are photons. Collectively, two entangled photons are known as a biphoton, and, importantly for Wang's microscopy, they behave in some ways as a single particle that has double the momentum of a single photon.\nSince quantum mechanics says that all particles are also waves, and that the wavelength of a wave is inversely related to the momentum of the particle, particles with larger momenta have smaller wavelengths. So, because a biphoton has double the momentum of a photon, its wavelength is half that of the individual photons.\nThis is key to how QMC works. A microscope can only image the features of an object whose minimum size is half the wavelength of light used by the microscope. Reducing the wavelength of that light means the microscope can see even smaller things, which results in increased resolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n                A diagram of the quantum microscopy by coincidence apparatus. Credit: Caltech\n             \n\n\nQuantum entanglement is not the only way to reduce the wavelength of light being used in a microscope. Green light has a shorter wavelength than red light, for example, and purple light has a shorter wavelength than green light. But due to another quirk of quantum physics, light with shorter wavelengths carries more energy. So, once you get down to light with a wavelength small enough to image tiny things, the light carries so much energy that it will damage the items being imaged, especially living things such as cells. This is why ultraviolet (UV) light, which has a very short wavelength, gives you a sunburn.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nQMC gets around this limit by using biphotons that carry the lower energy of longer-wavelength photons while having the shorter wavelength of higher-energy photons.\n\"Cells don't like UV light,\" Wang says. \"But if we can use 400-nanometer light to image the cell and achieve the effect of 200-nm light, which is UV, the cells will be happy, and we're getting the resolution of UV.\"\nTo achieve that, Wang's team built an optical apparatus that shines laser light into a special kind of crystal that converts some of the photons passing through it into biphotons. Even using this special crystal, the conversion is very rare and occurs in about one in a million photons. Using a series of mirrors, lenses, and prisms, each biphoton\u2014which actually consists of two discrete photons\u2014is split up and shuttled along two paths, so that one of the paired photons passes through the object being imaged and the other does not.\nThe photon passing through the object is called the signal photon, and the one that does not is called the idler photon. These photons then continue along through more optics until they reach a detector connected to a computer that builds an image of the cell based on the information carried by the signal photon. Amazingly, the paired photons remain entangled as a biphoton behaving at half the wavelength despite the presence of the object and their separate pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Images produced by standard microscopy and quantum microscopy. Credit: Caltech\n             \n\n\nWang's lab was not the first to work on this kind of biphoton imaging, but it was the first to create a viable system using the concept. \"We developed what we believe a rigorous theory as well as a faster and more accurate entanglement-measurement method. We reached microscopic resolution and imaged cells.\"\nWhile there is no theoretical limit to the number of photons that can be entangled with each other, each additional photon would further increase the momentum of the resulting multiphoton while further decreasing its wavelength.\nWang says future research could enable entanglement of even more photons, although he notes that each extra photon further reduces the probability of a successful entanglement, which, as mentioned above, is already as low as a one-in-a-million chance.\nThe paper describing the work, \"Quantum Microscopy of Cells at the Heisenberg Limit,\" appears in Nature Communications.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tZhe He et al, Quantum microscopy of cells at the Heisenberg limit, Nature Communications (2023).

   "text": "Working with a great deal of dexterity and concentration, Jingo Bozzini, an electronics engineer, solders the tiny legs of a chip onto the green circuit board. \"Soldering isn't my strong suit,\" he grins. He's much more interested in programming the circuit on the chip, which was also the focus of his final practical exam last year.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of his individual practical work (IPA)\u2014his final project\u2014he and Yves Acremann from the Solid State Physics Research Group developed a test signal generator that simulates experimental data. This little silver box may look unremarkable, but it is of invaluable help in designing a novel microscope that will enable researchers to observe individual electrons.\n'Taking photos' with X-ray flashes\nETH Zurich is one of a number of universities around the world that are involved in building this groundbreaking instrument. When completed, the k-microscope, as it is known, will be connected to the LCLS-II free-electron laser\u2014a particle accelerator at Stanford that moves electrons in a slalom course so that they emit powerful X-ray flashes.\nThese X-rays are then directed at a specimen in the microscope, causing electrons to detach from the specimen. A detector at the end of the microscope captures these electrons and calculates their exit angle and time of flight. This data tells researchers more about the electronic properties of a specimen, such as a new semiconductor. The super-fast flashes can also be used to observe dynamic processes such as a chemical reaction.\n\"The test signal generator simulates the electrons hitting the detector,\" explains Acremann, a physicist. \"It's connected to the detector electronics to program the software for the microscope. This step can be done from the comfort of an office.\" Bozzini's simulator enables researchers to develop the software while the microscope is still being built. This will save them a lot of time and money because the software will already be fully operational when the researchers connect the microscope to the particle accelerator.\nIntegrated into the research group\nApprentices also have to prepare a detailed schedule for their IPA. \"Testing the generator and documenting the work took longer than planned,\" Bozzini recounts. This was mainly because he had written his work\u2014as is common in research\u2014in English and using LaTeX, a software program. That's not the only thing that makes Bozzini's work unusual: \"This final project goes well beyond the basic skills of an electronics engineer,\" Acremann says. In January, Bozzini even managed to publish a scientific paper on the test signal generator in the Journal of Instrumentation\u2014not an everyday achievement for an apprentice.\nAs an apprentice, Bozzini was fully integrated into the research group. \"I was able to contribute to the group's output with my paper,\" he says. The close collaboration between researchers and apprentices is a hallmark of vocational training at ETH Zurich. The aspiring electronics engineers spend the first two years of their education in the electronics training lab, where they learn the basics of circuit technology, manufacturing and measuring technology, and programming. For the next two years, they do an apprenticeship within ETH\u2014in a research lab, for example. \"Especially in experimental physics, it's important that we have experts who can solve technical problems and implement things effectively,\" Acremann explains.\nAlthough Bozzini thinks it's cool that his thesis made an important contribution to basic research, he remains modest: \"That's my job\u2014it's what I get paid for,\" he says. He doesn't yet know whether he would one day like to work in research himself. He's currently completing a one-year full-time vocational diploma. He has fond memories of his successful apprenticeship at ETH Zurich: after his IPA, he got to travel with Acremann to Hamburg, where the microscope is currently being set up. \"That was an exciting experience for me. That's when I saw that my work can actually contribute to basic research,\" he says.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJ.

The lead author is doctoral student Alexander Jarjour.\nThe project was led by Katja Nowack, assistant professor of physics in the College of Arts and Sciences and the paper's senior author, whose lab investigates emergent phenomena and order in quantum materials via a range of scanning probes. The group's superconducting quantum interference device, or SQUID, is particularly adept at working at low temperatures and in small magnetic fields.\nThe researchers applied their SQUID\u2014one of only several in the U.S.\u2014to the inorganic compound molybdenum disulfide, which is known as a van der Waals material. While chemical bonds are generally considered to be the superglue of condensed matter physics, atoms can also be held together by the electric polarization of van der Waals forces, which are comparatively weaker but have their own unique perk. Van der Waals materials, such as graphene, can be exfoliated and their flakes assembled into atomically thin layers.\n\"The beauty of van der Waals materials is that there's a huge array of different types of physical systems, like superconductors and topological insulators, you can make in these really thin, micron-scale flakes,\" Jarjour said. \"The bad part is that people over the last decades have invented analysis tools to try to understand what's going on inside of bulk materials, meaning big chunks of stuff, and those tools, more or less without exception, don't work for van der Waals materials because they're too thin and they're too small.\"\nThe typical method to probe van der Waals superconductors is through measuring electrical transport, which can show a phase transition to zero resistance has occurred when the critical temperature is reached. But after that, according to Nowack, \"essentially, you turn blind,\" because the method doesn't provide any information about how many electrons are participating\u2014and in what way\u2014in the superconducting state.\nThe team improved upon that approach by spin coating their SQUID with a micron-thick layer of ionic liquid and positioning it as close as possible to the fragile sample without damaging it.\nThe SQUID revealed the material was expelling the device's magnetic field.\n\"Seeing magnetic field expulsion, in combination with very low resistance, is a really clear signature that something is a superconductor,\" Jarjour said. \"We've set a new milestone for someone who finds a new van der Waals superconductor and really wants to prove it's a superconductor.\"\nJust as importantly, the expulsion provided new information about the electrical transport in van der Waals materials.\n\"How well the superconductor expels magnetic field gives us information about how many electrons are participating,\" Jarjour said. \"We measured that for the first time in an atomically thin van der Waals superconductor, and we found actually there's a lot of electrons that are not participating in the superconducting state. We believe that we have a reasonable case, based on the data, that is because there's electronic disorder in these samples.\"\nThe findings also show how 2D superconductors differ from their bulkier 3D relatives. In some devices, the researchers observed signatures of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition, which is specific to 2D materials, whereas in others they found an expanded superfluid response.\n\"I'm excited that we can use this tool now and apply it to this large class of really fascinating superconductors, which are a rich playground in condensed matter physics for realizing extraordinary superconducting phenomena,\" Nowack said.\nCo-authors include doctoral student G.

The art-deco-esque device shown above is a combined trap for ions (charged atoms) and detector for individual photons (particles of light).

Quantum computers can assign values to those two quantum states, similar to the 0s and 1s in the binary system that our classical computers use to operate.\nThe best practice thus far has been to use a large, custom-built microscope lens and bulky single-photon detector to identify whether a trapped ion glows or not. That's sufficient on a small scale, but technical problems arise when a quantum computing system needs to keep track of many ions at once (for added processing power). Ions can be out of view, or the image can get distorted.\nNot only do NIST researchers have a potential alternative, but they've just made it much more realistic.\nOur combined ion trap/single-photon detector takes away the need for bulky equipment and maintains the potential for a clear view of all the ions in the system.\nPrevious iterations faced the challenge of competing personalities. The trap needed large voltages on its electrodes to hold ions in place, while the detector was much more delicate and preferred an environment without large electrical signals.\nNow, our team has crafted a version with an aluminum barrier around the bottom of the detector. The ion trap can use large voltages, and the detector can keep its peace.

   "text": "Whenever SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory's linear accelerator is on, packs of around a billion electrons each travel together at nearly the speed of light through metal piping. These electron bunches form the accelerator's particle beam, which is used to study the atomic behavior of molecules, novel materials and many other subjects.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut trying to estimate what a particle beam actually looks like as it travels through an accelerator is difficult, often leaving scientists with only a rough approximation of how a beam will behave during an experiment.\nNow, researchers at the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, the DOE's Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago have developed an algorithm that more precisely predicts a beam's distribution of particle positions and velocities as it zips through an accelerator.\nThis detailed beam information will help scientists perform their experiments more reliably\u2014a need that is becoming increasingly important as accelerator facilities operate at higher and higher energies and generate more complex beam profiles. The researchers detailed their algorithm and method in Physical Review Letters.\n\"We have a lot of different ways to manipulate particle beams inside of accelerators, but we don't have a really precise way to describe a beam's shape and momentum,\" SLAC accelerator scientist and lead author Ryan Roussel said. \"Our algorithm takes into account information about a beam that is normally discarded and uses that information to paint a more detailed picture of the beam.\"\nTypically, researchers describe the positions and speeds of particles in a beam in terms of a few summary statistics that provide a rough shape of the beam overall\u2014but that approach throws out a lot of potentially useful information. Alternatively, beam scientists can take many measurements of the beam itself and try to reconstruct, sometimes using machine learning, what the beam would look like under different experimental circumstances\u2014but those methods require a lot of data and a lot of computational power.\nFor this study, the team tried a new approach: They built a machine learning model that uses our understanding of beam dynamics to predict the distribution of particles positions and speeds within the beam, collectively known as the beam's phase space distribution.\nTo test their ideas, the team used their model to interpret experimental data from the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator at the DOE's Argonne National Laboratory. Including the physics of particle beam dynamics with the experimental data allowed the researchers to accurately reconstruct fine details of the beam using only 10 data points\u2014a task that might take up to 10,000 data points for some machine learning models that don't include a model of beam physics.\n\"Most machine learning models don't directly include any notion of particle beam dynamics to speed up learning and reduce the amount of data required,\" SLAC accelerator scientist and co-author Auralee Edelen said. \"We've shown that we can infer very complicated high-dimensional beam shapes from astonishingly small amounts of data.\"\nThe algorithm can currently reconstruct a model of a beam along its up-down and left-right axes, as if the particle bunch were a pancake moving down the accelerator path. This type of reconstruction is called 4D beam phase space. Next, researchers want to demonstrate the algorithm experimentally on reconstructing full 6D phase space distributions, which includes particle positions and speed along the direction in which the beam is traveling.\nOverall, the algorithm is a major paradigm shift in the way we analyze experimental accelerator data at facilities today, Roussel said.\n\"We can now use particle beam data in a more comprehensive, powerful way to improve our scientific goals at accelerators everywhere,\" he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tR.

   "text": "In 2010 Prof. Shlomo Havlin and collaborators published an article in the journal Nature proposing that the abrupt electricity failure causing the famous 2003 Italy blackout was a consequence of the inter-dependency of two networks. According to Havlin's theory the dependency between the power network and its communication system led to cascading failures and abrupt collapse. Havlin's seminal work ignited a new field in statistical physics known as \"network of networks\" or \"interdependent networks\" and paved the way for understanding and predicting the effects of the interaction between networks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main novelty of Havlin's model is the existence of two types of links that represent two qualitatively different kinds of interactions. Within networks, links between nodes describe connectivity such as electric power or communication connections. Between networks, on the other hand, links describe dependency relationships in which the functionality of a node in one network depends on the functionality of a node in the other. The communication hubs need electricity and the electric power stations depend on communication control. This dependency leads to a cascading effect in which failure of a single node in one of the networks could lead to an abrupt breakdown of both networks.\nOver the past decade or so since, Havlin, from the Department of Physics at Bar-Ilan University in Israel, and others have applied this concept to a variety of abstract systems, such as the internet, road traffic, the economy, infrastructure, and more. But being a theorist, Havlin was unable to manifest the hypothesis on real experimental physical systems and thus the theory couldn't be confirmed in controlled experiments, nor could it be implemented for device-type applications.\nRecently, Havlin joined forces with his colleague, Prof. Aviad Frydman, an experimentalist in the Physics department at Bar-Ilan who specializes in electrical properties of disordered systems, in particular superconductors. Superconductivity is a phenomenon observed in certain metals where electric resistance vanishes when the system is cooled down below a critical temperature.\nInspired by Havlin's theory, Frydman's group developed a controlled system of interdependent superconducting networks, a physical analogy to the interdependent networks involved in the Italy blackout. The two superconducting networks are separated by a layer which is an electric insulator but enables transfer of heat between the networks, thus creating a system of two types of interactions. Within each layer, the electric currents represent connectivity links while the heat flowing between networks represents dependency links since it can disrupt the superconductivity segments.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nHavlin's and Frydman's collaborative groups included lab manager Dr. Ira Volotsenko and three graduate students, Dr. Ivan Bonamassa, Bnaya Gross and Maayan Laav.\nThe research conducted by the two groups, published today, May 1, in the journal Nature Physics, shows that while separate, uncoupled networks exhibit a smooth, continuous transition between a superconductor and a normal metal as temperature is increased, coupled systems show an abrupt, discontinuous transition, as predicted by the theory. This is attributed to the fact that the current flowing in a normal segment of one layer causes a superposed segment in the other layer to become hotter, and hence, lose its superconductivity. This thermal feedback process between the layers continues in a self-propagating fashion (i.e., cascading back and forth between the layers) and eventually results in a spontaneous propagating avalanche of junctions entering the metallic phase.\nThe breakthrough study establishes the first physics laboratory benchmark for the manifestation of the theory of interdependent networks, enabling experimental studies to control and to further develop the multiscale phenomena of complex interdependent materials.\nThis research has vast significance in several disciplines, including basic physics, materials science and device applications. In basic physics, the scientific impact is in the discovery of new physics phenomena related to phase transitions. The results demonstrate that phase transitions governed by a single interaction type, extensively studied for over 100 years, are just a limiting case of a much richer, general phenomena governed by several types of interactions.\nThe results may also lead to the establishment of a new field of network metamaterials based on coupled layers with different inter-layer interactions exhibiting novel physics phenomena. The research also indicates that the abrupt breakdown of a network system may be a desirable phenomenon. If harnessed, it can be applied toward engineering self-healing systems or to devise high-sensitive switchers or sensors, for example, for single-photon detection.\nWhile network science originated from physics in 2000, its subsequent development and applications have surprisingly not benefitted physics, but almost all other scientific and technological fields.

The findings, published in Nature Communications earlier this month, look beyond the framework of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity to probe these mysterious particles, Chiu says.\nWeyl fermions were first discovered in 2015 by a group of physicists at Northeastern and Princeton universities. The discovery capped off an 85-year search for the massless particle, considered a basic building block of other subatomic particles, since its existence was first theorized by physicist Hermann Weyl in 1929.\nIn June of 2015, Bansil and the team of researchers predicted that a specific crystalline material, called Tantalum arsenide (TaAs), would host Weyl fermions. Soon after, the researchers demonstrated in an experimental paper the presence of the particles in TaAs through photoemission spectroscopy.\nThe discovery prompted a surge of experimental and theoretical explorations of Weyl fermions in different materials for want of a mechanical explanation of how they actually behave in real-time.\n\"Weyl fermions are relativistic particles that had actually never been seen, or observed, until 2015,\" Chiu says. \"Our main focus in this work is understanding how these kinds of quasiparticles are interacting, and what the mechanisms are behind these interactions.\"\nThe most significant part of the researchers' findings, he says, is that the new framework for these quantum-level interactions challenges the longstanding view of \"causality\" as existing in spacetime. In Einstein's theory of relativity, the traditional view of causality\u2014or mere cause-and-effect\u2014is that it is \"time-ordered,\" meaning it is established in relation to chronological time. Under this view, causality refers to the principle that an event can only be influenced by other events that occur within its past light cone, Chiu says.\n\"This means that if 'A' causes event 'B,' then event 'A' must occur before event 'B' in both space and time,\" he says. \"The light cone forms the event horizon or the boundary in spacetime which distinguishes between events that are and are not causally connected.\"\nIn other words, no object or signal can travel faster than the speed of light. This principle is sometimes referred to as the causality principle in relativity. The concept of causality in relativity is important, Chiu says, because it sets fundamental limits on what can be observed and measured in the universe.\nInstead of thinking about the behavior of Weyl fermions in terms of spacetime, Chiu and his associates say these causal interactions are better understood as a result of measurable changes in the \"energy-momentum\" space.\n\"Our study, for the first time, shows how key concepts of causality and the associated event horizon in spacetime can be carried over into the field of correlated Weyl materials, and thus unveils fundamental connections between condensed matter and high-energy physics,\" Chiu says.\nThe work, he says, \"opens up opportunities for exploring new connections between the world of particles and the larger world we experience every day.\"\n\"This study reveals for the first time how the ideas of causality that are enshrined in Einstein's theory of relativity\u2014and lead to the concepts of 'light cones' and 'event horizons' that have become the stuff of movies and common sci-fi works\u2014can be generalized and expanded into the world of quantum materials,\" Bansil says,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWei-Chi Chiu et al, Causal structure of interacting Weyl fermions in condensed matter systems, Nature Communications (2023).

   "text": "Inside the proton are elementary particles called quarks. Quarks and protons have an intrinsic angular momentum called spin. Spin can point in different directions. When it is perpendicular to the proton's momentum, it is called a transverse spin. Just like the proton carries an electric charge, it also has another fundamental charge called the tensor charge. The tensor charge is the net transverse spin of quarks in a proton with transverse spin.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only way to obtain the tensor charge from experimental data is using the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) to extract the \"transversity\" function. This universal function encodes the difference between the number of quarks with their spin aligned and anti-aligned to the proton's spin when it is in a transverse direction. Using state-of-the-art data science techniques, researchers recently made the most precise empirical determination of the tensor charge.\nDue to the phenomenon known as confinement, quarks are always bound in the proton or other hadrons (particles with multiple quarks). The challenge is to connect the theory of quark interactions (QCD) to experimental measurements of high-energy collisions involving hadrons.\nResearchers from the Coordinated Theoretical Approach to Transverse Momentum Dependent Hadron Structure in QCD Topical Collaboration (TMD Collaboration), working in conjunction with the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) Angular Momentum Collaboration (JAM Collaboration), analyzed data from a wide range of experiments where protons and/or quarks were transversely polarized. This allowed for the most precise empirical determination of the proton's tensor charge. The tensor charge is not only a fundamental property of the proton but also needed in searches for new physics.\nThe results were then compared to computations of the proton's tensor charge by lattice QCD, which simulates the proton's structure on a supercomputer. After about a decade of results showing disagreement between empirical methods and lattice QCD for the proton's tensor charge, researchers for the first time found agreement between the two. Their findings are published in the journal Physical Review D.\nThe empirical study was performed using QCD theory and state-of-the-art numerical methods. A crucial part of the analysis was the utilization of data from electron\u2013positron, electron\u2013proton, and proton\u2013proton scattering. This opens a new frontier in QCD global analyses to simultaneously include all possible measurements, like those from the future Electron-Ion Collider and Jefferson Lab 12 GeV, to continue to increase the precision and accuracy of extracting the proton's tensor charge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLeonard Gamberg et al, Updated QCD global analysis of single transverse-spin asymmetries: Extracting H\u02dc , and the role of the Soffer bound and lattice QCD, Physical Review D (2022).

   "text": "Magnesium diboride (MgB2) is a low-cost, non-toxic superconductor used in field magnets, electric motors, and generators. However, producing nanoscale boron (B) particles to fabricate MgB2 is expensive. Researchers recently tackled this issue by using high-energy ultra-sonication in 2-propanol, a highly viscous solvent, to produce impurity-free, nm-sized B particles. The approach is cost-effective and enables fabrication of bulk MgB2 with high critical current density, a prerequisite for the sustainable production of high-performance superconducting magnets.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagnesium diboride (MgB2), a binary compound, behaves as a superconductor\u2014a substance that offers no resistance to electric current flowing through it\u2014at a moderate temperature of around 39 K (-234\u00b0C). This temperature can be achieved using relatively inexpensive liquid hydrogen or neon coolants.\nIn addition, MgB2 is inexpensive, lightweight, and non-toxic, and its precursors\u2014magnesium (Mg) and boron (B)\u2014are abundantly available. As a result, it can replace conventional low-temperature superconductors that require expensive liquid helium for cooling and substitute magnets based on neodymium, a rare element, as well as iron and boron.\nMgB2 finds a wide range of applications, including the manufacture of coils and magnets for magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear magnetic resonance, magnetic drug delivery, fault current limiters, electric motors, and transportation. According to research, MgB2 is a good candidate for polycrystalline superconducting magnets as it exhibits good critical current density (Jc) and a high trapped magnetic field (TF).\nIt, however, suffers from weak magnetic flux pinning. To enhance pinning, it is essential to tune the pinning centers in MgB2\u2014the boundaries of grains or small crystals that constitute MgB2. To this end, researchers have now shown how nano-sized B particles can be used as B precursors to fabricate nano-sized MgB2 grains with strong grain boundary pinning and high Jc.\nCurrently, B nanoparticles are produced by ball milling, pyrolysis, and sintering. These techniques, however, suffer from drawbacks such as low purity output and poor cost-effectivity, necessitating better alternatives. To this end, a group of scientists led by Prof. Muralidhar Miryala from Shibaura Institute of Technology (SIT), Japan recently explored high-energy ultra-sonication as a cost-effective alternative for refining coarse B powder dispersed in 2-propanol up to nanoscale sizes. Their work was made available in the Journal of Alloys and Compounds.\n\"In this technique, ultrasonic vibrations impart high speeds to B particles in the solvent, leading to collisions. The resulting friction and shear tearing, compression, and energy release by the collapse of tiny air bubbles produced during collision break down B particles to nanometer sizes,\" explains Prof. Miryala.\nUsing 2-propanol as the solvent for B, the researchers ultrasonically refined cheap commercial B powder for 45 minutes to produce oxide-free nm-sized B particles. They then utilized them to fabricate bulk MgB2 with scarce oxide and no carbon impurities, which showed superconductivity at around 38.5 K.\nFurthermore, it showed high Jc values of 500 and 380 kA cm-2 at 10 K and 20 K, respectively. The latter of these Jcvalues marked an 80% improvement compared to that for bulk MgB2 prepared from cheap B powder and was at par with that for expensive commercial B powder. The observed increase in Jc was due to better grain boundary pinning in MgB2 as revealed by microstructural analysis, and theoretically supported by the Dew\u2013Hughes theory.\nFinally, the researchers performed field cooling magnetization simulations, predicting that a 40-mm wide and 10 mm-thick MgB2 disk prepared from ultrasonically refined B powder can exhibit a high TF of 2.5 teslas. \"These findings bring MgB2 superconducting magnets, which can be fabricated in the form of tapes, wires, and films, a step closer to their commercialization,\" says Prof. Miryala.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA.

On their own or in concert with traditional electronic circuits, these laser-powered devices send and process information at the speed of light, making them a promising solution for artificial intelligence's data-hungry applications.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to their incomparable speed, photonic circuits use significantly less energy than electronic ones. Electrons move relatively slowly through hardware, colliding with other particles and generating heat, while photons flow without losing energy, generating no heat at all. Unburdened by the energy loss inherent in electronics, integrated photonics are poised to play a leading role in sustainable computing.\nPhotonics and electronics draw on separate areas of science and use distinct architectural structures. Both, however, rely on lithography to define their circuit elements and connect them sequentially. While photonic chips don't make use of the transistors that populate electronic chips' ever-shrinking and increasingly layered grooves, their complex lithographic patterning guides laser beams through a coherent circuit to form a photonic network that can perform computational algorithms.\nBut now, for the first time, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science have created a photonic device that provides programmable on-chip information processing without lithography, offering the speed of photonics augmented by superior accuracy and flexibility for AI applications.\nAchieving unparalleled control of light, this device consists of spatially distributed optical gain and loss. Lasers cast light directly on a semiconductor wafer, without the need for defined lithographic pathways.\nLiang Feng, Professor in the Departments of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) and Electrical Systems and Engineering (ESE), along with Ph.D. student Tianwei Wu (MSE) and postdoctoral fellows Zihe Gao and Marco Menarini (ESE), introduced the microchip in a recent study published in Nature Photonics.\nSilicon-based electronic systems have transformed the computational landscape. But they have clear limitations: they are slow in processing signal, they work through data serially and not in parallel, and they can only be miniaturized to a certain extent. Photonics is one of the most promising alternatives because it can overcome all these shortcomings.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"But photonic chips intended for machine learning applications face the obstacles of an intricate fabrication process where lithographic patterning is fixed, limited in reprogrammability, subject to error or damage and expensive,\" says Feng. \"By removing the need for lithography, we are creating a new paradigm. Our chip overcomes those obstacles and offers improved accuracy and ultimate reconfigurability given the elimination of all kinds of constraints from predefined features.\"\nWithout lithography, these chips become adaptable data-processing powerhouses. Because patterns are not pre-defined and etched in, the device is intrinsically free of defects. Perhaps more impressively, the lack of lithography renders the microchip impressively reprogrammable, able to tailor its laser-cast patterns for optimal performance, be the task simple (few inputs, small datasets) or complex (many inputs, large datasets).\n\n\n\n\n\n                Lithography-free integrated photonic processor for on-chip signal processing and network training.

We can integrate it easily with classical electronics. And we can reprogram it, changing the laser patterns on the fly to achieve real-time reconfigurable computing for on-chip training of an AI network.\"\nAn unassuming slab of semiconductor, the device couldn't be simpler. It's the manipulation of this slab's material properties that is the key to research team's breakthrough in projecting lasers into dynamically programmable patterns to reconfigure the computing functions of the photonic information processor.\nThis ultimate reconfigurability is critical for real-time machine learning and AI.\n\"The interesting part,\" says Menarini, \"is how we are controlling the light. Conventional photonic chips are technologies based on passive material, meaning its material scatters light, bouncing it back and forth. Our material is active. The beam of pumping light modifies the material such that when the signal beam arrives, it can release energy and increase the amplitude of signals.\"\n\"This active nature is the key to this science, and the solution required to achieve our lithography-free technology,\" adds Gao. \"We can use it to reroute optical signals and program optical information processing on-chip.\"\nFeng compares the technology to an artistic tool, a pen for drawing pictures on a blank page.\n\"What we have achieved is exactly the same: pumping light is our pen to draw the photonic computational network (the picture) on a piece of unpatterned semiconductor wafer (the blank page).\"\nBut unlike indelible lines of ink, these beams of light can be drawn and redrawn, their patterns tracing innumerable paths to the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTianwei Wu et al, Lithography-free reconfigurable integrated photonic processor, Nature Photonics (2023).

   "text": "A team of scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy's Ames National Laboratory demonstrated a way to advance the role of quantum computing in materials research with an adaptive algorithm for simulating materials. Quantum computers have potential capabilities far beyond today's computers, and using an adaptive algorithm allows them to produce solutions quickly and accurately.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantum computers have a completely different way of computing than the computers we use today. They are built of quantum bits, or qubits, which can encode much more information than the bits in today's computers. These unique capabilities allow quantum computers to make calculations beyond what is currently possible with classical computers.\nA team of scientists at Ames Lab are working to harness the power of quantum computers to make materials research easier and more efficient. A primary research focus at Ames Lab is rare earth materials. These materials are used in a variety of technology, including smart phones, computer hard drives, light-emitting-diodes (LEDs), electronic displays, and permanent magnets for alternative energy technology, such as wind turbines.\nReliance on rare earth materials is challenging because they are expensive and limited in their geographic distribution. Scientists at Ames Lab are working to find alternative materials that can substitute for rare earths but are less expensive and more available. To accomplish this task, scientists need a better understanding of rare earths and their behavior in various materials and applications. Using quantum computers to aid in this research can potentially make the process more efficient and allow scientists to make advancements more quickly.\nYongxin Yao, a scientist at Ames Lab, explained that currently it is challenging to accurately simulate rare earth materials on a computer because of their complex electronic structure. The approach his team developed is based on impurity models, which describe magnetic impurities in materials. Additionally, these models take into account how the impurity interacts with the rest of the material and helps capture the electronic properties. Their approach also uses quantum embedding methods to simulate the bulk materials.\nIn this case, quantum embedding refers to a lower dimensional representation of the material. The scientists adopted a systematic way to simplify how the bulk material is represented to make these simulations possible. Using quantum embedding reduces computational resources, while maintaining accuracy.\n\"In order to reduce the error in our calculations, we need compact quantum circuits,\" Yao explained. \"A variety of paths, specifically quantum circuits composed of a set of hardware operations, can move the system from an initial point to the final point you want to reach. Because of the error associated with each operation, you want the shortest path.\"\nThe algorithm Yao's team used is designed to automatically find shortest paths to reach the targeted state. He said that this work is an important step towards being able to simulate the whole systems of real materials. When this technology is fully developed, it can help material researchers discover and design new materials for specific purposes more efficiently.\n\"We have developed some adaptive way to construct compact quantum circuits for either static or dynamic simulations. This work is a first comprehensive application of the adaptive method for impurity models derived from real materials,\" said Yao. \"So that's an important step toward real materials simulations on quantum computers.\"\nThis research is further discussed in the paper, \"Comparative study of adaptive variational quantum eigensolvers for multi-orbital impurity models.\" The paper is published in the journal Communications Physics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnirban Mukherjee et al, Comparative study of adaptive variational quantum eigensolvers for multi-orbital impurity models, Communications Physics (2023).

Most such materials are made using titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles, which are toxic to humans. So scientists have been looking for an organic source. To that end, they have been looking at animals that have natural white coatings made of thin material. In this new effort, the team focused their energy on learning more about the bright white stripes on Pacific cleaner shrimp.\nTo learn more about the stripes, the team obtained samples and studied them using microscopy. Then, using optical measurements, they created simulations showing how the stripes interact with light. They found that the stripes are white due to a thin white coating. They also found that the coating was made of extremely thin layers of nanospheres packed tightly together. In watching as light was introduced, the researchers could see it scatter due to the angles created by the nanospheres.\nThey found that this optical crowding resulted in the stripes reflecting up to 80% of the light that struck them. The researchers determined that the nanospheres were made up of spoke-like isoxanthopterin molecules. These molecules, they found, allowed for efficient scattering even as the nanospheres were densely packed.\nThe study illuminates the role of optical anisotropy as it applies to light-scattering.

   "text": "Topological superconductors are superconducting materials with unique characteristics, including the appearance of so-called in-gap Majorana states.

Most of these efforts suggested sandwiching quantum skyrmion crystals between superconductors to achieve topological superconductivity.\nKristian M\u00e6land and Asle Sudb\u00f8, two researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, have recently proposed an alternative model system of topological superconductivity, which does not contain superconducting materials. This theoretical model, introduced in Physical Review Letters, would instead use a sandwich structure of a heavy metal, a magnetic insulator, and a normal metal, where the heavy metal induces a quantum skyrmion crystal in the magnetic insulator.\n\"We have been interested in low-dimensional novel types of quantum spin systems for a long time and were looking into the question of how quantum spin-fluctuations in quantum skyrmion crystals could affect normal metallic states and possibly lead to superconductivity of an unusual type,\" Sudb\u00f8 told Phys.org.\n\"Previous work that in particular have inspired us and that we have been building on, is the experimental work of Heinze et al on realizations of quantum skyrmion crystals, and two of our own papers on quantum skyrmion crystals.\"\nIn a paper published in 2011, Stefan Heinze at University of Kiel and his colleagues at University of Hamburg showed that skyrmion crystals could be realized in actual physical systems. Inspired by the previous work by this research team, Sudb\u00f8 and M\u00e6land made a series of predictions, which serve as the basis of their newly proposed model system of topological superconductivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Illustrations of the skyrmion crystal ground states in the magnetic monolayer.

Previous propositions for creating topological superconductivity suggested sandwiching skyrmion crystals with superconductors. Our approach obviates the need for a superconductor in the sandwich.\"\nWhile they did not experimentally realize their proposed model system, Sudb\u00f8 and M\u00e6land tried to determine its properties through a series of calculations. Specifically, they calculated a property of the system's induced superconducting state, the so-called superconducting order parameter, and found that it had a non-trivial topology.\n\"We were able to create a model system where we can produce topological superconductivity in a heterostructure without having a superconductor a priori in the sandwich,\" Sudb\u00f8 said. \"Our system is sandwich structure of a normal metal and a magnetic insulator, while previous proposals have involved a sandwich structure of magnetic insulators and other superconductors.\"\nIn the future, new studies could try to realize the model system proposed by these researchers in an experimental setting, further examining its properties and potential for quantum computing applications. Meanwhile, Sudb\u00f8 and M\u00e6land plan to theoretically explore other possible routes to achieving unconventional superconductivity.\n\"In general terms, we will pursue unconventional superconductivity and routes to topological superconductivity in heterostructures of involving magnetic insulators with unusual and unconventional ground states as well as novel types of spin-excitations out of the ground state,\" Sudb\u00f8 said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKristian M\u00e6land et al, Topological Superconductivity Mediated by Skyrmionic Magnons, Physical Review Letters (2023).

   "text": "Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a hybrid imaging technique that combines optical illumination with ultrasound detection for high-resolution imaging of deep tissues. Utilizing the photoacoustic (PA) effect, PAT provides a distinct advantage with scalable resolution, higher imaging depth, and high contrast imaging. It uses nanosecond laser pulses to illuminate the tissue of interest, enabling their chromophores to absorb the incident laser energy. This results in a local temperature rise and generates pressure waves that propagate to the tissue boundary as ultrasound waves. These PA waves are then acquired with the help of an ultrasound transducer and converted into internal absorption maps using reconstruction algorithms.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis process of generating initial pressure maps can be carried out with several different image reconstruction algorithms, including the simple delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer. This algorithm back-projects the acquired signals from various tissue locations, which are then added at every pixel in the reconstructed image. However, this makes the DAS beamformer computationally expensive and time-consuming, and results in artifacts, i.e., anomalies, in the reconstructed images. Despite these drawbacks, its simplicity and ease of implementation make it a popular choice for PAT reconstruction.\nTypically, implementing such reconstruction algorithms requires a workstation, desktop, or laptop with extensive computational resources. But the computational power of mobile phones has been growing in recent years. Although mobile phones have been proposed for various microscopy modalities including ultrasound imaging, their utility for photoacoustic imaging such as PAT image reconstruction has not been explored.\nCapitalizing on the advanced processing ability of mobile phones, researchers from Singapore and the United States have now developed an Android-based application for PAT image reconstruction. The study was led by Manojit Pramanik, Northrop Grumman Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Iowa State University, and published in the Journal of Biomedical Optics (JBO).\nThe developed application utilizes a single-element ultrasound transducer (SUT)-based DAS beamformer algorithm for image reconstruction on Kivy\u2014a cross-platform Python 3.9.5 framework.\nThe researchers verified its performance on different mobile phones by using simulated and experimental PAT datasets. While the simulated datasets consisted of point targets, triangular shape, and rat's brain vessel shape, experimental datasets comprised of a point source phantom, a triangular shape phantom and blood vessels in the brain of live rats.\n\"The developed application can successfully reconstruct the PAT data into high-quality PAT images with signal-to-noise ratio values above 30 decibels,\" comments Pramanik.\nInterestingly, the algorithm's computational time on a Huawei P20 mobile phone was comparable to that on a laptop for small datasets. Furthermore, two-fold downsampling of the original dataset reduced the computational time while maintaining the image quality, thus allowing image reconstruction with both speed and quality. In contrast, three-fold downsampling visibly degraded the PAT images.\nMoreover, the researchers found that with the Samsung Galaxy S21+'s advanced processor, PAT reconstruction could be achieved in only 2.4 seconds. \"This is a considerably reduced running time for image reconstruction and highlights the efficiency of the mobile phone application,\" notes Pramanik.\nJBO Editor-in-Chief Brian Pogue, Chair of Medical Physics at University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, remarks, \"This first-of-its-kind application provides an opportunity for PAT image reconstruction on inexpensive, portable, and widely available mobile phones. Going ahead, the application can make PAT systems more adaptable and extendable to other fields of biomedical imaging, facilitating point-of-care diagnosis.\" He adds, \"The code for this Android-based application has been made freely available on GitHub, making this a major service to the biomedical imaging community.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tXie Hui et al, Android mobile-platform-based image reconstruction for photoacoustic tomography, Journal of Biomedical Optics (2023).

The work, led by Zheting Jin (a graduate student in Yale Applied Physics) and his thesis supervisor, Sohrab Ismail-Beigi, is published in Physical Review B.\nDeveloping methods to accurately describe interacting quantum electrons has long been of interest to researchers in the fields because it can provide valuable insights about many important aspects of materials. Describing the electrons at this level is tricky for a few reasons, though. One is that, because they're quantum mechanical, they move in a wavy manner and tracking them is more complicated. The other is that they interact with each other.\nEach component of this problem is \"OK to deal with separately,\" said Ismail-Beigi, Strathcona Professor of Applied Physics, Physics, and Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science. But when you have waviness and interactions, the problem is so complex that nobody knows how to solve it efficiently.\nLike many difficult problems in physics and mathematics, one can in principle take a giant computer and numerically solve the problem with brute force, but the amount of computation and storage needed would be exponential in the number of electrons. For example, every time one adds a new electron to the system, the size of the computer needed increases by a factor of two (typically, even a larger factor). This means studying a system with about 50 electrons is infeasible even with today's largest supercomputers. For context, a single iodine atom has 53 electrons, while a small nanoparticle has more than 1,000 electrons.\n\"On the one hand, the electrons want to move around\u2014that's to take advantage of the kinetic energy,\" Ismail-Beigi said. \"On the other, they repel each other\u2014'don't come next to me if I'm here already.' Both effects are captured in the well-known Hubbard model for interacting electrons. Basically, it has these two key ingredients, and it's a very hard problem to solve. No one knows how to solve it exactly, and high-quality approximate and efficient solutions are not easy to come by.\"\nThe Ismail-Beigi team has developed a method related to a class of approaches that use what's known as an auxiliary or subsidiary boson. Typically, these approaches require much less computational resources but are only moderately accurate as they treat one atom at a time. Ismail-Beigi's team tried a different tack. Rather than examining one atom at a time, the researchers treat two or three bonded atoms at a time (called a cluster).\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Electrons can hop between the atoms in the cluster: we solve the cluster problem directly, and then we connect the clusters together in a novel way to describe the entire system,\" Ismail-Beigi said. \"In principle, the larger the cluster, the more accurate the approach, so the question is how large a cluster does one need to get a desired accuracy?\"\nResearchers have previously tried cluster approaches, but the computational costs have been prohibitively high and the accuracy has been wanting, given the added computational cost.\n\"Zheting and I found a clever way of matching different clusters together so that the quantities calculated between the different clusters agree across their boundaries,\" he said. \"The good news is that this method then gives a very highly accurate description with even a relatively small cluster of three atoms.

   "text": "A team of metallurgists and materials scientists at the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Eisenforschung GmbH has uncovered the reason for the sluggishness that occurs when attempting to use hydrogen instead of coke to make steel. In their study, reported in the journal Physical Review Letters, the group isolated the problem and offer solutions for producing steel with reduced carbon emissions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior research has shown that making steel accounts for approximately 7% to 9% of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, which has led scientists to look for cleaner ways of making the material. Thus far, the prime approach has been using hydrogen to heat the iron oxide. But this has proven to be too sluggish. In this new effort, the research team has found the reason for the sluggishness and has also found a solution.\nTo make steel, coke (which has a high carbon content) is burned inside of a blast furnace to heat up a quantity of iron oxide. As this happens, a reaction occurs between the carbon and the oxygen in the iron, resulting in the release of carbon dioxide into the air as the iron is converted to steel. Prior research has shown that as the oxygen leaves the iron during the reaction, pores remain in the iron which must then be cleared of oxygen by heating the metal a second time. In this new effort, the researchers found that these pores led to problems when attempting to use the much cleaner hydrogen to heat the iron oxide.\nBy using an electron microscope, the research team was able to see that when hydrogen was used to heat iron oxide, the pores that were left behind in the reactions became filled with water, which subsequently became trapped inside the iron. That water then reoxidized the iron, which was slowing the oxygen removal process. They also found that sometimes, channels formed that allowed the water to drain. Thus, the solution to removing the sluggishness from the process was to heat the iron oxide in a way that promoted the creation of channels, which could be done by introducing a microfracture structure into the feedstock.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tXuyang Zhou et al, Effect of Pore Formation on Redox-Driven Phase Transformation, Physical Review Letters (2023).

Although the laser's light will bounce off the atoms up to a point, as the frequency of the light is adjusted, a transparency window appears in which the light simply passes through the cavity unimpeded.\n\"We never knew this transparency window existed,\" says Caltech's Andrei Faraon (BS '04), William L. Valentine Professor of Applied Physics and Electrical Engineering, and co-corresponding author of a paper on the discovery that was published on April 26 in the journal Nature. \"Our research has primarily become a journey to find out why.\"\nAn analysis of the transparency window points to it being the result of interactions in the cavity between groups of atoms and light. This phenomenon is akin to destructive interference, in which waves from two or more sources can cancel one another out. The groups of atoms continually absorb and re-emit light, which generally results in the reflection of the laser's light. However, at the CIT frequency, there is a balance created by the re-emitted light from each of the atoms in a group, resulting in a drop in reflection.\n\"An ensemble of atoms strongly coupled to the same optical field can lead to unexpected results,\" says co-lead author Mi Lei, a graduate student at Caltech.\nThe optical resonator, which measures just 20 microns in length and includes features smaller than 1 micron, was fabricated at the Kavli Nanoscience Institute at Caltech.\n\"Through conventional quantum optics measurement techniques, we found that our system had reached an unexplored regime, revealing new physics,\" says graduate student Rikuto Fukumori, co-lead author of the paper.\nBesides the transparency phenomenon, the researchers also observed that the collection of atoms can absorb and emit light from the laser either much faster or much slower compared to a single atom depending on the intensity of the laser. These processes, called superradiance and subradiance, and their underlying physics are still poorly understood because of the large number of interacting quantum particles.\n\"We were able to monitor and control quantum mechanical light\u2013matter interactions at nanoscale,\" says co-corresponding author Joonhee Choi, a former postdoctoral scholar at Caltech who is now an assistant professor at Stanford University.\nThough the research is primarily fundamental and expands our understanding of the mysterious world of quantum effects, this discovery has the potential to one day help pave the way to more efficient quantum memories in which information is stored in an ensemble of strongly coupled atoms. Faraon has also worked on creating quantum storage by manipulating the interactions of multiple vanadium atoms.\n\"Besides memories, these experimental systems provide important insight about developing future connections between quantum computers,\" says Manuel Endres, professor of physics and Rosenberg Scholar, who is a co-author of the study.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMi Lei et al, Many-body cavity quantum electrodynamics with driven inhomogeneous emitters, Nature (2023).

The feat is a major step forward in capability for quantum computing development efforts. It also may enable quantum generation of truly random numbers, a long-sought goal for developing unbreakable encryption techniques for applications in\u2014for instance\u2014military communications and financial transactions. The detector was recently reported in Nature Photonics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysicists around the world are hotly pursuing the promise of reliable and robust quantum computing. Not only would harnessing quantum computing herald a giant leap for science, but it would also elevate the economy and enhance national security. But getting there has so far eluded the best brains on the planet.\nA pair of engineers at the U.S. Department of Energy's Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility has designed a crucial piece of a photon detection system that has brought physicists a step closer to fully operational photonics-based quantum computing\u2014that is, a quantum computer built entirely with light. The engineers are part of an interdisciplinary team of federal and academic researchers led by Jefferson Lab who are working on advancing quantum computing in nuclear physics.\nThere are many different ways to try to make a fully functioning quantum computer. For photonics-based computing, quantum detection of light particles, or photons, is vital. Currently, individual detectors can resolve up to about 10 photons, but that number is too small for many quantum-state generation methods. No one had yet demonstrated detection of more than 16 photons, but simulations suggest that quantum computing will require detecting large numbers of photons\u201450 or more.\nCrossing that 50-photon threshold means being able to implement a \"cubic gate\"\u2014a milestone toward building a complete gate set for universal quantum computing, explained Amr Hossameldin, team member and graduate research assistant in quantum computing and quantum optics at the University of Virginia.\nThe team blew past the record of 16 photons and demonstrated a photon count of about 35 per single detector and reached 100 photons with a three-detector system.\n\"They could predict that they were resolving 100 of these photons that were impacting upon the detectors with this extremely accurate resolution,\" said Robert Edwards, senior staff scientist and deputy associate director for theoretical and computational physics at Jefferson Lab. \"It's super accurate\u2014and that has never been achieved.\"\n\"The lack of detection has been a major limitation to this approach of quantum computing. The new photon number resolution is the necessary step to implementing a universal instruction set,\" he continued.\nThe new detection system also has another highly valuable secondary benefit: quantum generation of truly random numbers\u2014a boon to unbreakable secret codes or encryptions in such areas as military communications and financial transactions.\nSo-called random numbers generated by classical computer algorithms aren't truly random. The algorithm they are generated from can be compromised with some effort by playing a numbers game\u2014looking for which numbers pop up more often than others. True random-number generation using quantum physics has no such flaw or bias.\n\"There is an intrinsic randomness in quantum mechanics, where you can have a physical system that's in two states at once,\" explained Olivier Pfister, a physics professor at UVa who specializes in quantum fields and quantum information and served as external team leader for the project. \"And when you want to know which it is, it's random.\n\"Einstein got bugged by this. He called it 'the Old One playing dice with the universe.' And we don't know any better than Einstein.\"\nPfister and Hossameldin are co-authors of the paper presenting the team's research. Other authors are Chris Cuevas and Hai Dong from Jefferson Lab, Richard Birrittella and Paul Alsing from the Air Force Research Laboratory in New York, Miller Eaton from UVa, and Christopher C. Gerry from the City University of New York.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nSignals not seen before\nThe team effort was inspired by an announcement in 2019 by the DOE Office of Science offering funding opportunities for quantum information science research for nuclear physics under the Quantum Horizons program. Edwards secured a small grant to fund a lecture series bringing in experts in quantum computing.\nPfister was the first lecturer in March 2020. A week later, the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the lab, but the seed for joint research into photonics-based quantum computing had been planted.\nA large team of physicists, engineers and postdocs was assembled. The collaboration began with the goal to use quantum photonics for calculations relevant to the Jefferson Lab science program.\nUVa already had a photon-based system for making quantum calculations using a pulsed laser, but lacked the means to detect with great speed and accuracy the number of photons impacting on its detector before the signal decayed.\nMeanwhile, detecting particles with speed and accuracy is Jefferson Lab's forte. Its Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility, or CEBAF, has been used for decades in experiments that rely on ultra-sensitive detectors to measure the cascade of fleeting subatomic particles created when a particle beam slams into targets at nearly the speed of light. CEBAF is a DOE Office of Science user facility that is accessed by more than 1,850 nuclear physicists for their research.\nIn a team experiment at Pfister's Quantum Optics Lab at UVa, Hossameldin linked up three superconducting transition-edge sensor (TES) devices to make one detector, with each TES device capable of seeing 35 photons, and set them in front of the laser and turned on the beam.\nA high-speed digitizer designed and developed by Dong at Jefferson Lab was a key piece of the detector electronics.\n\"The TES original digitizers did not have the high-speed capabilities that are included with our design,\" said Cuevas. \"Our digitizer has a 12-bit accuracy with a 4ns sampling time, so this allowed us to capture signals from the TES that were not seen before.\"\nResearch for quantum computing is evolving at an exponential pace, and Cuevas predicts new technology will replace their system soon. But the larger collaboration to build a light-based quantum computer continues.\n\"The project is a very good example where designs can be reused and applied to a completely different scientific application,\" Cuevas said. \"Sharing technology is a core foundation for the scientific communities, and as electronics engineers, it is exciting to know our designs can further important discoveries.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMiller Eaton et al, Resolution of 100 photons and quantum generation of unbiased random numbers, Nature Photonics (2022).

   "text": "The glowing dots in these images are single rubidium atoms, pristinely arranged in arrays about as wide as a human hair. The team of CQT Principal Investigator Loh Huanqian captured these pictures to show how they can assemble atoms into any pattern\u2014even Singapore's Lion Head symbol\u2014fitting within a 15 by 15 triangular grid. The researchers describe the setup and novel algorithm that makes this possible in a paper published 15 March 2023 in Physical Review Applied.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers are keen to work with arrays of neutral atoms because, like Lego blocks that can be assembled into prototype buildings, atom arrays can be used to perform powerful quantum simulations of materials. Already scientists use supercomputers to calculate material properties, but the calculations quickly become intractable if you try to simulate more particles. With an atom array, scientists can model materials directly.\nThe CQT group's approach allowed them to achieve a state-of-the-art defect-free array size of 225 atoms reliably at room temperature. Perfection in the pattern is important because defects, or missing atoms, in an array have been found to deteriorate the observed signal in quantum simulations.\nRearranging atoms in parallel\nTo assemble their atom arrays, the group starts by trapping atoms using laser beams also known as optical tweezers. Trapping single atoms involves an element of chance, so not every tweezer is successfully loaded with an atom. This means that even though the researchers begin with an array of 400 tweezers, they end up with an atom array full of defects. In the next step, they rearrange the atoms in real time to form a smaller, defect-free target array.\nThis is where the team's approach diverges from existing approaches. Previous efforts to rearrange atoms have focused on moving the atoms one at a time using a single extra optical tweezer, after calculating the smallest number of moves needed. Atoms do not stay in their traps forever, so minimizing the number of moves, and so the time needed for the rearrangement, increases the probability of achieving a defect-free array.\nHuanqian and her group members have developed a system that instead speeds up the rearrangement by moving many atoms in parallel with multiple tweezers. In their experiment, up to 15 mobile tweezers can be used to move atoms simultaneously to generate the defect-free array. The maximum number of mobile tweezers involved can be specified by the user.\n\"Moving the atoms one at a time is like playing the piano with one finger,\" says Weikun, who is the first author of the paper. \"In our protocol, we use more fingers and can play the piano faster, which saves a lot of time. For example, if we had 100 atoms to move, instead of making 100 moves one at a time, we could move ten atoms at a time. This means that the number of moves we make is ten times smaller.\"\nTo make this work, the researchers designed a novel algorithm that calculates what moves to make.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nStrategic moves\nThe algorithm's input comes from an image of how the atoms are initially loaded. The image is converted to a binary matrix, with values 1 and 0 representing if an atom is successfully trapped in the tweezers or not. The researchers also specify the target array.\nThe rearrangement strategy consists of two parts. The first is row sorting. In this procedure, atoms in the rows are redistributed among the columns such that each column has the number of atoms required in the target array. The second is a column compression procedure that moves the atoms to their target positions.\nTo ensure atoms do not collide during moves, which could knock them out of the array, the group specified that the algorithm should always move atoms with the same speed and preserve their order.\nAfter completing the calculation, the algorithm communicates with the hardware. Optical tweezers, acting as mechanical arms, rearrange the atoms row by row, then column by column. The group call their algorithm the parallel sort-and-compression algorithm, which can complete the array assembly faster than a blink of an eye.\n\"Coding is one of the most difficult parts of the experiment,\" says Weikun. \"Our algorithm sees the whole picture, designs the entire move set in one go, makes sure that there is no collision and then conducts it.\"\nWith their novel algorithm, the group experimentally realized the defect-free 225-atom array with a success probability of 33%, which is among the highest success probabilities reported in the literature for room temperature setups. The team expects their success probability can be improved with quieter and more powerful laser sources.\n\"We have demonstrated that we can apply our algorithm to arbitrary geometries such as the honeycomb, kagome, and link-kagome, which are interesting for studying different advanced materials like graphene, superconductors or quantum spin liquids,\" says Huanqian. \"Just to show that we've done this in Singapore, we also rearranged the single atoms to form the Lion Head symbol.\" The Lion Head symbol was introduced as a national symbol in 1986 and symbolizes courage, strength and excellence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWeikun Tian et al, Parallel Assembly of Arbitrary Defect-Free Atom Arrays with a Multitweezer Algorithm, Physical Review Applied (2023).

   "text": "Miniaturized and multicolored light-emitting device arrays provide a promising instrument to sense, image and compute in materials science and applied physics. A range of emission colors can be achieved by using conventional light emitting diodes, although the process can be limited by material or device constraints.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a new report published in Science Advances, Vivian Wang and a research team in electrical engineering and materials science at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the University of California, Berkeley, developed a variety of highly multicolored light emitting arrays with diverse colors on a single chip. The array contained pulse-driven metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors to generate electroluminescence from micro-dispersed materials that spanned a variety of colors and spectral shapes.\nThe materials scientists and engineers combined compressive reconstruction algorithms to perform spectroscopic measurements in a compact environment, using multiplexed electroluminescent arrays to demonstrate spectral imaging of samples in conjunction with a camera.\nExperimental design\nMulticolored light emitting arrays have versatile applications in the field, although the range of colors in use are insufficient for commercial use. In this study, Wang and colleagues addressed the problem by using arrays of electroluminescent, alternating current-driven metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors, where they lithographically defined the device electrodes prior to depositing the emitting materials. The deposition of the emissive layer formed the final fabrication step in these devices, and the team used microprinting methods to dispense diverse color emitters on a single chip with ease to perform active spectral measurements in a miniaturized environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Design of arbitrary EL spectra.

DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adg1607\n             \n\n\nElectroluminescent device arrays with arbitrary spectra\nThe research team developed multiplexed arrays of light sources via metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor devices where they deposited emissive materials on top of capacitors engineered on silicon substrates. They applied an alternating current voltage between the two capacitors to overcome differences in band alignment at the metal-semiconductor contact to produce transient electroluminescence during each voltage transition. The materials scientists developed the transient electroluminescence from materials sensitive to the visible to infrared range with variations to both frequency and voltage.\nDuring the experiments, they characterized the brightness, efficiency color and spectral bandwidth of the electroluminescent devices. Due to its simplicity, the team successfully constructed large multicolor electroluminescent arrays on a single substrate. The team accomplished this by developing a 7 x 7 array of light emitting devices, where they deposited a different emissive layer on each pixel via micro-dispersing to obtain a nanometer-thin film. The team highlighted the core characteristics of the device by demonstrating how any light spectra could be generated with a sufficiently large library of emitters. For instance, the total light spectrum from a miniature electroluminescence array facilitated a linear combination of the spectra from individual elements. As a result, the researchers designed an array of emitters to yield a desired light spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Spectral measurement with highly multicolored arrays.

DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adg1607\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReconstructive spectral measurement and imaging \nThe team showed the scalability and versatility of the device platform alongside the breadth of achievable electroluminescence spectra with active spectral measurements. For example, they measured the transmission spectrum of an unknown sample by passing a broadband light through the sample. In another instance, they measured the spectral information with reconstructive spectrometry to recover spectral information algorithmically. The unique and inherently pulsed nature of the instrument allowed them to conduct alternate spectral measurements and achieve fast spectral measurements without switching devices.\nAfter conducting reconstructive spectral measurements, Wang et al. used the instrument for spectral imaging. In this instance, the electroluminescence arrays served as the light source, while a silicon charge-coupled camera captured images of the samples. They further accomplished spectral imaging of semi-transparent biological samples and maintained the scale of miniaturized light emitting arrays at the nanoscale/microscale on a chip since they can be feasible for a range of adaptive sensing applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Spectral imaging with highly multicolored arrays.

DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adg1607\n             \n\n\nOutlook\nIn this way, Vivian Wang and colleagues developed a simple and scalable instrument to house light-emitting device arrays with highly multiplexed emission spanning the visible and infrared wavelengths. The scientists used pulsed-driven metal-oxide semiconductor capacitors to completely integrate the multicolor devices.\nThis platform is a source of variable light emission via random selection to probe the spectral properties of samples and explore spectral reflectance and transmission imaging. The scientists improved spectral imaging accuracy and coverage with spectrally tuned materials such as colloidal quantum dots and perovskite nanomaterials, or thin luminescent films developed by combinatorial deposition.\nThis work can be expanded to more extreme wavelengths in addition to the visible spectrum. The pixels in the light emitting arrays can be individually addressed, allowing materials scientists to use the instruments and generate light with customizable patterns in frequency, space and time for multidimensional spectral measurements.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVivian Wang et al, Highly multicolored light-emitting arrays for compressive spectroscopy, Science Advances (2023).

Physicists from Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), the University of Rostock and the University of Konstanz have shown that this is the case.

This observation was already made in the first half of the 19th century by Alexandre Edmond Becquerel and later confirmed in various experiments, among others by Heinrich Hertz and Wilhelm Hallwachs. Since the photoelectric effect could not be reconciled with the light wave theory, Albert Einstein came to the conclusion that light must consist not only of waves, but also of particles. He laid the foundation for quantum mechanics.\nStrong laser light allows electrons to tunnel\nWith the development of laser technology, research into the photoelectric effect has gained a new impetus. \"Today, we can produce extremely strong and ultrashort laser pulses in a wide variety of spectral colors,\" explains Prof. Dr. Peter Hommelhoff, Chair for Laser Physics at the Department of Physics at FAU. \"This inspired us to capture and control the duration and intensity of the electron release of metals with greater accuracy.\"\nSo far, scientists have only been able to determine laser-induced electron dynamics precisely in gases\u2014with an accuracy of a few attoseconds. Quantum dynamics and emission time windows have not yet been measured on solids.\nThis is exactly what the researchers at FAU, the University of Rostock and the University of Konstanz have now succeeded in doing for the first time. They used a special strategy for this: Instead of just a strong laser pulse, which emits the electrons a pointy tungsten tip, they also used a second weaker laser with twice the frequency.\n\"In principle, you have to know that with very strong laser light, the individual photons are no longer responsible for the release of the electrons, but rather the electric field of the laser,\" explains Dr. Philip Dienstbier, a research associate at Peter Hommelhoff's chair and leading author of the study. \"The electrons then tunnel through the metal interface into the vacuum.\" By deliberately superimposing the two light waves, physicists can control the shape and strength of the laser field\u2014and thus also the emission of the electrons.\nCircuits a million times faster\nIn the experiment, the researchers were able to determine the duration of the electron flow to 30 attoseconds\u2014thirty billionths of a billionth of a second. This ultra-precise limitation of the emission time window could advance basic and application-related research in equal measure.\n\"The phase shift of the two laser pulses allows us to gain deeper insights into the tunnel process and the subsequent movement of the electron in the laser field,\" says Philip Dienstbier. \"This enables new quantum mechanical insights into both the emission from the solid state body and the light fields used.\"\nThe most important field of application is light-field-driven electronics: With the proposed two-color method, the laser light can be modulated in such a way that an exactly defined sequence of electron pulses and thus of electrical signals could be generated.\nDienstbier says, \"In the foreseeable future, it will be possible to integrate the components of our test setup\u2014light sources, metal tip, electron detector\u2014into a microchip.\" Complex circuits with bandwidths up to the petahertz range are then conceivable\u2014that would be almost a million times faster than current electronics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTunneling electrons, Nature (2023).

   "text": "Quasicrystals (QCs) have peculiar structures with interesting atomic arrangements. Although they are similar to crystals from the exterior, at the atomic scale, they lack periodicity despite being ordered. Such structural arrangements confer quasicrystals with symmetries and other special properties that are missing in crystals. In particular, icosahedral QCs (i QCs), which have a special geometric structure, show interesting magnetic properties.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a recent breakthrough, a research team led by Professor Ryuji Tamura from the Tokyo University of Science (TUS) discovered ferromagnetic order in gold\u2013gallium\u2013gadolinium and gold\u2013gallium\u2013terbium i QCs. However, these i QCs have not been suitable for the further study of ferromagnetism in i QCs because they have also contained a large fraction of the approximant crystal (AC) phase.\nACs have a similar structure to QCs, but as they are also magnetic, this interferes with studies on the magnetism of the QC phase alone.\nTo bridge this gap, Professor Tamura's team has now synthesized a novel gold\u2013gallium\u2013dysprosium (Au\u2013Ga\u2013Dy) i QC. According to Professor Tamura, \"The Au\u2013Ga\u2013Dy i QC is ferromagnetic, highly tunable, and has high phase purity.\"\nThe research team, which included Mr. Ryo Takeuchi and Dr. Farid Labib from TUS, has published their findings in Physical Review Letters. This paper has been selected as Editors' Suggestion.\nThe new i QCs were prepared using mother alloys containing 15% Dy, 62\u201368% Au, and 23\u201317% Ga. The mother alloys were synthesized via arc-melting followed by rapid quenching. The resultant i QCs were studied using powder X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, electron diffraction, and magnetic susceptibility measurements.\nThe researchers found that the synthesized i QC was polycrystalline with a highly pure ferromagnetic phase. They were further able to describe the mean-field-like nature of the ferromagnetic transition.\nThe researchers also discovered that the new i QCs exhibit a maximum Weiss temperature, a significant parameter in ferromagnetic transition, at an electrons-per-atom (e/a) ratio of 1.70, which aligns with previous findings for ACs. This discovery demonstrates that the magnetic properties of i QCs can be well tuned using the Weiss temperature and e/a ratio (a parameter that indicates the variations in the Fermi energy of the i QC).\nFurthermore, these findings reveal that the balance of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions, as well as the presence of exotic magnetic orders, can be tuned in i QCs by shifting the Fermi energy or adjusting the e/a ratio.\n\"The discovery of pure tunable ferromagnetic quasicrystals has the potential to revolutionize and expand the academic system based on crystals. Applying our findings to current theoretical work in the field, for example, in the realm of non-coplanar spin configurations such as hedgehog and whirling configurations, can lead to various nontrivial physical properties in i QCs, including anomalous and topological Hall effects,\" concludes Prof. Tamura.\nThese findings pave the way toward new frontiers of magnetic materials and advance the development of technologies such as magnetic data storage, spintronics, and magnetic sensors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHigh Phase-Purity and Composition-Tunable Ferromagnetic Icosahedral Quasicrystal, Physical Review Letters (2023).

   "text": "In recent years, many physicists worldwide have introduced atomic clocks, systems to measure the passing of time that are based on quantum states of atoms. These clocks can have numerous valuable applications, for instance in the development of satellite and navigation systems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLately, some researchers have also been exploring the possible development of molecular clocks, systems that resemble atomic clocks, but based on simple molecules. A team at Columbia University and University of Warsaw recently created a highly accurate molecular clock that could be used to study new physical phenomena.\n\"Our recent paper is the result of a multi-year effort to create what is called a molecular clock,\" Tanya Zelevinsky, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org. \"It was inspired by the rapid progress in the precision of atomic clocks, and the realization that molecular clocks rely on a different 'ticking' mechanism and thus could be sensitive to complementary phenomena. One of these is the idea that the fundamental constants of nature might change very slightly over time. The other is the possibility that gravity between very small objects may be different from what we experience at larger scales.\"\nThe molecular clock created by Zelevinsky and her colleagues is based on the diatomic molecule Sr2, structurally resembling two tiny spheres connected by a spring. The clock specifically uses the vibrational modes of this molecule as a precise frequency reference, which in turn allows it to keep track of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n                An image of the ultracold molecules broken up into atoms used by the researchers.

They found that their proposed design minimized sources of errors significantly and their clock achieved a total systematic uncertainty of 4.6\u00d710\u221214, exhibiting a notably high precision.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our recent work sets the benchmark for the precision of molecular spectroscopy, with the observed measure of the peak sharpness\u2014or its quality factor\u2014of 3 trillion,\" Zelevinsky said. \"It also illuminates the effects that limit this precision, in particular, the eventual loss of molecules via scattering of the light in which they are trapped. This inspires us to search for improvements in the optical trapping strategy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                Small shifts of the clock resonance position with the wavelength of the trapping light (color-coded) currently limit the accuracy of the vibrational clock.

Leung.\n             \n\n\nThe vibrational molecular clock created by this team of researchers could become a standard for terahertz frequency applications, while also potentially informing the creation of new molecular spectroscopy tools. Its design could also be altered, substituting the Sr2 molecules with other isotopic variants (with different mass), which could aid ongoing searches for new physical interactions.\n\"In the future, we hope to apply the molecular clock to understand molecular structure at the highest precision and to study any possible signatures of non-Newtonian gravity at nanometer size scales,\" Zelevinsky added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tK.

A generalized temporal transfer matrix formalism was developed to study the radiation of a stationary charge in APTCs. It was found that APTCs can enable radiation of the stationary charge and manage emission features due to their reconfigurable anisotropic band structure in momentum space.\nIn contrast with the nonresonant tunable laser based on PTCs, the extreme lasing directionality in APTCs is achieved due to their inherent anisotropic band structure, which does not require source manipulation, such as precise control of the movement of free charges for delicate phase matching required to sustain the radiation process. This approach greatly extends the concept of nonresonant tunable PTC lasers to the scenarios of stationary charges, opening a new avenue within a research area to control radiation of charges.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHuanan Li et al, Stationary Charge Radiation in Anisotropic Photonic Time Crystals, Physical Review Letters (2023).

   "text": "Smartphones could one day become portable quantum sensors thanks to a new chip-scale approach that uses organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) to image magnetic fields, with significant implications for use in health care and industry settings.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNSW researchers from the ARC Center of Excellence in Exciton Science have demonstrated that OLEDs, a type of semiconductor material commonly found in flat-screen televisions, smartphone screens and other digital displays, can be harnessed to map magnetic fields.\nThe latest research, led by Dr. Rugang Geng and Professor Dane McCamey from the UNSW School of Physics, has been detailed in Nature Communications.\n\"Our findings show that OLEDs, a commercially available technology, can be used not only for displays and lighting, but also for quantum sensing and magnetic field imaging by integrating a small piece of microwave electronics,\" says first author of the study, Dr. Rugang Geng.\n\"If this technology is properly developed, people could simply use their smartphones to map the magnetic fields around them, for example to spot defects in diamonds or jewelry. This also has applications in industry, such as finding defects in construction materials or as a biomedical sensor.\"\nHow does this technology work? \nOLEDs are a new display technology that provides some of the best quality screens in smartphones and TVs.\n\"The basic working principle of an OLED device is that when a voltage is applied, electrons and holes are injected into different layers of the device,\" says Dr. Geng. \"When the electrons and holes meet in the central layer, they form 'excitons,' which emit visible light when they decay, and that's what makes OLEDs useful as displays and lighting sources.\"\nThis light emission process exploits the charge characteristics of electrons, which have a negative charge, and holes, which have a positive charge. They both also have another intrinsic property called spin.\n\n\n\n\n\n                The spin property of electrons and holes, which meet in the middle layer of the device, either point up or down and are very sensitive to external magnetic fields. Credit: University of New South Wales\n             \n\n\nThis spin either points up or down and is very sensitive to external magnetic fields. In fact, it can \"flip-flop\" (or switch direction) under magnetic resonance conditions.\n\"By measuring the signal change, both in electric current and emission light, induced by such a flip-flop, we are able to detect the strength of any magnetic field the device is exposed to,\" says Dr. Geng.\nBy integrating an OLED with a microwave resonator, Dr. Geng, Prof. McCamey and their colleagues have generated a tiny oscillating magnetic field across the OLED device, allowing each individual pixel of the OLED screen to act as a small magnetic field sensor.\n\"We weren't surprised at the result\u2014we have been pursuing this for a few years,\" says Prof. McCamey. \"But we were surprised at the resolution of the images we could make\u2014we can see details on sub-micron length scales, similar to the size of a bacteria or neuron.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nCommercialization and everyday uses \nThis latest research represents the next step in the development of magnetic field imaging equipment. Existing quantum sensing and magnetic field imaging equipment tends to be large and expensive, requiring either additional power from a high-powered laser, or extremely low temperatures. Under these conditions, the device integration potential and commercial scalability is limited.\nHowever, the new technique developed by the team can function at a microchip scale and doesn't require input from a laser, showing great potential for applications in scientific research, industry and medicine.\n\"Next, we hope to improve the overall performance of the device including optimizing the device architecture and exploring other techniques that can significantly increase the field sensitivity,\" says Dr. Geng.\n\"We are also exploring collaborations with OLED technology companies as their experience at moving devices from the lab to commercial products will help accelerate translation of this technology.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRugang Geng et al, Sub-micron spin-based magnetic field imaging with an organic light emitting diode, Nature Communications (2023).

The findings of the study are published in the journal Physical Review Applied.\nDr. Tamma said, \"Our technique exploits the quantum interference occurring when two single photons impinging on the two faces of a beam-splitter are indistinguishable when measured at the beam splitter output channels. If, before impinging on the beam splitter, one photon is delayed in time with respect to the other by going through or being reflected by the sample, one can retrieve in real time the value of such a delay and therefore the structure of the sample by probing the quantum interference of the photons at the output of the beam splitter.\n\"We showed that the best precision in the measurement of the time delay is achieved when resolving such two-photon interference with sampling measurements of the two photons in their frequencies. Indeed, this ensures that the two photons remain completely indistinguishable at detectors, irrespective of their delay at any value of their sampled frequencies detected at the output.\"\nThe team proposed the use of a two-photon interferometer to measure the interference of two photons at a beam-splitter. They then introduced a technique based on frequency-resolving sampling measurements to estimate the time delay between the two photons with the best possible precision allowed by nature, and with an increasing sensitivity at the decreasing of the photonic temporal bandwidth.\nDr. Tamma added, \"Our technique overcomes the limitations of previous two-photon interference techniques not retrieving the information on the photonic frequencies in the measurement process.\n\"It allows us to employ photons of the shortest duration experimentally possible without affecting the distinguishability of the time-delayed photons at the detectors, and therefore maximizing the precision of the delay estimation with a remarkable reduction in the number of required pairs of photons. This allows a relatively fast and efficient characterization of the given sample paving the way to applications in biology and nanoengineering.\"\nThe applications of this breakthrough research are significant.

It results in multiple drops spattered in the air,\" said author Alexander Yarin. \"Some of these drops are big enough to be significantly distorted and torn apart by the air drag forces acting on a drop in flight. Smaller droplets arise during this process, which is called secondary atomization.\"\nThe team examined different starting droplet sizes and confirmed their model with experiments. They found the effect of secondary atomization was significant and predictable: The smaller droplets were easier to sweep up by the firearm's gases and turn around toward the victim.\n\"Muzzle gases form a turbulent vortex ring which moves toward a victim from a shooter and pushes the blood droplets from the shooter back to the victim,\" said Yarin. \"Droplets are also deflected aside, and our predictions showed that some can even land behind the victim, even though initially they were moving from the victim toward the shooter.\"\nThis discovery could explain how a short-range shooter might stay clean from blood stains, like in the famous case of Phil Spector presumably murdering Lina Clarkson while keeping his outfit practically clean.\n\"The results reveal the usefulness of multiphase flow fluid mechanics for the forensic discipline of back spatter analysis,\" said Yarin. \"Hopefully, code based on the present results would be used in future crime scene investigations.\"\nIn the future, the group is interested in studying the spatter of brain tissue in similar short-range shooting events.

Consisting of an excited electron coupled to a lower-energy electron vacancy or hole, an exciton is typically short-lived, surviving only until the electron and hole recombine, which limits its usefulness in applications.\n\"If we want to make progress in quantum computing and create more sustainable electronics, we need longer exciton lifetimes and new ways of transferring information that don't rely on the charge of electrons,\" said Alessandra Lanzara, who led the study. Lanzara is a senior faculty scientist at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and a UC Berkeley physics professor. \"Here we're leveraging topological material properties to make an exciton that is long lived and very robust to disorder.\"\nIn a topological insulator, electrons can only move on the surface. By creating an exciton in such a material, the researchers hoped to achieve a state in which an electron trapped on the surface was coupled to a hole that remained confined in the bulk. Such a state would be spatially indirect\u2014extending from the surface into the bulk\u2014and could retain the special spin properties inherent to topological surface states.\nThe team used a state-of-the-art technique that Lanzara helped pioneer, known as time-, spin-, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, which uses ultrafast pulses of light to probe the properties of electrons in a material. They worked with bismuth telluride, a well-studied topological insulator that offered the precise properties they needed: an electronic state combining the topological surface characteristics with those of the insulating bulk.\n\"We knew that bismuth telluride had the right electronic structure to support a spatially indirect exciton, but finding the right experimental conditions took hundreds of hours,\" said Lanzara. \"It was a huge joy for everyone when we saw the excitonic state we were looking for.\"\nThe team studied the formation of the excitonic state and characterized its interaction with other charge carriers in the material. These observations already constituted a breakthrough, but the team went a step further by also measuring the state's spin character and demonstrating the persistence of the topological material's strong spin polarization in the excitonic state.\n\"We studied this new excitonic state and found that it does indeed inherit characteristics of both excitons and topological states,\" said first-author Ryo Mori, who worked on this project as a postdoctoral scholar and is now a faculty member at the University of Tokyo. \"This finding opens up opportunities for future applications that combine properties of both, such as opto-spintronics and possibly new quantum information technology.\"\n\"This work is just the beginning, and many mysteries remain in the fundamental properties,\" Mori continued. \"For example, we still cannot conclude the hole's spin in the current measurement. How does spin affect the exciton pairing mechanism? And then, how do we control the properties of this state so we can use it in an application?\"\nThe research is published in the journal Nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRyo Mori et al, Spin-polarized spatially indirect excitons in a topological insulator, Nature (2023).

However, knowing the precise mechanism underlying quasiparticle dynamics is important in order to optimize device performance and provide a pre-requisite to operate photon detectors. Despite intense research efforts, physicists remain to understand the processes at risk during the energy relaxation of quasiparticles in current carrying superconductors.\nIn a recent proposal, experimental physicists had developed an all-metal Josephson field-effect transistor, which relied on regulating its critical current after applying a gate voltage. This gave rise to considerable controversy since it suggested a heating-effect after injecting high-energy quasiparticles. Previous experiments also routinely employed a method; however, it prevented the disentanglement between current and voltage effects, which Jalabert and colleagues overcame by using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to locally inject quasiparticles into a super-conducting nanowire and simultaneously measure its critical current.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Scanning critical current microscopy. a, Nanowire shape. b, The critical current (dots) as a function of the STM tip position x along the nanowire and averaged along y for different tunnelling conditions at T\u2009=\u2009180\u2009mK and the critical current (dashed lines) obtained from the numerical solutions of equation (1) for \u03a3\u2009=\u20096\u2009\u00d7\u2009109 \u2009W\u2009K\u22125\u2009m\u22123.

Physicists and materials scientists had previously focused on combining atomic force microscopy and STM, although both methods are technically tedious. In this study, Jalabert and the team used STM to locate and measure the nanodevice and studied six superconducting nanowires with different niobium/gold nominal total thickness.\nThey measured the critical current after injecting quasiparticles in the middle of the nanowire, and noted how the critical current depended on the injected power. In a thermodynamic framework, each quasiparticle injected into the setup relaxed its energy to phonons, which thereby broke hundreds of Cooper pairs to generate many out-of-equilibrium quasiparticles that formed the so-called hotspot. This down-conversion cascade occurred in a very short time-frame in the order of picoseconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n                The effect of the power injected by quasiparticles on the electronic temperature. a, The normalized critical current measured without quasiparticle injection Ic(T/Tc) I0c, where I0c is the critical current value at T\u2009=\u20090 K as a function of the reduced temperature. b, The reduced electronic temperature as a function of the quasiparticle power injected by the STM tip.

DOI: 10.1038/s41567-023-01999-4\n             \n\n\nHotspot dynamics\nUsing scanning tunneling microscopy, Jalabert and colleagues mapped the current as a function of the tip position for fixed tunneling conditions. As the position of the tip moved away from the leads or as the injected power increased, the critical current decreased further. The physicists determined the local electronic temperature from the measured critical current and noted a remarkable agreement between the one-dimensional heat model. All experimental data were in support of a hot quasiparticle-induced thermally driven reduction of the critical current. They showed how an excess of quasiparticles in the hotspot reduced the density of Cooper pairs available to carry the superfluid current, which agreed with previous studies.\nThe hotspot dynamics relied on the balance between the proliferating quasiparticles in the down-conversion cascade and their escape through diffusion. In the models described herein, only the growing number of out-of-equilibrium quasiparticles mattered. The time of hotspot formation was 40 picoseconds, which matched the time required for quasiparticle diffusion across the width of the nanowire. The team intend to conduct further studies to solve the coupled kinetic equations of interacting quasiparticles and phonons; beyond the scope of the present work.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Relaxation dynamics of the injected quasiparticles.

DOI: 10.1038/s41567-023-01999-4\n             \n\n\nOutlook\nIn this way, T. Jalabert and colleagues formed a powerful new method to study the dynamics of local quasiparticles in superconducting nanostructures to tune the tunneling rate and quasiparticle energy. The physicists used the experimental setup to show how the critical current of a nanowire could be significantly reduced by injecting a quasiparticle injection current of several magnitudes lower.\nThey credited the outcome to the phenomenon of thermal heating of quasiparticles; the results have an immediate impact on the function of superconducting nanodevices such as field-effect transistors and photon detectors, with added capacity to design superconducting quantum circuits with improved effects of quasiparticles in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tT.

   "text": "It is one of the most exciting races in modern physics: How can we produce the best superconductors that remain superconducting even at the highest possible temperatures and ambient pressure? In recent years, a new era of superconductivity has begun with the discovery of nickelates. These superconductors are based on nickel, which is why many scientists speak of the \"nickel age of superconductivity research.\" In many respects, nickelates are similar to cuprates, which are based on copper and were discovered in the 1980s.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut now a new class of materials is coming into play: In a cooperation between TU Wien and universities in Japan, it was possible to simulate the behavior of various materials more precisely on the computer than before.\nThere is a \"Goldilocks zone\" in which superconductivity works particularly well. And this zone is reached neither with nickel nor with copper, but with palladium. This could usher in a new \"age of palladates\" in superconductivity research. The results have now been published in the journal Physical Review Letters.\nThe search for higher transition temperatures\nAt high temperatures, superconductors behave very similar to other conducting materials. But when they are cooled below a certain critical temperature, they change dramatically: their electrical resistance disappears completely and suddenly they can conduct electricity without any loss. This limit, at which a material changes between a superconducting and a normally conducting state, is called the critical temperature.\n\"We have now been able to calculate this critical temperature for a whole range of materials. With our  modeling on high-performance computers, we were able to predict the phase diagram of nickelate superconductivity with a high degree of accuracy, as the experiments then showed later,\" says Prof. Karsten Held from the Institute of Solid State Physics at TU Wien.\nMany materials become superconducting only just above absolute zero (-273.15\u00b0C), while others retain their superconducting properties even at much higher temperatures. A superconductor that still remains superconducting at normal room temperature and normal atmospheric pressure would fundamentally revolutionize the way we generate, transport and use electricity.\nHowever, such a material has not yet been discovered. Nevertheless, high-temperature superconductors, including those from the cuprate class, play an important role in technology\u2014for example, in the transmission of large currents or in the production of extremely strong magnetic fields.\nCopper, nickel or palladium?\nThe search for the best possible superconducting materials is difficult: there are many different chemical elements that come into question. You can put them together in different structures, you can add tiny traces of other elements to optimize superconductivity. \"To find suitable candidates, you have to understand on a quantum-physical level how the electrons interact with each other in the material,\" says Prof. Karsten Held.\nThis showed that there is an optimum for the interaction strength of the electrons. The interaction must be strong, but also not too strong. There is a \"golden zone\" in between that makes it possible to achieve the highest transition temperatures.\nPalladates as the optimal solution\nThis golden zone of medium interaction can be reached neither with cuprates nor with nickelates\u2014but one can hit the bull's eye with a new type of material: so-called palladates. \"Palladium is directly one line below nickel in the periodic table. The properties are similar, but the electrons there are on average somewhat further away from the atomic nucleus and each other, so the electronic interaction is weaker,\" says Karsten Held.\nThe model calculations show how to achieve optimal transition temperatures for palladium data. \"The computational results are very promising,\" says Karsten Held. \"We hope that we can now use them to initiate experimental research. If we have a whole new, additional class of materials available with palladates to better understand superconductivity and to create even better superconductors, this could bring the entire research field forward.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMotoharu Kitatani et al, Optimizing Superconductivity: From Cuprates via Nickelates to Palladates, Physical Review Letters (2023).

   "text": "The promise of superconductivity for electrical power transmission and transportation has long been held back by high costs. Now researchers from the University of Houston and Germany have demonstrated a way to cut the cost and upend both the transit and energy transport sectors by using superconductors to move people, cargo and energy along existing highway infrastructure.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe combined system would not only lower the cost of operating each system but would also provide a way to store and transport liquified hydrogen, an important future source of clean energy. The liquified hydrogen would be used to cool the superconductor guideway as it is stored and transported, reducing the need for a separate specialized pipeline system capable of cooling the fuel to 20 degrees Kelvin, or minus 424 Fahrenheit.\nThe concept, described in a paper published on April 24, 2023 in the journal APL Energy, suggests a future in which air travel and traditional freight transport could become obsolete, replaced by a \"super system\" allowing personal and commercial vehicles to travel at speeds up to 400 miles an hour\u2014maybe even twice that fast.\n\"I call it a world-changing technology,\" said Zhifeng Ren, director of the Texas Center for Superconductivity at UH, who came up with the concept and is a corresponding author on the paper. \"Superconductivity has had such promise to transmit electric power without power loss, to power magnetically levitating, super-fast trains and for energy storage. But it has not been economically viable, which is why it hasn't happened at large scale yet.\"\nThe modern era of superconductivity research began in 1987, when a team led by UH physicist Paul Chu discovered a compound that acted as a superconductor at a temperature above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. Since then, demonstration projects have proven that superconductors can be used to power magnetically levitated trains and to transmit electrical power without energy loss, reducing waste.\nTechnical details remain to be resolved, said Ren, who is also M.D. Anderson Chair Professor of Physics. \"But the learning curve should not be steep since we have learned a lot during the past 40 years or so.\"\nFinancing will be another challenge. While this proof-of-concept paper does not include an economic analysis, he said combining transit and energy systems and using existing roadways would lower the cost substantially compared to that of any individual system. That, along with the project's potential long-term economic and environmental benefits, would outweigh the upfront costs, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagnetically levitating trains traditionally operate on a magnetized rail, with superconductors embedded in the train undercarriage. This concept flips that, embedding superconductors into the existing highway infrastructure and adding magnets to the undercarriages of vehicles, which avoids having to cool the superconductors on each vehicle. Instead, the liquified hydrogen would cool the superconductors as it moves across the system, with liquified nitrogen and a vacuum layer used to thermally insulate the liquified hydrogen.\nResearchers built a model to demonstrate the key technical aspect of the concept\u2014levitating a magnet above a superconductor guideway. Liquified nitrogen was used to cool the superconductors in the model; Ren said future models will use hydrogen.\nVehicles with magnetized undercarriages\u2014trains, cargo trucks, even personal vehicles\u2014would enter the superconductor guideway, levitating and moving at high speed to reach their destinations. After leaving the guideway, vehicles would continue their trips powered by traditional electric or internal combustion motors.\nPeople would be able to travel at their own convenience while enjoying the time-saving benefits of high-speed trains and air travel, Ren said. \"Instead of 75 mph, you could go 400 mph, from Houston to Los Angeles, or Houston to New York in just a few hours.\"\nFuel or electrical power consumption would drop dramatically while the car or truck was on the superconductor guideway, reducing both the cost and the environmental footprint, he said.\n\"All those benefits together, I think it could change the world.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOleksii Vakaliuk et al, A multifunctional highway system incorporating superconductor levitated vehicles and liquefied hydrogen, APL Energy (2023).

   "text": "Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes are a type of light wave that can carry the external torque of photons as they move through space. They are useful in many fields, from optical communications to super-resolution imaging. Advanced developments in these and other applications demand reliable and color-tunable LG mode laser sources, which do not yet exist.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn optical parametric oscillator (OPO) is a device that can generate a wavelength-tunable laser beam, so it has been used to realize a color-tunable LG laser source\u2014generally, in one of two ways. One way is to change a regular beam into an LG beam using a phase component outside the OPO, but this makes the LG beam less pure. The other way is to utilize higher-order resonator mode so that it can create LG at source directly, but this has been a work in progress.\nAs reported in Advanced Photonics Nexus, a team from Nanjing University and Sun Yat-Sen University recently developed a two-facing \"Janus\" OPO scheme for generating high-efficiency, high-purity broadband LG modes with tunable topological charge. The Janus resonator consists of two cavity mirrors, a periodically poled lithium niobate crystal, a Faraday rotator, a quarter wave plate, and a vector vortex wave plate.\nDifferent from previous intracavity mode conversion schemes based only on self-reproductions of the phase and polarization, the Janus OPO introduces an additional imaging system into the resonator to assist self-reproduction of complex wavefront, which greatly improves LG OPO performance.\nThe Janus cavity mode is composed of two different modes that intersect. The mode at the front end of the resonator is a Gaussian-like pattern, which can better match the Gaussian pump light to obtain high gain. At the output end, the cavity mode gradually and smoothly evolves into a standard LG mode, which ensures high-purity LG beam output and effectively reduces the diffraction loss. On the other hand, the reconstruction of the intensity distribution during the imaging process actively forms a high-purity LG mode\u2014rather than passive mode filtering\u2014which further reduces resonator losses.\nAccording to corresponding author Yong Zhang, Professor of Physics at Nanjing University, \"The Janus OPO largely reduces the loss of the resonator through imaging design and improves the efficiency and purity of the output LG beam.\" The output LG mode has a tunable wavelength between 1.5 \u03bcm and 1.6 \u03bcm, with a conversion efficiency above 15%, a controllable topological charge up to 4, and a mode purity as high as 97%.\nZhang notes, \"The efficiency of the OPO can be further improved by double-passing the pump light, and the wavelength band of the output LG beam has the potential to expand to visible and ultraviolet, offering a powerful tool to explore the interaction between LG beams and matter, for potential applications like super-resolution imaging based on stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and precise rotation sensing.\"\nAccording to Dunzhao Wei, Associate Professor in the School of Physics at Sun Yat-Sen University and first author on the report, \"The scheme of Janus OPO can be further expanded to vector beam output and entangled LG photon generation, directions that will play important roles in areas such as atomic ensemble spin-orbit interaction, laser fabrication, and higher-entanglement quantum sources.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDunzhao Wei et al, Generation of high-efficiency, high-purity, and broadband Laguerre-Gaussian modes from a Janus optical parametric oscillator, Advanced Photonics Nexus (2023).

For the speed potential to be realized, the quantum computer needs to operate several hundred of qubits simultaneously without having them unintentionally interfering with each other.\nAs an alternative technology to that existing today in quantum processors, superconducting flux qubits provide several important advantages: First, they are very fast and reliable; and second, it may be simpler to integrate many flux qubits into a processor compared to current available technology.\nComparing a quantum computer to a piano, Dr. Michael Stern, of the Department of Physics and Quantum Entanglement Science and Technology (QUEST) Center at Bar-Ilan University, says, \"Imagine wanting to play a certain note on a piano, but actually playing a number of keys together simultaneously and inadvertently, since the distance between the various keys isn't large enough.\"\n\"One of the main advantages of flux qubits is that- the 'pianist' can always produce the sound he wants to produce due to the ample separation between 'keys',\" says Dr. Stern. \"But of course, you need to tune the keys of your piano before playing.\"\nIn an article recently published in the journal Physical Review Applied, Stern and his partners describe this added ability.\nIn keeping with the piano analogy, the technological complication encountered by flux qubits until recently was a difficulty in controlling and changing their \"tone\". It was almost impossible to change the frequency of a flux qubit without destroying its coherence.\nIn the recent paper the researchers showed that they could not only control the production of the qubits, but also actively change their frequency without compromising their performance. \"The flux qubit allows keys to be disconnected from one another,\" says Stern. \"Just like in a symphony, it isn't enough just to have keys that function, but also the ability to tune and control the keys independently of each other in order to work in unison.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tT.

   "text": "For years, Ville Pulkki has been wondering why it feels so difficult to shout upwind. The sensation is common enough to have found its way into an idiom about not being understood. But Pulkki, a professor of acoustics at Aalto University, wanted a scientific explanation for the phenomenon\u2014and there wasn't been one.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a new study published in Scientific Reports, Pulkki's research team showed that our common sense understanding of this situation is wrong. It isn't harder to shout into the wind; it's just harder to hear yourself.\nIn fact, acousticians have long known that sound carries better within the first 100 meters upwind. Many people have noticed that a siren sounds louder as it approaches and then quieter as it moves away. The mechanics behind this is similar to the Doppler effect, in which a sound changes frequency as it moves.\nPulkki's earlier research had confirmed that wind doesn't affect the emanation pattern of speech, so there was no reason why shouting into the wind would be difficult. He therefore asked one of his master's students, Rapolas Daugintis, to study whether the phenomenon was due to how we hear. Daugintis carried out measurements and simulations to test the idea, and Senior Researcher Timo L\u00e4hivaara from the University of Eastern Finland contributed acoustic and flow field simulations.\nTheir results were surprising but simple: it's harder for people to hear themselves when shouting upwind.\n\"When someone shouts upwind, their ears are situated downwind from their mouth, which means that their ears receive less sound\u2014it's harder from them to hear their shout than when there's no wind,\" says Pulkki.\nThe same thing happens when someone is moving quickly even if there's no wind blowing\u2014if you're cycling, for example. As a person bikes, their motion generates a wind around their head even in stationary air, and they end up shouting because they can't hear their own voice well.\nSo be careful what you shout upwind, for others might hear you just fine, even if you don't. This information is particularly useful for people who work with sound, such as musicians.\n\"My musician friend told me that when they have to sing on a sailboat, they always sit with their back against the wind in order to not strain their voice. The same phenomenon is at play here: because it's harder for my friend to hear themself when singing upwind, it makes them unknowingly sing louder than usual,\" says Pulkki.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVille Pulkki et al, Perceived difficulty of upwind shouting is a misconception explained by convective attenuation effect, Scientific Reports (2023).

   "text": "There is so much that we do not yet know about neutrinos. Neutrinos are very light, chargeless, and elusive particles that are involved in a process called beta decay. Understanding this process may reveal the origin of matter in the universe.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeta decay is a type of radioactive decay that involves a neutron converting into a proton emitting an electron and an antineutrino. Beta decay is very common\u2014it occurs about a dozen of times per second in, for example, a banana. There might also be an ultra-rare kind of beta decay that emits two electrons but no neutrinos.\nNuclear physicists around the world are searching for this neutrinoless-double beta decay (NLDBD) in different nuclei. The interest in these decays arises from their potential to reveal unsolved mysteries related to the universe's creation of matter. They can also provide hints toward our understanding of the currently unknown mass of neutrinos.\nThe Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events (CUORE) can search for these rare NLDBD processes using different nuclei. Scientists rely on complementarity among searches using different nuclei to better understand the underlying physics in the process. Complementarity in physics involves theories that contrast with each other but that both explain part of the same phenomena.\nCUORE recently searched for NLDBD using a nucleus that had not previously been studied with CUORE, Tellurim-128. The researchers have so far found no evidence for NLDBD. However, they show that the half-life of Tellurim-128 to decay by NLDBD is longer than 3.6 septillion years (ultra-rare decays have very long half-lives). This lower limit is about 30 times higher than those found from prior experiments using the same technique. This new search extends scientists' knowledge on these rare nuclear decays. The findings are published in Physical Review Letters.\nCUORE is one of the world-leading experiments searching for extremely rare nuclear processes. CUORE needs a very low-radioactivity environment, which is achieved by using extremely clean materials and by using the Gran Sasso Mountain, which shields the experiment from cosmic rays. CUORE consists of almost 1,000 crystals that are kept at a temperature close to absolute zero by a dedicated refrigeration structure. The temperature of the crystals is measured 1,000 times per second, saved to disk, and analyzed to spot the tiny amount of temperature variations caused by the rare decays.\nSince the beginning of its operation in 2017, CUORE has collected a huge amount of data, and it will continue for at least two more years. Researchers expect better results in the search for NLDBD processes on the nucleus Tellurim-128 in the near future. After CUORE, the next-generation of experiments have the potential to unravel several nuclear and particle physics mysteries through the exploration of these elusive processes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tD.

   "text": "Modern-day technologies like optical computing, integrated photonics, and digital holography require light signals to be manipulated in three dimensions. To achieve this, it is necessary to be able to shape and guide the flow of light according to its desired application. Given that light flow within a medium is governed by the refractive index, specific tailoring of the refractive index is needed to realize control of the light path within the medium.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo this end, scientists have developed what are called \"aperiodic photonic volume elements\" (APVEs), microscopic voxels with specific refractive indices located at predefined positions to direct the flow of light in a controlled manner. However, sculpting these elements requires a high degree of precision, and most light-shaping materials are limited to 2D configurations or end up degrading the output light beam profile.\nIn a recent study published in Advanced Photonics Nexus (APNexus), researchers led by Alexander Jesacher from the Medical University of Innsbruck in Austria proposed a simple approach to fabricating highly precise APVEs for a range of applications. The method uses a technique called \"direct laser writing\" for the 3D arrangement of voxels of specific refractive indices inside borosilicate glass.\nIn their study, the researchers designed an algorithm that stimulates the flow of light through a medium to determine the optimum placement of voxels for achieving the necessary precision. Based on this, they were able to generate between 154,000 and 308,000 voxels, each occupying a volume of approximately 1.75 \u00b5m \u00d7 7.5 \u00b5m \u00d7 10 \u00b5m, within just 20 minutes. Additionally, they used dynamic wavefront control to compensate for any spherical aberration (beam profile distortion) during the focusing of laser on the substrate. This ensured the consistency of each voxel profile at all depths within the medium.\nThe team developed three types of APVEs to demonstrate the applicability of the method: an intensity shaper for controlling the intensity distribution of the input beam, an RGB multiplexer that manipulated the transmission of the red-green-blue (RGB) spectra of the input beam, and a Hermite\u2013Gaussian (HG) mode sorter to enhance data transfer speeds.\nThe team used the intensity shaper to convert a Gaussian beam into a microscopic smiley-shaped light distribution, followed by the multiplexer to represent different parts of the smiley distribution in different colors, and finally the HG mode sorter to convert multiple Gaussian mode inputs delivered by the optical fibers into HG modes. In all cases, the devices were able to transmit the input signal without significant loss and achieved a record-high diffraction efficiency of up to 80 percent, setting a new benchmark for the standard of APVEs.\n\"The results reported in this paper greatly advance the field of ultrafast laser direct writing. The novel method could open doors to an ideal low-cost platform for a rapid prototyping of highly integrated 3D light shapers,\" says APNexus Editorial Board Member Paulina Segovia-Olvera of the Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education at Ensenada (CICESE). \"The demonstration of a solid method for producing consistent, reproducible, and reliable APVEs not only adds to the current knowledge in the field but also enables new avenues in applied photonics,\" she adds.\nThe method, in addition to its simplicity, low cost, and high precision, can probably also be extended to other substrates, including nonlinear materials. \"The flexibility of our method could make it viable for designing a wide range of 3D devices for applications in information transport, optical computing, multimode fiber imaging, nonlinear photonics, and quantum optics,\" concludes Jesacher.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNicolas Barr\u00e9 et al, Direct laser-written aperiodic photonic volume elements for complex light shaping with high efficiency: inverse design and fabrication, Advanced Photonics Nexus (2023).

   "text": "Hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, is found everywhere from the dust filling most of outer space to the cores of stars to many substances here on Earth. This would be reason enough to study hydrogen, but its individual atoms are also the simplest of any element with just one proton and one electron. For David Ceperley, a professor of physics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, this makes hydrogen the natural starting point for formulating and testing theories of matter.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCeperley, also a member of the Illinois Quantum Information Science and Technology Center, uses computer simulations to study how hydrogen atoms interact and combine to form different phases of matter like solids, liquids, and gases. However, a true understanding of these phenomena requires quantum mechanics, and quantum mechanical simulations are costly. To simplify the task, Ceperley and his collaborators developed a machine learning technique that allows quantum mechanical simulations to be performed with an unprecedented number of atoms. They reported in Physical Review Letters that their method found a new kind of high-pressure solid hydrogen that past theory and experiments missed.\n\"Machine learning turned out to teach us a great deal,\" Ceperley said. \"We had been seeing signs of new behavior in our previous simulations, but we didn't trust them because we could only accommodate small numbers of atoms. With our machine learning model, we could take full advantage of the most accurate methods and see what's really going on.\"\nHydrogen atoms form a quantum mechanical system, but capturing their full quantum behavior is very difficult even on computers. A state-of-the-art technique like quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) can feasibly simulate hundreds of atoms, while understanding large-scale phase behaviors requires simulating thousands of atoms over long periods of time.\nTo make QMC more versatile, two former graduate students, Hongwei Niu and Yubo Yang, developed a machine learning model trained with QMC simulations capable of accommodating many more atoms than QMC by itself. They then used the model with postdoctoral research associate Scott Jensen to study how the solid phase of hydrogen that forms at very high pressures melts.\nThe three of them were surveying different temperatures and pressures to form a complete picture when they noticed something unusual in the solid phase. While the molecules in solid hydrogen are normally close-to-spherical and form a configuration called hexagonal close packed\u2014Ceperley compared it to stacked oranges\u2014the researchers observed a phase where the molecules become oblong figures\u2014Ceperley described them as egg-like.\n\"We started with the not-too-ambitious goal of refining the theory of something we know about,\" Jensen recalled. \"Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, it was more interesting than that. There was this new behavior showing up. In fact, it was the dominant behavior at high temperatures and pressures, something there was no hint of in older theory.\"\nTo verify their results, the researchers trained their machine learning model with data from density functional theory, a widely used technique that is less accurate than QMC but can accommodate many more atoms. They found that the simplified machine learning model perfectly reproduced the results of standard theory. The researchers concluded that their large-scale, machine learning-assisted QMC simulations can account for effects and make predictions that standard techniques cannot.\nThis work has started a conversation between Ceperley's collaborators and some experimentalists. High-pressure measurements of hydrogen are difficult to perform, so experimental results are limited. The new prediction has inspired some groups to revisit the problem and more carefully explore hydrogen's behavior under extreme conditions.\nCeperley noted that understanding hydrogen under high temperatures and pressures will enhance our understanding of Jupiter and Saturn, gaseous planets primarily made of hydrogen. Jensen added that hydrogen's \"simplicity\" makes the substance important to study. \"We want to understand everything, so we should start with systems that we can attack,\" he said. \"Hydrogen is simple, so it's worth knowing that we can deal with it.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHongwei Niu et al, Stable Solid Molecular Hydrogen above 900 K from a Machine-Learned Potential Trained with Diffusion Quantum Monte Carlo, Physical Review Letters (2023).

Those faced a lot of resistance from society. There was one-sided communication to the public with the goal of increasing public understanding. But that didn't necessarily result in people embracing those technologies. Quantum technology is still in the early phases, so we have an opportunity to approach it in a different way where we really engage people.\"\nAccording to group leader Cramer, it is critical to consider the societal impact. \"This technology can have a lot of impact on society. That's precisely why we need to know how to have meaningful conversations about this and how to make sure that this new technology connects with the desires and expectations of society.\"\nAnalyzing hundreds of videos\nSo we want to learn from the past, but how? Meinsma explains how she conducts her research. \"To see how quantum technologies are communicated, we looked at four potential problems in about 500 TEDx talks. These problems include the portrayal of quantum as spooky, or the lack of explanation of the underlying physics concepts.\"\nThe choice of looking at TEDx talks is not accidental. \"The videos aim to inspire and the speaker is in direct contact with the audience. In addition, the transcripts of thousands of videos are easily accessible.\" Even so, the Ph.D. candidate still ended up having to watch several hundred videos herself to check the automatic transcriptions. \"I was happy when I finished,\" she laughs.\nMeaningful communication about quantum\n\"We saw that those four problems were certainly present, but not always dominant. One striking result is that the benefits of quantum technologies are mentioned more than six times more than the risks,\" Meinsma says. \"Also, the talks are very often about the quantum computer, whereas quantum networks and sensors might have an impact on society much sooner.\"\nMeinsma hopes that the results of the study will be put to good use. \"My ambition is that scientists check with themselves how they can bring their story in such a way that it is valuable to the public. For example, not just talking about the benefits, but thinking more broadly about the benefits as well as the risks. In this way, we can create more support for quantum technologies even before they actually exist.\"\nThe study is published in the journal Quantum Science and Technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAletta Lucia Meinsma et al, Is everything quantum 'spooky and weird'?

   "text": "Where did all the antimatter go? After the Big Bang, matter and antimatter should have been created in equal amounts. Why we live in a universe of matter, with very little antimatter, remains a mystery. The excess of matter could be explained by the violation of charge-parity (CP) symmetry, which essentially means that certain processes that involve particles behave differently to those that involve their antiparticles.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the CP-violating processes that have been observed so far are insufficient to explain the matter\u2013antimatter asymmetry in the universe. New sources of CP violation must be out there\u2014and might be hiding in interactions involving the Higgs boson. In the Standard Model of particle physics, Higgs-boson interactions with other particles conserve CP symmetry. If researchers find signs of CP violation in these interactions, they could be a clue to one of the universe's oldest mysteries.\nIn a new analysis of its full dataset from Run 2 of the LHC, the ATLAS collaboration tested the Higgs-boson interactions with the carriers of the weak force, the W and Z bosons, looking for signs of CP violation. The collaboration studied Higgs-boson decays into two Z bosons, each of which transforms into a pair of leptons (an electron and a positron or a muon and an antimuon), thus resulting in four charged leptons. The researchers also studied interactions in which two W or Z bosons combine to produce a Higgs boson. In this case, one quark and one antiquark are produced together with the Higgs boson, creating 'jets' of particles in the ATLAS detector.\nThese interactions are ideal testing grounds for CP violation. When CP symmetry is conserved, the pattern of behavior of the detected jets and leptons should be the same when particles are exchanged with their antiparticles and their directions of flight are reversed. However, if CP symmetry is violated, particles and antiparticles behave differently.\nATLAS scientists summarize all the information about the particles detected in these processes in a single number: the optimal observable. A special feature of this observable is that its value measured for antiparticles should be equal but opposite in sign to that of the particles. If a process conserves CP symmetry, the mean value of the optimal observable in the data should be zero. If it doesn't, the mean value would shift away from zero.\nIn its new analysis now published on the arXiv preprint server, ATLAS used the observed values of the optimal observable to directly place limits on the possible amount of CP violation. The researchers also measured how often each value of the optimal observable occurred in the data, after correcting for any experimental effects.\nThis measurement enabled ATLAS to compare the data with theoretical predictions in a model-independent way and to test the validity of the underlying theoretical assumptions. This is the first time that a measurement of a Higgs-boson decay into four leptons has allowed physicists to detect potential signs of CP violation in a model-independent way, without strongly relying on aspects of the Standard Model prediction other than CP symmetry.\nAll the results look compatible with the Standard Model expectation, representing another important confirmation of the current theory of nature. However, this is just the first step. Small CP-violating signals remain compatible with the data, and ATLAS is already collecting new collision data at unprecedented energies that will allow the precision of these measurements to be increased\u2014further homing in on the nature of the Higgs boson.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAtalas Collaboration, Test of CP-invariance of the Higgs boson in vector-boson fusion production and its decay into four leptons, arXiv (2023).

The portability of this type of accelerator is valuable for cultural heritage diagnostics because moving fragile and precious objects such as artworks and frescoes, even over short distances, can be challenging\u2014or sometimes frankly impossible\u2014due to logistical, economic and safety issues.\nMACHINA is the product of collaboration between CERN and INFN that started in 2017 and is based on a radio-frequency-quadrupole accelerating cavity designed at CERN. Following intensive testing in the second half of 2022, when all the initial requirements were met, the accelerator will soon become operational at the INFN-LABEC laboratory, where the first measurements using ion beam analysis (IBA) on reference samples will be carried out.\nThe accelerator will later be transferred to the Opificio delle Pietre Dure (OPD) in Florence, a renowned center for art conservation, where it will become a part of their regular diagnostic activities. MACHINA will be used to analyze works of art in a non-destructive manner, using IBA techniques that allow measurements to be performed on a variety of objects that would otherwise be impossible to analyze because they are too fragile or too large to move. Although based in OPD, MACHINA can be further transported for in situ measurements at other museums or conservation sites.\nMACHINA's compact design, which features a 1m\u2013long accelerating radio-frequency cavity, offers a portable solution that has a smaller impact on its surroundings in terms of footprint, weight, component availability, cost and noise compared to conventional IBA systems.

It may also lead to far faster data transmission capabilities than those existing today, applications that showcase the huge potential of next-generation organic semiconductors.\nTo understand why state-of-the-art displays have a brightness cutoff, we must first consider the property of light known as handedness, or chirality, a term derived from the Greek word for \"hand.\" Its meaning depends on the context. In physics, chirality refers to the self-rotation of particles in relation to their motion. When photons or electrons flow, they move in space, but they also spin. When these particles spin in the same direction in which they travel, as a bullet does, we call their chirality right-handed; when they spin against that direction, they have left-handed chirality.\nIn biology and chemistry, chirality refers to objects that are mirror images of each other, like two hands. For example, DNA, proteins and most other naturally occurring organic molecules are termed right-handed. And there is considerable interplay between different types of chirality. For instance, the geometric chirality of molecules in an organic material determines the chirality of particles passing through them.\nThis is relevant to many display applications because these displays have a transparent outer layer made of a chiral material, which allows only one-handed light\u2014say, right-handed\u2014to pass in and out, blocking the entry of photons of the other chirality. It does this to neutralize incoming ambient light, whose chirality is mixed; if allowed to pass through, this light would lower the screen's contrast, making it difficult to view in daylight.\nThe one-handed transparent layer is essential for operating displays in bright light (try using your smartphone to navigate at high noon without it), but it's wasteful. When the diodes of modern screens emit light\u2014which generally has a mixed chirality\u2014toward the screen's surface, half of this light's photons cannot reach the viewer, as their chirality doesn't match that of the transparent outer layer, which is fixed to neutralize ambient light.\nBut this may be about to change.\nIn the new study, Yan and his team proposed controlling the chirality of photons in ways previously deemed impossible. The proposal involves diodes that will predominantly emit light of one chirality\u2014the one that matches the chirality of the transparent outer layer. This can be achieved by creating diodes that simultaneously emit light in opposite directions\u2014one facing forward, the other backward\u2014and are outfitted with a back panel coated with a polymer containing a chiral organic material.\nHalf of the diode's light, the one that has a chirality matching the transparent layer, traverses this layer unhindered. But the remaining half is not lost. Rather, it bounces back and forth until hitting the back polymer panel of the diode, which flips its chirality. This polymer is engineered in such a way that the chirality information it contains is efficiently converted into the rotation of electrons, and then into the chirality of light, leading to strongly polarized light emission.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nStrange findings, an inevitable outcome of the theory\nThe study began with experimental results that initially appeared to be downright bizarre.\nDr. Li Wan, then a postdoctoral fellow at Link\u00f6ping University in Sweden, found what we now know to be a method for controlling and amplifying the chirality of light in organic devices.\n\"These findings ran so counter to everything that was known in this field, other scientists had a hard time believing Wan's results. They said that something was probably wrong with his experiments,\" recalls Yan.\nWan and his Ph.D. supervisor, Prof. Alasdair Campbell, had shown that they could flip the chirality of an electron flow in their experimental installation by changing the polarity of the battery generating the electric current. Each time they flipped the polarity of the power supply, the chirality of the electron flow changed consistently. As they didn't change the materials, this finding was contrary to all textbook knowledge at the time.\nCampbell was convinced they were on to something important, but he passed away in 2021, before Wan could back up his findings theoretically. Following Campbell's death, Wan sought out Yan, whose online lecture on chirality he had heard. In that lecture, Yan talked about his theory which, using concepts of quantum physics, explained how the chirality of a material determines the chirality of an electron flow.\nYan started analyzing Wan's experiments with Wan and two other scientists, Dr. Yizhou Liu of Weizmann's Condensed Matter Physics Department and Prof. Matthew J. Fuchter of Imperial College London. Yan had to extend his theory of chirality so that it would explain Wan's results, but Yan ended up showing that these findings were actually an inevitable outcome of his own theory. Moreover, the scientists found they could also control the chirality of light emitted by the electron flow by making sure that the photons fly out along the same trajectory as the flow, thus preserving their bullet-like spinning.\n\"We've revealed an intriguing unity between seemingly unrelated aspects of chirality: the structural geometry of a material, the handedness of an electron flow and finally, the handedness of light,\" Yan says, summing up the new study.\nApart from improving the efficiency of our screens, the study's findings could also be applied to achieving speedy data transmission. They could, for instance, be used to create optical switches that will work vastly faster than any mechanical ones, flipping the chirality of the photon flow\u2014say, right-handed to denote 0, and left-handed, 1\u2014by switching the electric polarity.\nAnd last but not least, yet another outcome of this research is that textbooks will need to be updated to account for Yan's theory of chirality.\nThe findings are published in the journal Nature Photonics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLi Wan et al, Anomalous circularly polarized light emission in organic light-emitting diodes caused by orbital\u2013momentum locking, Nature Photonics (2022).

It has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\n\"This work shows that we can use particle shape to create a material that forms an extremely low density glass,\" said Urbach. \"We've engineered thin filaments whose geometry creates a frustrated, completely jammed solid even though there is no chemical linking between the filament, and they take up only a very small fraction of the space\"\nThe study leverages the remarkable properties of the flagella of bacteria\u2014the microscopic \"tails\" that the organisms use for propulsion. For most bacteria, the flagella are rigid helical filaments, which the bacteria rotate to generate propulsive force, somewhat like the propeller of a really really tiny ship.\nThere are mutant strains of bacteria that grow flagella that are straight, rather than helical, and by using novel synthesis techniques, the group at UC Santa Barbara, led by Prof. Zvonimir Dogic, was able to generate chimeric filaments, composed of a segment of straight flagella fused to a helical one. Other team members included Ph.D. students at Georgetown and Brandeis Universities, as well as a research scientist at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) in Lyon, France.\n\n\n\n\n\n                (A) A fluorescently labeled straight filament in a background suspension of unlabeled filaments preferentially diffuses along its long axis.

Schematics of different filament shapes with the background filaments are shown on the Bottom. Credit: Yardimci et al.\n             \n\n\nWhen suspended in water, these tiny filaments exhibit Brownian Motion, the random fluctuations in position described by the botanist Robert Brown in 1827 when observing pollen grains under a microscope, and quantitatively explained by Albert Einstein in 1905, providing one of the first widely-accepted demonstrations of the existence of atoms and molecules. The PNAS study investigated the dramatic changes that can occur when a bunch of the filaments are added to the suspension.\nThe straight filaments are free to diffuse along their length, and thus stay mobile even though they are partially caged by their neighbors. The helical filaments can also diffuse along their length, but only by \"corkscrewing\" to escape their cages. For the chimeric filaments, by contrast, the straight tails suppress the corkscrewing, and as a result the filaments are completely stuck, even though the filaments only take up a very small fraction of the suspension volume.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe group investigated how this caging affected the mechanical properties of the suspension, and in particular they performed precise measurements of the stiffness of the material. They showed that the straight and helical filament suspensions behave like viscous liquids, while the chimeric filaments produce a glass-like solid, albeit a very soft one.\nThis work shows that shape can be used to control dynamics and mechanics, leveraging the remarkable properties of self-assembled natural materials. Emerging technologies will enable researchers to fabricate similar shapes from synthetic materials, providing powerful avenues for engineering adaptive materials with novel properties.\n\"The dramatic influence of shape on mechanics could dovetail with another topical area, that of dynamically shape-changing metamaterials,\" said Olmsted. \"In the future one could design materials from analogous objects that can switch between fluid and solid (glass) by a chemical, optical, or electrical trigger, in applications such as robotics, protective devices and equipment, and (re)structuring fabrics.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSevim Yardimci et al, Bonded straight and helical flagellar filaments form ultra-low-density glasses, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

   "text": "Non-classical states of light such as single photons and entangled photons are key ingredients for chips dedicated to quantum computation, quantum sensing, quantum measurement, etc. Fabrication of a traditional chip is hard, but with billions of dollars of specialized equipment (and guys in white bunny suits) it can be done. Fabrication of a quantum chip is even harder. In addition, sources of non-linear light are needed, and making these light sources fabricable is essential.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction of \u2248 20 \u00b5m non-classical light sources is demonstrated in \"Canonical Resonant Four-Wave-Mixing in Photonic Crystal Cavities: Tuning, Tolerances and Scaling.\" The paper hails from the four corners of France plus the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Maryland. They start by discussing quantum resonators that generate non-classical states of light, like the microring and photonic crystal (PhC) cavity.\nThe researchers had made the \"exotic\" choice, the photonic crystal, and developed the first Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) operating at room temperature with a microwatt-level continuous wave pump. Indium Gallium Phosphide (InGaP) is used, rather than silicon. The test vehicle was designed to operate in the telecom spectral range though the emission spectrum can be engineered easily. They demonstrated repeatability in the fabrication process and the ability to reach efficient parametric conversion using very low pump power (\u2248 40 \u00b5W), a key to conserving energy.\nThe device emits correlated photons, and quadrature-squeezed vacuum below, and while below and approaching a threshold, both being resources for quantum information. Above the threshold, the OPO emits correlated beams of coherent light by efficiently converting the power of the pump. This is the point where this publication starts. It is a \"Chapter 2\" as it were, providing more measurements on the OPO and examining issues like tuning, quality, tolerances, and scaling.\nThe paper, published in the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics, is quite a read. Photons from the pump decay, squeezed light, whispering gallery modes, degenerate cases\u2014classic science fiction. But wait, a plot twist: time-energy entangled photon pairs and conditions of \"gentle\" confinement. Woah.\nThe delightful language of photonic integrated circuits for quantum computing belies its seriousness. There's a reason that NIST, the Commerce Department Lab, is involved. NIST oversees cybersecurity technology. If bad actors get their quantum chips made before we do, then they can break any code. As the authors explain, the quantum advantage vis-a-vis today's digital chips is that quantum mechanics within a crystal allows for non-exponential scaling where fantastically complex math is concerned.\nSo back to photonic crystal cavities we go.\nThe paper's Section II is a deep-dive into the concept of canonical resonant Four-Wave-Mixing (FWM), meaning FWM occurs in a cavity allowing the interaction of only three modes (four in the non-degenerate case). The use of \"canonical\" here refers to the details of a Hamiltonian matrix transformation (math).\nThey defend their choice of a PhC cavity visa vie ring resonators, when considering structural disorder. They show how to create a resonator with a prescribed number of modes, and not more. This is important because extra modes imply a larger volume for the resonator. More importantly, each of these modes can be controlled independently, i.e., their frequency spacing, and quality factor can be designed to be different.\nThis translates into a superior control over the parametric processes, ensuring that only the desired interactions efficiently take place, thereby suppressing parasitic effects. Admitted, practically achieving this degree of control is extremely challenging.\nIn Section III the authors compare the properties of three geometries of PhC multimode resonators. The photonic crystal is made of a 200 nm thin layer of In0.5Ga0.5P with a two-dimensional pattern of holes.\nSection IV reports on a detailed statistical analysis of a batch of new devices. The authors show that structural disorder induces uncorrelated \ufb02uctuations of the modes of the same resonator. Here is where the tuning mechanism is discussed in detail. In Section V the authors compare theory and experiment on parametric oscillation in 11 OPOs, with good agreement on threshold and slope ef\ufb01ciency.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexandre Chopin et al, Canonical Resonant Four-Wave-Mixing in Photonic Crystal Cavities : tuning, tolerances and scaling, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics (2022).

   "text": "Even if you are not a quantum physicist, you will most likely have heard of Schr\u00f6dinger's famous cat. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger came up with the feline that can be alive and dead at the same time in a thought experiment in 1935. The obvious contradiction\u2014after all, in everyday life we only ever see cats that are either alive or dead\u2014has prompted scientists to try to realize analogous situations in the laboratory. So far, they have managed to do so using, for instance, atoms or molecules in quantum mechanical superposition states of being in two places at the same time.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt ETH, a team of researchers led by Yiwen Chu, professor at the Laboratory for Solid State Physics, has now created a substantially heavier Schr\u00f6dinger cat by putting a small crystal into a superposition of two oscillation states. Their results, which have been published this week in the journal Science, could lead to more robust quantum bits and shed light on the mystery of why quantum superpositions are not observed in the macroscopic world.\nCat in a box\nIn Schr\u00f6dinger's original thought experiment, a cat is locked up inside a metal box together with a radioactive substance, a Geiger counter and a flask of poison. In a certain time-frame\u2014an hour, say\u2014an atom in the substance may or may not decay through a quantum mechanical process with a certain probability, and the decay products might cause the Geiger counter to go off and trigger a mechanism that smashes the flask containing the poison, which would eventually kill the cat.\nSince an outside observer cannot know whether an atom has actually decayed, he or she also doesn't know whether the cat is alive or dead\u2014according to quantum mechanics, which governs the decay of the atom, it should be in an alive/dead superposition state. (Schr\u00f6dinger's idea is commemorated by a life-size cat figure outside his former home at Huttenstrasse 9 in Zurich).\n\"Of course, in the lab we can't realize such an experiment with an actual cat weighing several kilograms,\" says Chu. Instead, she and her co-workers managed to create a so-called cat state using an oscillating crystal, which represents the cat, with a superconducting circuit representing the original atom. That circuit is essentially a quantum bit or qubit that can take on the logical states \"0\" or \"1\" or a superposition of both states, \"0+1.\"\nThe link between the qubit and the crystal \"cat\" is not a Geiger counter and poison, but rather a layer of piezoelectric material that creates an electric field when the crystal changes shape while oscillating. That electric field can be coupled to the electric field of the qubit, and hence the superposition state of the qubit can be transferred to the crystal.\n\n\n\n\n\n                In the ETH Zurich experiment, the cat is represented by oscillations in a crystal (top and blow-up on the left), whereas the decaying atom is emulated by a superconducting circuit (bottom) coupled to the crystal. Credit: ETH Zurich\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimultaneous oscillations in opposite directions\nAs a result, the crystal can now oscillate in two directions at the same time\u2014up/down and down/up, for instance. Those two directions represent the \"alive\" or \"dead\" states of the cat. \"By putting the two oscillation states of the crystal in a superposition, we have effectively created a Schr\u00f6dinger cat weighing 16 micrograms,\" explains Chu. That is roughly the mass of a fine grain of sand and nowhere near that of a cat, but still several billion times heavier than an atom or molecule, making it the fattest quantum cat to date.\nIn order for the oscillation states to be true cat states, it is important that they be macroscopically distinguishable. This means that the separation of the \"up\" and \"down\" states should be larger than any thermal or quantum fluctuations of the positions of the atoms inside the crystal. Chu and her colleagues checked this by measuring the spatial separation of the two states using the superconducting qubit. Even though the measured separation was only a billionth of a billionth of a meter\u2014smaller than an atom, in fact\u2014it was large enough to clearly distinguish the states.\nMeasuring small disturbances with cat states\nIn the future, Chu would like to push the mass limits of her crystal cats even further. \"This is interesting because it will allow us to better understand the reason behind the disappearance of quantum effects in the macroscopic world of real cats,\" she says.\nBeyond this rather academic interest, there are also potential applications in quantum technologies. For instance, quantum information stored in qubits could be made more robust by using cat states made up of a huge number of atoms in a crystal rather than relying on single atoms or ions, as is currently done. Also, the extreme sensitivity of massive objects in superposition states to external noise could be exploited for precise measurements of tiny disturbances such as gravitational waves or for detecting dark matter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarius Bild et al, Schr\u00f6dinger cat states of a 16-microgram mechanical oscillator, Science (2023).

   "text": "The elastocaloric effect is a phenomenon where a material displays a temperature change when it is exposed to a mechanical stress. The change in temperature occurs due to an entropy difference resulting from a martensitic transformation accompanied by material's crystal structure change under stress.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn analogous effect is observed when the rubber band is stretched: its polymer chains line up in an ordered manner, causing its entropy to decrease. This leads to the rubber band discharging heat to its surroundings and becoming warmer. When the rubber band is released, the opposite occurs, and the rubber band cools down.\nLike rubber bands, metallic superelastic shape memory alloys (SMAs) can also utilize the elastocaloric effect for cooling. Copper (Cu)-based SMAs consisting of Cu, aluminum (Al), and zinc (Zn) are particularly promising due to their low cost and modest stress demands for triggering the temperature lift. However, Cu-Al-Zn SMAs suffer from cyclical fatigue issues as their coarse crystal grains and numerous grain boundaries are susceptible to fracture from repeated expansion and contraction.\nNow, in a study published in the Journal of Physics: Energy, Professor Kenjiro Fujimoto from Tokyo University of Science, Professor Ichiro Takeuchi from the University of Maryland, along with researchers from Maryland Energy & Sensor Technologies, have developed a highly durable Cu-Zn-Al SMA capable of withstanding a high number of cyclic loads. \"We have been searching for conditions to promote the grain growth of 68Cu-16Al-16Zn alloy to improve its elastocaloric properties,\" says Prof. Fujimoto, explaining the motivation behind their study.\nRecently,  they reported that subjecting Cu-Al-Mn alloys to repeated heating and cooling across the mixed and high-temperature phases increased the grain size of the material. Intrigued by these findings, the team decided to investigate whether similar phase transformations could enhance the properties of Cu-Zn-Al alloys.\nTo prepare the Cu-Al-Zn alloys, the researchers combined Cu, Al, and Zn in a carbon crucible. They melted the metals at low pressures to suppress zinc volatilization. Once the alloy was prepared, the researchers cooled and rolled it into 7 mm thick ingots at three different rolling rates (0%, 67%, and 83%, respectively). The phase boundary temperatures of the alloy were then determined using high-temperature X-ray diffraction, which revealed that the phase boundary between the mixed phase and the high-temperature phase occurred between 700\u00b0C and 750\u00b0C. Based on this, the researchers repeatedly heated and cooled the alloy between 500\u00b0C and 900\u00b0C.\nAll the ingots subjected to the heat treatment cycle showed an increase in crystal grain size, with the maximum increase observed in alloys rolled at a rate of 67%. The grain size of the pristine ingot was 2.21 mm, but the average grain size of the heat-treated ingot in this group increased to 11.1 mm.\n\"The results indicate that heat treatment across the periodic phase boundary, in addition to the 67 % rolling ratio, is effective for single crystalline-like grain growth,\" says Prof. Fujimoto. With its larger grains, and fewer grain boundaries, the heat-treated alloy was much more resistant to fracture and was able to withstand more than 60,000 mechanical cycles at 2% strain.\nThe heat treatment process also resulted in significant improvements in the elastocaloric properties of the Cu-Zn-Al alloy. Compared to previously reported alloys of the same composition, the heat-treated alloy showed latent heat of 6.3 J/g on releasing strain, which is more than double the previously measured value of 2.3 J/g. This indicates that the heat-treated alloy can cool more effectively. Additionally, the alloy exhibited adiabatic temperature difference of +5.9 K and -5.6 K on loading and unloading, respectively, at low cyclic loads (106 MPa).\nWhile rubber band refrigerators have not become mainstream, the elastocaloric effect has the potential to provide innovative cooling solutions. Therefore, developing materials that can achieve this purpose is crucial. In this regard, the heat-treated Cu-Zn-Al alloy exhibits promising properties and can pave the way for efficient and cost-effective cooling systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYuya Kawarada et al, Abnormal grain growth of 68Cu\u201316Al\u201316Zn alloys for elastocaloric cooling via cyclical heat treatments, Journal of Physics: Energy (2023).

   "text": "Physicists from the University of Utrecht and the Faculty of Physics at the University of Warsaw have observed\u2014for the first time experimentally\u2014the Brazil nut effect in a mixture of charged colloidal particles.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil now, it was thought that an influx of external energy was required to create this effect\u2014but the researchers were able to confirm that the process can occur spontaneously. The findings, published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), could find applications in a wide range of fields, from geology to soft matter physics.\nSurely it has ever happened to you to shake an open bag of mixed nuts. Have you noticed that after such a procedure, the largest nuts in the mixture\u2014Brazil nuts\u2014float to the top? The phenomenon of large objects rising to the surface of a mixture of small objects, bearing the professional name of granular convection, is popularly referred to \"the Brazil nut effect\" and occurs commonly in nature. It can also be observed by shaking, for example, a bucket of sand and pebbles.\nThis unusual effect contradicts the intuition that heavier objects should sink to the bottom due to gravity and inertia force. This is the case with the phenomenon of sedimentation, common in nature, a process involving the sinking of solid particles dispersed in a liquid, under the influence of gravity or inertia forces. Sedimentation plays a role in processes such as the formation of sedimentary rocks, and is also used to purify water and wastewater or isolate cells from blood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSedimentation profile in a binary suspension of large (green) and small (red) particles at an overall volume fraction of 0.02.

However, theoretical models being developed suggested that the phenomenon could occur spontaneously, without the supply of external energy. The theoretical calculations were confirmed experimentally for the first time by a group of experimental and theoretical physicists from the University of Utrecht and the Faculty of Physics at the University of Warsaw.\n\"We have shown that the Brazil nut effect can take place in a mixture of charged colloidal particles driven solely by Brownian motions and repulsion of electric charges,\" emphasizes Jeffrey Everts from the Faculty of Physics at the University of Warsaw, who, under the direction of Ren\u00e9 van Roij of the Institute for Theoretical Physics of the Utrecht University, carried out the theoretical calculations for the experiment. Marjolein van der Linden, working under the direction of Alfons van Blaaderen of the Debye Institute for Nanomaterials Science of the Utrecht University, was responsible for the experimental part of the study.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nColloidal mixture\nThe researchers used charged polymethylmethacrylate particles with different diameters (large and small) to carry out the experiment. A low-polar solvent, cyclohexyl bromide, was used as a dispersing agent.\nAs the researchers point out, although in both granular (e.g., nut) and colloidal mixtures the \"Brazil nut effect\" occurs, the mechanisms for its formation are completely different. In the case of a nut mixture, as a result of shaking, smaller nuts fill in the gaps created at the bottom, pushing the larger nuts to the top.\nMeanwhile, the charged particles in the colloid make Brownian motion as a result of collisions with the surrounding solvent molecules. \"Each particle is positively charged. Heavier but larger particles have a greater charge, so they repel each other more strongly, making them move upward more easily than smaller but lighter particles,\" Jeffrey Everts explains.\nThe discovery of the \"Brazil nut effect\" in mixtures of colloidal particles can be used in many fields from geology to soft matter physics. It can also find application in industry such as in the stability of paint and ink.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarjolein N. van der Linden et al, Realization of the Brazil-nut effect in charged colloids without external driving, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

The experiments were done at the University of Arizona, where Zhang was working at the time.\nOptomechanical sensors measure forces that disturb a mechanical sensing device that moves in response. That motion is then measured with light waves. In this experiment, the sensors were membranes, which act like drum heads that vibrate after experiencing a push. Optomechanical sensors can function as accelerometers, which can be used for inertial navigation on a planet that doesn't have GPS satellites or within a building as a person navigates different floors.\nQuantum entanglement could make optomechanical sensors more accurate than inertial sensors currently in use. It could also enable optomechanical sensors to look for very subtle forces, such as identifying the presence of dark matter. Dark matter is invisible matter believed to account for five times more of the mass in the universe than what we can sense with light. It would tug on the sensor with gravitational force.\nHere's how entanglement improves optomechanical sensors:\nOptomechanical sensors rely on two synchronized laser beams. One of them is reflected from a sensor, and any movement in the sensor changes the distance that the light travels on its way to the detector. That difference in distance traveled shows up when the second wave overlaps with the first. If the sensor is still, the two waves are perfectly aligned.\nBut if the sensor is moving, they create an interference pattern as the peaks and troughs of their waves cancel each other out in places. That pattern reveals the size and speed of vibrations in the sensor.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nUsually in interferometry systems, the further the light travels, the more accurate the system becomes. The most sensitive interferometry system on the planet, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, sends light on 8-kilometer journeys. But that's not going to fit in a smartphone.\nTo enable high accuracy in miniaturized optomechanical sensors, Zhang's team explored quantum entanglement. Rather than splitting the light once so that it bounced off a sensor and a mirror, they split each beam a second time so that the light bounced off two sensors and two mirrors. Dalziel Wilson, an assistant professor of optical sciences at the University of Arizona, along with his doctoral students Aman Agrawal and Christian Pluchar, built the membrane devices.\nThese membranes, just 100 nanometers\u2014or 0.0001 millimeters\u2014thick, move in response to very small forces.\nDoubling the sensors improves the accuracy, as the membranes should be vibrating in sync with each other, but the entanglement adds an extra level of coordination. Zhang's group created the entanglement by \"squeezing\" the laser light. In quantum mechanical objects, such as the photons that make up light, there is a fundamental limit on how well the position and momentum of a particle can be known. Because photons are also waves, this translates to the phase of the wave (where it is in its oscillation) and its amplitude (how much energy it carries).\n\"Squeezing redistributes the uncertainty, so that the squeezed component is known more precisely, and the anti-squeezed component carries more of the uncertainty. We squeezed the phase because that is what we needed to know for our measurement,\" said Yi Xia, a recent Ph.D. graduate from Zhang's lab at the University of Arizona and co-corresponding author of the paper.\nIn squeezed light, the photons are more closely related to one another. Zhang contrasted what happens when the photons go through a beam splitter with cars coming to a fork in the freeway.\n\"You have three cars going one way and three cars going the other way. But in quantum superposition, each car goes both ways. Now the cars on the left are entangled with the cars on the right,\" he said.\nBecause the fluctuations in the two entangled beams are linked, the uncertainties in their phase measurements are correlated. As a result, with some mathematical wizardry, the team was able to get measurements that are 40% more precise than with two unentangled beams, and they can do it 60% faster. What's more, the precision and speed is expected to rise in proportion to the number of sensors.\n\"It is envisioned that an array of entanglement-enhanced sensors will offer orders-of-magnitude performance gain over existing sensing technology to enable the detection of particles beyond the present physical model, opening the door to a new world that is yet to be observed,\" said Zhang.\nThe team's next steps are to miniaturize the system. Already, they can put a squeezed-light source on a chip that is just half a centimeter to a side. They expect to have a prototype chip with the squeezed-light source, beam splitters, waveguides and inertial sensors within a year or two.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYi Xia, Entanglement-enhanced optomechanical sensing, Nature Photonics (2023).

   "text": "The DarkSide experiment is an ambitious research effort aimed at detecting dark matter particle interactions in liquid argon using a dual-phase physics detector located at the underground Gran Sasso National Laboratory. These interactions could be observed by minimizing background signals, and this could be possible thanks to the remarkable discrimination power of the scintillation pulse of liquefied argon in the DarkSide-50 detector, which can separate nuclear recoil events associated with these interactions from more than 100 million electronic recoil events linked to radioactive background.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe large team of researchers involved in the DarkSide experiment has recently been using the detector to search for lighter dark matter particles. The results of a new search for dark matter\u2013nucleon interactions, published in Physical Review Letters, allowed them to set new constraints for sub-GeV/c2 dark matter.\n\"The DarkSide-50 experiment was designed as a test for the use of argon from underground sources, naturally depleted in the radioactive 39Ar, for very large scale dark matter searches,\" Cristiano Galbiati a Researcher at Princeton University and the Gran Sasso Science Institute, told Phys.org. \"It is remarkable to see how a group of young researchers within the collaboration was able to exploit the apparatus to extract the best limit for dark matter searches that were not part of the original scope of the experiment. If anything, the ingenuity and resolve of this group should be credited for this important result.\"\nTheoretical predictions suggest that dark matter interactions are extremely rare, several orders of magnitude less frequent than interactions caused by the radioactivity of materials in the detectors and in the surrounding environment. To reliably search for dark matter interactions, therefore, researchers must be able to suppress these confounding environmental signals, known as radioactive background.\nThe DarkSide experiment specifically searches for dark matter interactions using a noble target, specifically argon liquefied at cryogenic temperatures, at nearly 200 Celsius degrees below zero. Noble liquids are ideal targets when searching for rare physical events, as they respond to particle interactions by both emitting light, through a process known as scintillation, and liberating charges via ionization.\n\"Dual-phase time projection chambers are detectors able to measure both the scintillation light and the ionization charges,\" Paolo Agnes, a researcher at Gran Sasso Science Institute, told Phys.org. \"The bulk of the target mass is in the liquid state. A thin layer of gas is sitting on top of the liquid. The detector is equipped with light detectors, typically sensitive to single photons. By measuring the scintillation light produced in the liquid we can reconstruct the interaction energy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                Credit: Yury Suvorov, DarkSide Collaboration.\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy means of an electric field, the ionization electrons inside the DarkSide detector drift towards the surface of the liquid argon. This creates a stronger electric field on the surface of the liquid, enabling the extraction and subsequent acceleration of these ionization electrons in a gas. These accelerated electrons generate a second light burst, which generally consists of hundreds of photons for each extracted electron.\n\"By combining the scintillation and ionization signals, event vertex reconstruction is possible with precision better than 1 cm, allowing for very efficient suppression of some backgrounds, particularly the one coming from the detector surfaces,\" Agnes explained. \"A prerogative of liquid argon with respect to other liquids is the very powerful rejection of backgrounds induced by beta and gamma radioactivity, which can be suppressed by nine orders of magnitude by using the shape of the prompt scintillation signal. To further reduce the target intrinsic radioactivity, DarkSide-50 uses a specialized batch of argon, extracted from a CO2 well in Colorado, 1,000 times less radioactive than the argon, commercially available, extracted from the atmosphere.\"\nThe DarksSide-50 detector was operated for five consecutive years at the underground National Laboratory of Gran Sasso in Italy. The data collected during this time was then analyzed by researchers who are part of the DarkSide collaboration to search for dark matter interactions.\nIn 2018, the collaboration published the findings of the first background-free search for dark matter in their dual-phase liquid argon detector. By specifically focusing on argon scintillation, they can search for interactions of WIMPs inducing recoils with energy higher than 40 keV, corresponding to WIMP masses larger than 20 GeV/c2.\nRecently, the detector's potential was increased further, allowing the team to search for far lighter dark matter particles by only leveraging argon ionization. While the ionization channel is not as great as the scintillation channel for distinguishing meaningful signals from radioactive background, it lowers the threshold for the analysis of collected data down to the sub-keV range.\n\"A great effort was devoted to accurately characterize the ionization response to both electronic (background-like) and nuclear (signal-like) recoils, poorly known in such a low energy range,\" Davide Franco, a researcher at Laboratoire Astroparticule et Cosmologies CNRS / Paris 7, told Phys.org. \"The work done in this direction in 2021 allowed the detector to be calibrated to a few tens of eV], a key element for the recent results. In addition, this work extends the potential of the next generation 50-ton LAr detector (DarkSide-20k) to the detection of core-collapse supernova neutrinos via coherent elastic scattering off nuclei.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                Credit: Yury Suvorov, DarkSide Collaboration.\n             \n\n\nIn one of their previous studies, published in Physical Review D in March 2023, DarkSide researchers accurately modeled all background components in excellent agreement with the expected rates from previous detector material screening efforts. Collectively, these works improved their overall understanding of the detector, offering precious insight that is informing the creation of the DarkSide-20k, an even more advanced detector with a target 1,000 times greater than that of DarkSide-50.\nOne key novelty of the team's recent search for dark matter-nucleon interactions is that it was the first to specifically search for nuclear recoils accompanied by the emission of an electronic component (i.e., the Migdal effect) in liquid argon. While the team did not detect meaningful interactions, they were thus able to set new limits on weakly interactive massive particles (WIMPs), bringing them down to a mass of 40 MeV/c2.\n\"This result broke the generally recognized paradigm of direct dark matter searches, for which the sub-GeV/c2 range is dominated in sensitivity by solid-state technology,\" Franco explained. \"At the same time, it demonstrated the potential of a few tens of kilograms of liquid argon in such a range, compared with ton-scale liquid xenon detectors. It should not be forgotten among the achievements, those related to the search for interactions of 'leptophilic' dark matter particles, i.e., with electron final states.\"\nThe recent work by the DarkSide collaboration represents an important milestone in the ongoing quest to detect WIMPs, as it was the first direct search for sterile neutrinos interpreted as possible dark matter candidates. Currently, the Global Argon Dark Matter Collaboration is building DarkSide-20K, which will be the most advanced detector to date, set to contain a total target mass of 50 tons of liquid argon.\n\"We have designed a detector that, for a 100 t yr exposure, should see <0.2 background events (mis-identified electron-recoils (ER) and untagged neutron-induced nuclear recoils (NR)) within the 20.2 t fiducial volume, plus an expected 1.7 \u00b1 0.3 events from the unavoidable physics background of nuclear recoils produced by coherent scattering of atmospheric neutrinos (the 'atmospheric neutrino fog'),\" Claudio Savarese, a researcher at Princeton University, told Phys.org. \"A statistically significant excess of events observed in the detector then becomes a potential dark matter discovery. DarkSide-20k is designed to be most sensitive to standard WIMPs, with masses above 100 GeV/c2. Nonetheless, as for DarkSide-50, we will exploit the ionization channel to perform searches of Light Dark Matter candidates with masses down to tens of MeV/c2.\"\nGalbiati, Agnes, Franco, Savarese and their colleagues are now evaluating the sensitivity of the DarkSide-20K detector, with the hope that it will allow them to further improve existing constraints on sub-GeV dark matter. Concurrently, they are designing DarkSide-LowMass, a new dedicated experiment that will specifically focus on the search for light dark matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Credit: Yury Suvorov, DarkSide Collaboration.\n             \n\n\n\"This new apparatus builds on the technological breakthroughs of DarkSide-50 and DarkSide-20k and extends its sensitivity down to the 'solar neutrino fog,' meaning that it is so sensitive that neutrinos produced in the solar core become the main detector background,\" Savarese said. \"The studies detailing the conceptual design of DS-LM and its reach in the dark matter parameter space have been recently posted on arXiv and are currently being reviewed for publication on Physical Review D.\"\nThe DarkSide-LowMass detector will be a dual-phase time projection chamber containing an active mass of 1.5 tons of argon extracted from underground. This argon is set to undergo an active isotopic purification process, which should reduce by its content of 39Ar by a further factor of 10.\nCompared to the DarkSide-50 and DarkSide-20k detectors, DarkSide-LowMass will have an extremely light time projection chamber structure, which is expected to reduce gamma activity due to impurities in the detector materials. It will also feature a new low-threshold gamma veto system designed to further suppress the residual background rate.\n\"Additional studies and technological developments will allow to enhance DS-LM sensitivity to sub-GeV candidates for a second stage of the experiment after the first scientific runs,\" Savarese added. \"These efforts aim to boost the signal by increasing the amount of charge readout per unit of deposited energy and to lower the detector energy threshold. In essence, the power DS-LM lies in its unrivaled low rate of background events and in its agility to exploit new techniques to boost the DM signal. The road ahead is clear, and I find truly exciting to be able to push the boundaries of science to new lengths.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tP.

   "text": "Quantum theory, which was formulated in the first three decades of the twentieth century, describes a wide array of phenomena at the molecular, atomic and subatomic scales. Among its many technological applications, three have become ubiquitous in daily life: laser barcode scanners, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and the global positioning system (GPS).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNevertheless, quantum physics is still not entirely understood, and some of the phenomena concerned appear to fly in the face of common sense or everyday empirical experience, surprising not only the average layperson but also physicists and philosophers of science. Some of the counterintuitive aspects of quantum theory are due to its probabilistic nature. It offers a set of rules for calculating the probabilities of the possible measurement outcomes of physical systems and in general cannot predict the actual result of a single measurement.\nOne of the challenging ideas presented by quantum physics is non-locality, an aspect of reality manifested when two or more systems are generated or interact in such a way that the quantum states of any system cannot be described independently of the quantum states of the others. Technically speaking, scientists call such systems entangled, since they are strongly correlated even at a distance and their quantum state is not defined by the quantum states of their component parts.\nAnother challenging idea, which seems to point in the opposite direction, is contextuality, according to which the outcome of measuring a quantum object depends on the context, meaning other compatible measurements performed at the same time.\nNon-locality and contextuality were born with quantum theory but followed independent paths for several decades. In 2014, scientists conducted a study involving a particular case in which they showed that only one of them can be observed in a quantum system. This finding became known as monogamy. The authors conjectured that non-locality and contextuality were different facets of the same general behavior observed either in one way or the other.\nNow, however, a study by Brazilian and Chinese researchers has shown both theoretically and experimentally that this is not so. An article on the study is published in Physical Review Letters and highlighted as an Editors' Suggestion.\nThe research was led by Rafael Rabelo, last author of the article and a professor at the State University of Campinas's Gleb Wataghin Institute of Physics (IFGW-UNICAMP) in Brazil.\nThe first authors are Peng Xue and Lei Xiao of Beijing Computational Science Research Center in China. The other co-authors, all affiliated with Brazilian institutions, are Gabriel Ruffolo and Andr\u00e9 Mazzari, also researchers at IFGW-UNICAMP; Marcelo Terra Cunha of the same university's Institute of Mathematics, Statistics and Scientific Computing (IMECC-UNICAMP); and Tassius Tem\u00edstocles of the Federal Institute of Alagoas.\n\"We proved that both phenomena can indeed be observed concurrently in quantum systems. The theoretical approach was developed here in Brazil and validated in a quantum optics experiment by our Chinese collaborators,\" Rabelo told Ag\u00eancia FAPESP.\nThe new study shows definitively that two of the fundamental ways in which quantum physics differs from classical physics can be observed at the same time in the same system, contrary to the usual belief. \"Non-locality and contextuality, therefore, are clearly not complementary manifestations of the same phenomenon,\" Rabelo said.\nIn practical terms, non-locality is an important resource for quantum encryption, while contextuality is the basis for a specific quantum computing model, among other applications. \"The possibility of having both at the same time in the same system could pave the way to the development of new quantum information processing and quantum communications protocols,\" he said.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nBell's theorem\nThe idea of non-locality was a sort of answer to the objection raised by Albert Einstein (1879-1955) to the probabilistic nature of quantum physics. In a seminal article published in 1935, Einstein, Boris Podolsky (1896-1966) and Nathan Rosen (1909-1995), or EPR, questioned the completeness of quantum theory.\nThey proposed a thought experiment known as the EPR paradox: to justify certain non-classical correlations deriving from entanglement, distant quantum systems would have to exchange information instantly, which is impossible according to the special theory of relativity. They concluded that this paradox was due to the incompleteness of quantum theory. The incompleteness, EPR argued, could be corrected by including local hidden variables that would make quantum physics as deterministic as classical physics.\n\"In 1964, British physicist J.S. Bell (1928-1990) revisited the EPR argument, introducing an elegant formalism that encompassed all theories of local hidden variables regardless of the particular properties each variable might have. Bell proved that none of these theories could reproduce the correlations between measurements performed on two systems predicted by quantum physics. In my view, this result, later known as Bell's theorem, is one of the most important pillars of quantum physics. The property of having strong correlations that can't be reproduced by any local theory is now known as Bell non-locality. Alain Aspect, John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger were awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics for observing Bell non-locality experimentally, among other achievements,\" Rabelo said.\nAnother important result deriving from the discussion of hidden variables was presented in an article by Simon Kochen (1934-) and Ernst Specker (1920-2011), published in 1967. The authors demonstrated that, owing to the structure and mathematical properties of quantum measurements, any theory of hidden variables that reproduces the predictions of quantum physics must exhibit a contextuality aspect.\n\"Despite the common motivation, studies of Bell non-locality and Kochen-Specker contextuality followed independent paths for quite a long time. Only recently has there been growing interest in finding out whether both phenomena could be manifested concurrently in the same physical system. In an article published in 2014, Pawel Kurzynski, Ad\u00e1n Cabello and Dagomir Kaszlikowski said no. They showed why through a particular case but an interesting one, nonetheless. We've now refuted that 'no' in our study,\" Rabelo said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPeng Xue et al, Synchronous Observation of Bell Nonlocality and State-Dependent Contextuality, Physical Review Letters (2023).

   "text": "In the world of computing, we typically think of information as being stored as ones and zeros\u2014also known as binary encoding. However, in our daily life we use ten digits to represent all possible numbers. In binary the number 9 is written as 1001 for example, requiring three additional digits to represent the same thing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quantum computers of today grew out of this binary paradigm, but in fact the physical systems that encode their quantum bits (qubit) often have the potential to also encode quantum digits (qudits), as recently demonstrated by a team led by Martin Ringbauer at the Department of Experimental Physics at the University of Innsbruck.\nAccording to experimental physicist Pavel Hrmo at ETH Zurich, \"The challenge for qudit-based quantum computers has been to efficiently create entanglement between the high-dimensional information carriers.\"\nIn a study published in the journal Nature Communications the team at the University of Innsbruck now reports, how two qudits can be fully entangled with each other with unprecedented performance, paving the way for more efficient and powerful quantum computers.\nThinking like a quantum computer\nThe example of the number 9 shows that, while humans are able calculate 9 x 9 = 81 in one single step, a classical computer (or calculator) has to take 1001 x 1001 and perform many steps of binary multiplication behind the scenes before it is able to display 81 on the screen. Classically, we can afford to do this, but in the quantum world where computations are inherently sensitive to noise and external disturbances, we need to reduce the number of operations required to make the most of available quantum computers.\nCrucial to any calculation on a quantum computer is quantum entanglement. Entanglement is one of the unique quantum features that underpin the potential for quantum to greatly outperform classical computers in certain tasks. Yet, exploiting this potential requires the generation of robust and accurate higher-dimensional entanglement.\nThe natural language of quantum systems\nThe researchers at the University of Innsbruck were now able to fully entangle two qudits, each encoded in up to 5 states of individual calcium ions. This gives both theoretical and experimental physicists a new tool to move beyond binary information processing, which could lead to faster and more robust quantum computers.\nMartin Ringbauer explains, \"Quantum systems have many available states waiting to be used for quantum computing, rather than limiting them to work with qubits.\" Many of today's most challenging problems, in fields as diverse as chemistry, physics or optimization, can benefit from this more natural language of quantum computing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPavel Hrmo et al, Native qudit entanglement in a trapped ion quantum processor, Nature Communications (2023).

   "text": "A single species invades an ecosystem causing its collapse. A cyberattack on the power system causes a major breakdown. These types of events are always on our minds, yet they rarely result in such significant consequences. So how is it that these systems are so stable and resilient that they can withstand such external disruptions? Indeed, these systems lack a central design or blueprint, and still, they exhibit exceptionally reliable functionality.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the early 70s, the field of ecology was split on the question of whether biodiversity was a good or a bad thing for an ecosystem. In 1972 Sir Robert May showed, mathematically, that an increase in biodiversity causes less ecological stability. Hence, a large ecological system cannot sustain its stable functionality beyond a certain level of biodiversity and will inevitably collapse in the face of even the smallest twitch.\nMay's conclusion not only goes against current knowledge and empirical observations of real ecosystems, but, more broadly, seems to defy everything commonly known about interaction networks in social, technological and biological systems. While May's prediction suggests that all these systems are unstable, our experience is in direct contradiction. Our biology is manifested by genetic interaction networks, our brain operates based on a complex web of neuron and synapses, our social and economic systems are driven by social networks, and our technological infrastructure, from the Internet to the power grid, are all large complex networks which actually function quite robustly.\nMay himself understood the shortcomings of his solution, leading him to ask, \"What then are nature's devious strategies to ensure the stability of complex networks?\" This question, known in the field as the diversity-stability paradox, has continued to plague researchers for over five decades.\nIn a study published today (April 20, 2023) in the journal Nature Physics, researchers from Bar-Ilan University in Israel have solved this puzzle by offering, for the first time, a fundamental answer to this lingering question.\nThe researchers found that the missing piece of the puzzle in May's original formulation is that the patterns of interaction in social, biological and technological networks are highly non-random. Random networks tend to be rather homogeneous and all nodes within these networks are roughly the same. For instance, the probability of one individual having many more friends than average is tiny. Such networks may be sensitive and unstable. Real-world networks, on the other hand, are extremely diverse and heterogeneous. They include a combination of average, typically sparsely connected nodes, with ones that have many more links\u2014hubs\u2014that may be ten, 100 or even 1,000 times more connected than average.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Bar-Ilan team did the math, they found that this heterogeneity can fundamentally alter the behavior of the system. Quite surprisingly, it actually enhances stability. The analysis indicates that when a network is large and heterogeneous it acquires a guaranteed stability that is extremely robust against external forces. This clearly explains the fact that most networks around us\u2014from the Internet to our brain\u2014exhibit highly resilient functionality despite enduring constant perturbations and obstructions.\n\"This extreme heterogeneity can be seen in almost all networks around us, from genetic networks, to social and technological networks,\" says Prof. Barzel, of Bar-Ilan University's Department of Mathematics and Gonda (Goldschmied) Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center, the study's lead author.\n\"To put this in context, consider your friend on Twitter who has 10,000 followers, a thousand times the average. In everyday terms, if the average person is roughly two meters tall, such thousand-fold deviation would be tantamount to meeting a two kilometer tall individual, which is obviously impossible. But it is what we observe every day in the context of social, biological and technological networks,\" adds Barzel in explaining the strong link between abstract mathematical analysis and seemingly simple, everyday phenomena.\nLarge and heterogeneous complex networks not only can be stable, but, in fact, they often must be stable. Uncovering the rules that make a large complex system stable can offer new guidelines for tackling the pressing scientific and policymaking challenge of designing stable infrastructure networks that can not only protect against viable threats, but also strengthen the resilience of crucial, yet fragile, ecosystems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChandrakala Meena, Emergent stability in complex network dynamics, Nature Physics (2023).

   "text": "Every material possesses a unique natural vibration frequency such that when an external periodic force is applied to this material close to this frequency, the vibrations are greatly amplified. In the parlance of physics, this phenomenon is known as \"resonance.\" Resonance is ubiquitous in our daily life, and, depending on the context, could be deemed desirable or undesirable.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor instance, musical instruments like the guitar relies on resonance for sound amplification. On the other hand, buildings and bridges are more likely to collapse under an earthquake if the ground vibration frequency matches their natural frequency.\nInterestingly, natural vibration has not received much attention in material actuation, which relies on the action of mechanically responsive crystals. Versatile actuation technologies are highly desirable in the field of soft robotics. Although crystal actuation based on processes like photoisomerisation and phase transitions have been widely studied, these processes lack versatility since they require specific crystals to work.\nOne way to improve versatility is by employing photothermal crystals, which show bending due to light-induced heating. While promising for achieving high-speed actuation, the bending angle is usually small (<0.5\u00b0), making the actuation inefficient.\nNow, a team of scientists from Waseda University and Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan has managed to overcome this drawback with nothing more than the age-old phenomenon of resonated natural vibration. The team, led by Dr. Hideko Koshima from Waseda University in Japan, used 2,4-dinitroanisole \u03b2-phase crystals (1\u03b2) to demonstrate large-angle photothermally resonated high-speed bending induced by pulsed UV irradiation.\nTheir research was published in Nature Communications and made available online on March 13, 2023. \"Initially, the goal of this research was to create crystals that bend largely due to the photothermal effect. Therefore, we chose 2,4-dinitroanisole (1) \u03b2-phase crystal (1\u03b2), which has a large thermal expansion coefficient,\" explains Koshima, speaking of the team's motivation behind the study.\n\"We serendipitously discovered fast and small natural vibration induced by the photothermal effect. Furthermore, we achieved high-speed and large bending by photothermally resonating the natural vibration.\"\nIn their work, the team first cooled a methanol solution of commercially available anisole 1 to obtain hexagonal, rod-shaped 1\u03b2 single crystals. To irradiate them with UV light, they used a pulsed UV laser with a wavelength of 375 nm and observed the bending response of the crystal using a digital high-speed microscope.\nThey found that the rod-shaped 1\u03b2 crystals showed, under UV irradiation, a fast natural vibration at 390 Hz with a large photothermal bending of nearly 1\u00b0, which is larger than the value of 0.2\u00b0 previously reported in other crystals.\nFurther, the bending angle due to the natural vibration increased to nearly 4\u00b0 when irradiated with pulsed UV light at 390 Hz (same as the crystal's natural frequency). In addition to this large bending, the team observed a high response frequency of 700 Hz along with the highest energy conversion efficiency recorded till date.\nThese findings were further confirmed through simulations performed by the team. To their excitement, the simulation results showed excellent agreement with experimental data. \"Our findings show that any light-absorbing crystal can exhibit high-speed, versatile actuation through resonated natural vibrations. This can open doors to the applications of photothermal crystals, leading eventually to real-life soft robots with high-speed actuation capability and perhaps a society with humans and robots living in harmony,\" concludes Koshima.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYuki Hagiwara et al, Photothermally induced natural vibration for versatile and high-speed actuation of crystals, Nature Communications (2023).

   "text": "Stars emit light that travels through empty space without significant attenuation. The visual signal is essentially lossless until detected. After many years and billions of kilometers, starlight-photons may eventually encounter the earth's atmosphere and be decoded as a speck in the night sky by some lucky person's retina and brain.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight emitted by a pump laser may wish for the same journey lossless, but alas. For optical circuitry essential to computing and communication, light is sent through waveguides. In a silicon waveguide the light will attenuate after a few centimeters. With the right glass fiber (non-crystalline quartz silica, an oxide of silicon), photons can travel hundreds of kilometers before attenuation becomes too significant for information decoding.\nSo how does the trip across 9,000 km of trans-oceanic optical fiber communications work? Answer: Every ten kilometers, a section of fiber is loaded with erbium, a rare earth element, which acts to boost the traveling signal. (Oh, and lots of protective layers for the fiber because sharks are notorious for biting telecom/internet cabling. The exact reasons are unclear.)\nYou would think then we'd have the answer to signal amplification on a photonic integrated circuit (PIC). Chips are relatively small and the chance of a shark attack minimal. Alas, erbium-doped waveguide amplifiers had to be abandoned because their gain and output power could not match other amplifier technologies. Worse, their fabrication is incompatible with contemporary photonic integration manufacturing techniques.\nSo, the route to a lossless technology for PIC has remained an academic research topic for the last twenty years, even while \"good enough\" technologies are used for amplification/boosting of signals in today's chips and we put up with their needing lots of electricity.\nFor silicon-based PIC, non-linear photophysical properties have shown most promise. In essence, nonlinear effects enable manipulation of light by light. Being intrinsic properties, the implementation on non-linear behavior does not require special materials processing. It can be realized directly within in a standard waveguide with the right stimulation.\nEnter the collaborative work between Canadian professors Shi and LaRochelle reported in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics: \"Non-Reciprocal Sub-Micron Waveguide Raman Amplifiers, Towards Loss-Less Silicon Photonics.\" The team leverages new fabrication offerings from a foundry that manufactures PICs. The abilities of this foundry allowed the team to revisit Raman gain and amplification in a silicon photonic platform.\nRaman scattering commonly transfers photon energy from a pump laser to vibration modes. It is known to spectroscopists looking for a materials specific signature. This energy transfer can boost the intensity of a signal at the energy resonant with the lattice vibration mode. The stimulated Raman emission in silicon becomes a powerful nonlinear effect, especially when the waveguide dimensions are shrunk down.\nThe co-propagation of a 20-100 mW pump laser allows for a signal to maintain its intensity, or even be amplified. Using the same waveguide dimensions configured into an optical resonator, the same team demonstrated efficient lasing covering an extended wavelength range around 1550 nm.\nThe battle to mitigate losses in a photonic circuit finds many angles. Like glass fiber engineering, materials with lower losses such as silicon nitride have been developed and are critical for applications where amplification is not an option, in quantum photonics for example. Hybrid materials combinations appear as possible avenues both for light modulation and amplification. Proposed solutions should be guided to some extent by its integration with established fabrication methods as well as clever modifications such as this team was able to exploit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMohammad Ahmadi et al, Non-reciprocal sub-micron waveguide Raman amplifiers, towards loss-less silicon photonics, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics (2022).

   "text": "In the future, communications networks and computers will use information stored in objects governed by the microscopic laws of quantum mechanics. This capability can potentially underpin communication with greatly enhanced security and computers with unprecedented power. A vital component of these technologies will be memory devices capable of storing quantum information to be retrieved at will.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia Lorenz, a professor of physics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, studies Lambda-type optical quantum memory devices, a promising technology that relies on light interacting with a large group of atoms. She is developing a device based on hot metallic vapor with graduate student Kai Shinbrough.\nAs the researchers work towards a practical device, they are also providing some of the first theoretical analyses of Lambda-type devices. Most recently, they reported the first variance-based sensitivity analysis describing the effects of experimental noise and imperfections in Physical Review A.\n\"Prior to this paper, you would just have to assume that everything in the quantum memory behaves ideally,\" Shinbrough said. \"This is the first time that things like noise have been considered, and the results of our analyses inform experimental design.\"\nLambda-type quantum memory uses a collection of atoms that interacts with two kinds of light: single photons containing quantum information that are absorbed, and powerful laser pulses controlling when the photons' information is absorbed and released. There are several storage-and-retrieval protocols that rely on different mechanisms, and the best choice is determined by the properties of the atoms and the controlling laser pulses.\nPast analyses of these protocols assumed ideal conditions. Effects like device noise and small errors in experimental settings were not discussed. Shinbrough and Lorenz needed to understand these effects to develop a robust quantum memory device, so they filled this gap in the literature. They analyzed the impact of both random device noise and slow overall drift in experimental parameters on a Lambda-type device's memory efficiency, a measure of how often the device works as intended.\n\"The techniques we used are well established in classical physics and engineering, but we're applying them to a quantum system for the first time,\" Shinbrough said.\nIn addition to considering how noise and drift in experimental parameters individually impact device performance, the researchers used the technique of Sobol' sensitivity analysis to study how the simultaneous variation of all parameters impacts the memory efficiency. This allowed them to identify the parameters that had the most significant impact for each protocol and determine how variations in different parameters combine.\nShinbrough explained that the central result of this analysis is understanding how different experimental parameters may be tuned to compensate for imperfections in different settings. He gave the example of variation in the arrival times of the control pulse and the single photon. Each memory mechanism relies on a carefully tuned delay in the arrival times. If this delay begins to drift, then the control pulse can be made to last longer in time so the overlap with the single photon is roughly the same and the impact on memory efficiency is mitigated.\nThe results of this analysis have informed Shinbrough and Lorenz's experimental efforts. The researchers found that certain effects like variations in the hot metal vapor are often negligible while others like the characteristics of the controlling pulse can have a significant impact on experimental performance.\n\"Our analyses have allowed us to develop a better-informed experiment taking full advantage of our device's properties,\" Lorenz said. \"Moreover, we have developed a framework that allows others to perform the same analyses for their experiments.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKai Shinbrough et al, Variance-based sensitivity analysis of \u039b -type quantum memory, Physical Review A (2023).

   "text": "The ATLAS experiment has confirmed that a trio of particles\u2014a top-antitop quark pair and a W boson\u2014occurs more frequently than expected in the wake of proton-proton collisions inside the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe process that creates these three particles post-impact is quite rare: Only one out of every 50,000 collisions at the LHC produces the trio, known as ttW. After popping into existence, top quarks and W bosons are short-lived and decay almost immediately, so the team identified ttW events based on the electrons and muons into which they decay.\nMembers of the ATLAS group at the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory have spent the last three years completing a complex analysis to measure the process, including developing novel methods to estimate and remove background and detector effects to maximize the accuracy and detail of the analysis of the measurement. The results will help researchers better test theories of elementary particle physics as well as help experimentalists studying other particle physics processes.\n\"The only measurements of ttW production come from the LHC\u2014it is the first collider that can produce these types of events at a large enough rate to be measured,\" said Brendon Bullard, research associate at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and leader of this data analysis.\nA puzzling excess\nATLAS first observed the ttW process in 2015 using data collected during the LHC's Run 1, which took place between 2010 and 2012. Subsequent measurements using a subset of data collected during Run 2 (2015-2018) suggested that ttW was cropping up more than predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics, which physicists use to describe the behavior of subatomic particles.\nThe most recent measurement using the full dataset collected by ATLAS during Run 2 has led to a more precise measurement of ttW, finding the total production rate to be about 20 percent higher than theoretical predictions. Fresh results from the CMS experiment corroborate this excess.\n\"It's still unclear what exactly could be causing this discrepancy, but these results really do seem to indicate that there's something going on that we're not taking into account,\" Bullard said.\nIt's possible that new physics beyond the Standard Model is responsible.\nAlternatively, it's possible that the models used today lack necessary elements to correctly predict ttW production. Theorists make predictions from the Standard Model through piecewise approximations of increasing difficulty, and subtle effects that have not yet been incorporated into these approximations may be able to explain the discrepancy.\nEither way, theorists must now try to figure out the truth by taking these yet-to-be-calculated subtle effects into account as they approximate ttW.\n\"This is something that hasn't been done before because it's very hard. But now, with our result, there's already theorists who are interested in putting in the effort,\" Bullard said. \"This measurement will be very useful to continue to better understand the Standard Model and maybe even identify some beyond-the-Standard-Model effects if we're lucky.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nToo much can be a good thing\nIn addition to helping refine the Standard Model, studying different attributes of ttW events provides a new way for scientists to probe fundamental forces that are at play between the two quarks and W boson, including the strong interaction, which binds quarks together, and electroweak interaction, which governs electromagnetism and radioactive decay.\nBetter measurements will also aid in the study of even rarer processes occurring during proton collisions. ttW is a major background of two other processes observed at the LHC, and previously, physicists detecting these processes had to estimate ttW production and subtract it from data to find the signal they were after. Now they can use this more precise measurement of ttW to more accurately identify these rare signals.\nOne of these processes is the production of two top quarks and a Higgs boson, the particle that gives mass to certain particles, including quarks and W bosons. This event, known as ttH, is 10 times rarer than ttW when looking for the electrons and muons into which it decays. Better measurements of ttH will help physicists measure how strongly the Higgs couples with the top quark, a key test of the Standard Model that can shed light on the origin of mass.\nThe other process ttW muddles is the production of four top quarks, an event that is 50 times rarer and which ATLAS and CMS recently observed for the first time. Further examination will allow physicists to probe new physics that might involve top quarks, the most massive particle in the Standard Model.\n\"Improved understanding of the ttW process, especially with this result, can further improve the four top measurements and precision, allowing us to explore more properties of this process,\" said Zhi Zheng, research associate at SLAC who oversaw the four top quark analysis at ATLAS. She also helped Bullard with the ttW analysis. Working together at SLAC helped the pair crosscheck these linked measurements.\n\"Being at SLAC together has allowed a greater connection and collaboration between these two measurements,\" Bullard said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSLAC National Accelerator Laboratory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tParticle trio exceeds expectations at Large Hadron Collider (2023, April 19)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tretrieved 15 June 2023\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom https://phys.org/news/2023-04-particle-trio-exceeds-large-hadron.html\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This document is subject to copyright.

These gloves are a pair and therefore correlated in some way, no matter how far apart they are. One day, you place one of the gloves into your backpack and hop on a flight to travel to another country, while the other glove remains at home. According to quantum nonlocality, if you changed the color of the glove you brought with you, the color of the glove back home would instantaneously change too, despite being separated by a large distance.\nNonlocality violates many of the concepts predicted by classical physics, where particles' properties are predetermined and change occurs only through direct physical interaction or fields propagated at a finite speed. Nonlocality has a wide array of implications for understanding the future of reality, quantum mechanics, and the development of quantum technologies.\nThere exist several ways to define and interpret nonlocality. For instance, a set of mathematical expressions called the Bell and CHSH inequalities demonstrates nonlocality by violating inequalities. Meanwhile, Lucien Hardy proposed an alternative interpretation of quantum nonlocality in 1992 when he developed the Hardy Paradox.\nSuppose there are three quantities A, B, and C, where A is greater than B and B is greater than C. Intuitively, and according to a fundamental mathematical property known as the transitive property (or local hidden variable theories in physics), this would render A greater than C.\nHowever, Hardy noted that there is still room for a situation where C is greater than A. This violates the transitive property, and such violations are possible in the quantum world when particles are entangled with each other. In other words, this is nonlocality.\n\n\n\n\n\n                The nonlocal probability increases as the number of particles grows, which differs from previous studies.

They verified this by using a theoretical model and a quantum simulation.\nDespite previous studies showing the opposite, they discovered that nonlocal probability increases as the number of particles grows. This suggests that quantum effects persist even at larger scales, further challenging classical theories of physics.\nLe says these findings have important ramifications for understanding quantum mechanics and its potential applications in communications. \"Understanding quantum nonlocality can lead to groundbreaking technological advancements, such as the secure transmission of information through quantum communication via nonlocality resources.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDuc Minh Tran et al, Increased success probability in Hardy's nonlocality: Theory and demonstration, Physical Review A (2023).

OAM multiplexing affords increased channel capacity and spectral efficiency\u2014highly useful in fiber-based and free-space communications. OAM beams also have qualities that are useful for optical trapping, lattices, and more.\nUnlocking the potential of OAM has advanced thanks to persistent research efforts globally. As reported in Advanced Photonics, researchers from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and City University of Hong Kong (CityU) recently developed time-varying OAM beams using a space-time encoded digital metasurface. They used a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to control the reflection phase of the atoms at the metasurface in the microwave regime.\nBy exploiting the flexible programmability of the metasurface, they construct different modes of the time-varying OAM beams having a time-dependent phase profile in each time layer. This allows not only a time-varying topological charge but also a higher-order twist in the envelope wavefront structure of the OAM beam in terms of a nonlinear time-dependence in phase, which functions as an additional degree of freedom to allow greater capacities for application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about time-varying OAM in this video created by the authors.

In addition, a large number of acoustic topological states merge in the bulk continuum due to the lack of intrinsic symmetries such as chiral symmetry and particle-hole symmetry, and thus cannot be detected or manipulated.\nRecently, researchers from the Institute of Acoustics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IACAS), in collaboration with Wuhan University and South China University of Technology, constructed acoustic Wannier configurations by measuring spectral charges in phononic crystals (PCs), providing a quantized observable to detect the topological properties of acoustic artificial crystals.\nThe study was published in Science Bulletin on March 11.\nThey constructed two topologically distinct Wannier configurations in the two-dimensional (2D) PCs with four-fold rotation symmetry. For each phase, they integrated local density of states (LDOS) spectra over the spectrum band to obtain the spectral charges.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Corner modes induced by Wannier configurations of different Combinations.

The measured fractional spectral charges could characterize topological corner anomaly, revealing the corner mode regardless of its frequency.\nIt is worth noting that the proposed PCs of Phases A and B do not require fine-tuned boundary compensations and are robust to the possible experimental deformations. Furthermore, the Wannier configurations in different phases are naturally combined to reproduce the corner modes in band gaps. Both the ordinary and the exotic phases can serve as the cladding layers in the combined phononic crystals, providing an anomalous route to engineering in-gap corner modes.\nThe proposed paradigm has promising applications in acoustic resonators with high-quality factors and acoustic energy harvesting, as well as other classical wave systems such as elastic waves and surface acoustic waves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPeng Zhang et al, Observations of acoustic Wannier configurations revealing topological corner anomaly, Science Bulletin (2023).

They note also that prior researchers have developed two kinds of models to describe the swinging action mathematically, but both appear to suffer from deficiencies in real-world terms.\nIn this new effort, researchers attempted to improve upon both efforts by studying real-world swingers in action in a stepwise fashion. To that end, they enlisted the assistance of 10 college students, each of whom were fitted with marking devices and then rode swings with chains of various lengths the research team had set up in their lab. As the volunteers swung, the action was captured by video cameras. By analyzing the action in slow motion, the researchers were able to see what was happening at each step and to use that information to create a model.\nThe model shows that in order to initiate swinging, a person must lean their body backward, which propels the swing slightly forward. Following that, they need to lean back when the swing is at the bottom of the arc created by its movement. And then, as the swing grows longer, the person needs to lean back earlier. They also noted that as the swinger reached a certain height, they were faced with the option of maintaining their pace or continuing to push higher.\nThe researchers also noted that the adjustments made by the swingers appeared to be subconscious, as their minds appeared to be responding to the centrifugal force they were feeling.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChiaki Hirata et al, Initial phase and frequency modulations of pumping a playground swing, Physical Review E (2023).

   "text": "Quantum teleportation is a technique allowing the transfer of quantum information between two distant quantum objects, a sender and a receiver, using a phenomenon called quantum entanglement as a resource.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unique feature of this process is that the actual information is not transferred by sending quantum bits (qubits) through a communication channel connecting the two parties; instead, the information is destroyed at one location and appears at the other one without physically traveling between the two. This surprising property is enabled by quantum entanglement, accompanied by the transmission of classical bits.\nThere is a deep interest in quantum teleportation nowadays within the field of quantum communications and quantum networks because it would allow the transfer of quantum bits between network nodes over very long distances, using previously shared entanglement.\nThis would help the integration of quantum technologies into current telecommunication networks and extend the ultra-secure communications enabled by these systems to very long distances. In addition, quantum teleportation permits the transfer of quantum information between different kinds of quantum systems, e.g., between light and matter or between different kinds of quantum nodes.\nQuantum teleportation was theoretically proposed in the early 90s and experimental demonstrations were carried out by several groups around the world. While the scientific community has gained extensive experience on how to perform these experiments, there is still an open question on how to teleport information in a practical way, allowing reliable and fast quantum communication over an extended network.\nIt seems clear that such an infrastructure should be compatible with the current telecommunications network. In addition, the protocol of quantum teleportation requires a final operation to be applied on the teleported qubit, conditioned on the result of the teleportation measurement (transmitted by classical bits), in order to transfer the information faithfully and at a higher rate, a feature called active feed-forward.\nThis means that the receiver requires a device known as a quantum memory that can store the qubit without degrading it until the final operation can be implemented. Finally, this quantum memory should be able to operate in a multiplexed fashion to maximize the speed of teleporting information when the sender and the receiver are far away. To date, no implementation had incorporated these three requirements in the same demonstration.\nIn a recent study published in Nature Communications, ICFO researchers Dario Lago-Rivera, Jelena V. Rakonjac, Samuele Grandi, led by ICREA Prof. at ICFO Hugues de Riedmatten have reported achieving long distance teleportation of quantum information from a photon to a solid-state qubit, a photon stored in a multiplexed quantum memory.\nThe technique involved the use of an active feed-forward scheme, which, together with the multimodality of the memory, has allowed maximization of the teleportation rate. The proposed architecture was compatible with the telecommunications channels, and thus enabling future integration and scalability for long-distance quantum communication.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nHow to achieve quantum teleportation\nThe team built two experimental setups, that in the jargon of the community are usually called Alice and Bob. The two setups were connected by a 1km optical fiber spun up in a spool, to emulate a physical distance between the parties.\nThree photons were involved in the experiment. In the first setup, Alice, the team used a special crystal to create two entangled photons: the first photon at 606 nm, called signal photon, and the second photon called idler photon, compatible with the telecommunications infrastructure.\nOnce created, \"we kept the first 606 nm photon at Alice and stored it in a multiplexed solid-state quantum memory, holding it in the memory for future processing. At the same time, we took the telecom photon created at Alice and sent it through the 1km of optical fiber to reach the second experimental setup, called Bob,\" Dario Lago recalls.\nIn this second setup, Bob, the scientists had another crystal where they created a third photon, where they had encoded the quantum bit they wanted to teleport. Once the third photon was created, the second photon had arrived to Bob from Alice, and this is where the core of the teleportation experiment takes place.\nTeleporting information over 1km \nThe second and third photons interfered with each other through what is known as a Bell State measurement (BSM). The effect of this measurement was to mix the state of the second and third photon. Thanks to the fact that the first and second photons were entangled to begin with, i.e. their joint state was highly correlated, the result of the BSM was that of transferring the information encoded in the third photon to the first one, stored by Alice in the quantum memory, 1 km away.\nAs Dario Lago and Jelena Rakonjac mention, \"we are capable of transferring information between two photons that were never in contact before, but connected through a third photon that was indeed entangled with the first. The uniqueness of this experiment lies in the fact that we employed a multiplexed quantum memory capable of storing the first photon for long enough such that by the time Alice found out that the interaction had happened, we were still able to process the teleported information as the protocol requires.\"\nThis processing that Dario and Jelena mention was the active feed-forward technique mentioned earlier. Depending on the outcome of the BSM, a phase-shift was applied to the first photon after storage in the memory. In this way, the same state would always be encoded in the first photon. Without this, half of the teleportation events would have to be discarded.\nMoreover, the multimodality of the quantum memory allowed them to increase the teleportation rate beyond the limits imposed by the 1 km separation between them without degrading the quality of the teleported qubit. Overall, this resulted in a teleportation rate three times higher than for a single-mode quantum memory, only limited by the speed of the classical hardware.\nScalability and integration\nThe experiment carried out by this group in 2021, where they achieved for the first time entanglement of two multimode quantum memories separated by 10 meters and heralded by a photon at the telecommunication wavelength, has been the precursor of this experiment.\nAs Hugues de Riedmatten emphasizes, \"Quantum teleportation will be crucial for enabling high-quality long-distance communication for the future quantum internet. Our goal is to implement quantum teleportation in more and more complex networks, with previously distributed entanglement. The solid-state and multiplexed nature of our quantum nodes as well as their compatibility with the telecom network make them a promising approach to deploy the technology over long distance in the installed fiber network.\"\nFurther improvements are already being planned. On the one hand, the team is focused on developing and improving the technology in order to extend the setup to much longer distances while maintaining the efficiency and rates. On the other hand, they also aim at studying and using this technique in the transfer of information between different types of quantum nodes, for a future quantum Internet that will be able to distribute and process quantum information between remote parties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDario Lago-Rivera et al, Long distance multiplexed quantum teleportation from a telecom photon to a solid-state qubit, Nature Communications (2023).

   "text": "Ultraviolet (UV) light detection can revolutionize industries such as civil engineering, military defense, aerospace exploration, and medical research. The future of electronics relies heavily on energy-efficient devices that can function independently, which makes the development of photoelectric UV detectors critical. These detectors come in two main types: photoconductive and photovoltaic, each with unique advantages and applications.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotoconductive detectors rely on the changes in the conductivity of semiconductors under UV light, but they require an external power source, which limits their practical application. Photovoltaic detectors ideally convert optical signals into electrical signals without needing an external power supply, but they also have low photoresponsivity, so an external supply is still needed. Additionally, traditional solid-state UV detectors are complex to make and not very convenient or cost-effective.\nNew photoelectrochemical ultraviolet photodetector (PEC UV PD) devices have been developed to detect UV light by using a chemical reaction that generates an electrical signal when exposed to UV light. But most can only detect one type of ultraviolet light.\nAs reported in Advanced Photonics Nexus, researchers from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT) and Nanjing University recently designed a PEC UV PD that can detect two types of ultraviolet light by using a special type of nanostructure made of different layers. This design makes the detector sensitive to changes in the environment, and the researchers were able to further enhance the detector's performance by modifying its surface. This new design offers a promising strategy for developing multifunctional optoelectronic devices.\nThe research team used a layered aluminum gallium nitride (p-AlGaN/GaN) nanostructure as an electrode in a three-electrode system to study how it detects light. They found that tiny semiconductor GaN nanowires are essential in controlling the flow of electrical current and reversing the direction of photocurrent in response to different types of light. They discovered that the nanowires act as a light absorber under 365-nm light while also serving as an electron-donor when exposed to 255-nm light, which helps to regulate photoresponsivity at varying wavelengths.\nThe PEC UV PD design is able to distinguish between different light wavelengths by using layered AlGaN/GaN nanowires instead of bare AlGaN nanowires, achieving photocurrent polarity reversal at two different points. This makes it highly sensitive to changes in the surrounding environment, allowing for easy regulation of photoresponse through light intensity and external bias. Furthermore, by including platinum in the surface modification with the PEC PD, researchers were able to enhance the photoresponse and achieve ultrafast response speeds of 20 ms at 255-nm light.\nAccording to Dunjun Chen, professor of Electronic Science and Engineering and one of the corresponding authors of the work, \"We focused on the importance of the GaN segment in this system and showed how it affects the way the system transports energy.\" Chen adds, \"This self-powered PEC photodetection system offers a new way to understand the transport mechanisms in AlGaN/GaN nanowire PEC systems, which could lead to the development of even more advanced optoelectronic devices in the future.\"\nThis breakthrough highlights the potential for manipulating nanowire construction and surface dynamics to improve the multifunctional performance of PEC PDs and may pave the way for more efficient and effective devices that can be used in a variety of applications.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSaisai Wang et al, Structural designs of AlGaN/GaN nanowire-based photoelectrochemical photodetectors: carrier transport regulation in GaN segment as current flow hub, Advanced Photonics Nexus (2023).

   "text": "Scientists from Skoltech, Moscow Pedagogical State University, and other research centers have discovered a new class of defects in diamond that may be of use for quantum information processing and precise and remote temperature measurements within very small objects, such as living cells. The findings are reported in a letter published in Physical Review B.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nColor centers are an umbrella term for defects of various nature in a transparent crystal, usually diamond. Typically, a color center is a foreign atom, such as nitrogen, incorporated into the crystal lattice of diamond, with one or more nearby carbon atoms missing.\nWhat gives color centers their name are their optical properties. While diamond itself is transparent to visible light, color centers are spots in it that have the technologically appealing capacity to absorb light and effectively re-emit it in a rather narrow spectral band\u2014that is, with a very specific color (wavelength). Importantly, color centers can effectively emit single photons. There are several potential applications where this narrow-band single-photon emission comes in handy.\nSingle photons are building blocks for quantum optics and quantum information applications. For example, such photons are useful for the ultimate data security technology\u2014quantum encryption. It enables secure information transmission between two parties and involves an exchange of encrypted messages and keys to them.\nThe key needs to be transferred over a secure channel, and some quantum key distribution protocols require an effective source of single indistinguishable photons. It means that the parameters of the emitted photons, such as polarization and wavelength, must coincide with a high degree of accuracy.\nAnother exciting property of photon emission from color centers is that the wavelength of the emitted light is sensitive to ambient temperature. This means that photons produced by these defects carry information about the temperature of the environment where the diamond is.\nGiven the fact that scientists can create nanodiamonds with embedded color centers, it is possible to create very small thermometers with a high spatial and temperature resolution. According to the researchers, such temperature sensing would work well in biological applications. In other studies, nanodiamonds have already been introduced into cells to investigate internal temperature variations.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Color centers in diamond have been known and studied for about 40 years. The new variety that we discovered has superior properties as far as potential technological applications go. Namely, the spectral range of emission from our centers is almost 10 times narrower compared with all previously known color centers. The narrow-band emission and the high brightness would make for more sensitive thermometers,\" the lead author of the study, Skoltech Ph.D. student Arthur Neliubov, commented.\nHe added that a further interesting property of the new color centers is narrow-band excitation: They not only emit light in a narrow spectral band, but absorb it selectively as well. In a way, every color center even of the same class is a little different, and there are applications where this could be exploited to elicit response from them in a very targeted fashion.\nAn example would be an analytical technique used in biology known as multicolor imaging, where the \"defective\" microdiamonds could come in handy as nontoxic, nonradioactive, and highly unique biomarkers.\nThe new color centers are so far identified by a set of features on the fluorescence spectra\u2014graphs characterizing the light emitted by the diamond sample. However, the actual nature of these defect centers is yet unknown. The researchers have a couple of guesses but say more research is needed.\n\"We did not introduce any defects on purpose, and yet the color centers reported in our study presented themselves with only slight variations in pure synthetic microdiamonds from three different batches,\" Neliubov said.\n\"The microdiamonds were produced via high-pressure, high-temperature synthesis with the use of an organic compound called adamantane as precursor. It remains to be determined whether these color centers also come up in natural diamonds and in synthetic ones produced by other methods.\"\nThe team's other plans for future research into the newly discovered color centers include investigating their optical properties at very low temperatures. In fact, this might betray what physical defect in the crystal lattice underlies the color center.\nAccording to the team, the discovery has been made possible due to the development of a novel method. The researchers managed to combine two different experimental techniques: scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy.\n\"This enabled us to label the most interesting microdiamonds exhibiting color centers and conduct multiple series of experiments on the same diamonds using different equipment. Also, the high sensitivity of the experimental setup allowed us to zoom in the analysis to the point where we were looking at individual color centers. That's how we could characterize this new class of emitters,\" Neliubov explained.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArthur Yu.

   "text": "In a unique analysis of experimental data, nuclear physicists have made the first-ever observations of how lambda particles, so-called \"strange matter,\" are produced by a specific process called semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS). What's more, these data hint that the building blocks of protons, quarks and gluons, are capable of marching through the atomic nucleus in pairs called diquarks, at least part of the time. These results come from an experiment conducted at the U.S. Department of Energy's Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a result that has been decades in the making. The dataset was originally collected in 2004. Lamiaa El Fassi, now an associate professor of physics at Mississippi State University and principal investigator of the work, first analyzed these data during her thesis project to earn her graduate degree on a different topic.\nNearly a decade after completing her initial research with these data, El Fassi revisited the dataset and led her group through a careful analysis to yield these unprecedented measurements. The dataset comes from experiments in Jefferson Lab's Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF), a DOE user facility. In the experiment, nuclear physicists tracked what happened when electrons from CEBAF scatter off the target nucleus and probe the confined quarks inside protons and neutrons. The results were recently published in Physical Review Letters.\n\"These studies help build a story, analogous to a motion picture, of how the struck quark turns into hadrons. In a new paper, we report first-ever observations of such a study for the lambda baryon in the forward and backward fragmentation regions,\" El Fassi said.\nIn like a lambda, out like a pion \nLike the more familiar protons and neutrons, each lambda is made up of three quarks.\nUnlike protons and neutrons, which only contain a mixture of up and down quarks, lambdas contain one up quark, one down quark and one strange quark. Physicists have dubbed matter that contains strange quarks \"strange matter.\"\nIn this work, El Fassi and her colleagues studied how these particles of strange matter form from collisions of ordinary matter. To do so, they shot CEBAF's electron beam at different targets, including carbon, iron, and lead. When a high-energy electron from CEBAF reaches one of these targets, it breaks apart a proton or neutron inside one of the target's nuclei.\n\"Because the proton or neutron is totally broken apart, there is little doubt that the electron interacts with the quark inside,\" El Fassi said.\nAfter the electron interacts with a quark or quarks via an exchanged virtual photon, the \"struck\" quark(s) begins moving as a free particle in the medium, typically joining up with other quark(s) it encounters to form a new composite particle as they propagate through the nucleus. And some of the time, this composite particle will be a lambda.\nBut the lambda is short-lived\u2014after formation, it will swiftly decay into two other particles: a pion and either a proton or neutron. To measure different properties of these briefly created lambda particles, physicists must detect its two daughter particles, as well as the beam electron that scattered off the target nucleus.\nThe experiment that collected this data, EG2, used the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) detector in Jefferson Lab's Experimental Hall B. These recently published results, \"First Measurement of \u039b Electroproduction off Nuclei in the Current and Target Fragmentation Regions,\" are part of the CLAS collaboration, which involves almost 200 physicists worldwide.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nSIDIS\nThis work is the first to measure the lambda using this process, which is known as semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering, in the forward and backward fragmentation regions. It's more difficult to use this method to study lambda particles, because the particle decays so quickly, it can't be measured directly.\n\"This class of measurement has only been performed on protons before, and on lighter, more stable particles,\" said co-author William Brooks, professor of physics at Federico Santa Mar\u00eda Technical University and co-spokesperson of the EG2 experiment.\nThe analysis was so challenging, it took several years for El Fassi and her group to re-analyze the data and extract these results. It was her thesis advisor, Kawtar Hafidi, who encouraged her to pursue the investigation of the lambda from these datasets.\n\"I would like to commend Lamiaa's hard work and perseverance in dedicating years of her career working on this,\" said Hafidi, associate laboratory director for physical sciences and engineering at Argonne National Lab and co-spokesperson of the EG2 experiment. \"Without her, this work would not have seen fruition.\"\n\"It hasn't been easy,\" El Fassi said. \"It's a long and time-consuming process, but it was worth the effort. When you spend so many years working on something, it feels good to see it published.\"\nEl Fassi began this lambda analysis when she herself was a postdoc, a couple of years prior to becoming an assistant professor at Mississippi State University. Along the way, several of her own postdocs at Mississippi State have helped extract these results, including co-author Taya Chetry.\n\"I'm very happy and motivated to see this work being published,\" said Chetry, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at Florida International University.\nTwo for one \nA notable finding from this intensive analysis changes the way physicists understand how lambdas form in the wake of particle collisions.\nIn similar studies that have used semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering to study other particles, the particles of interest usually form after a single quark was \"struck\" by the virtual photon exchanged between the electron beam and the target nucleus. But the signal left by lambda in the CLAS detector suggests a more packaged deal.\nThe authors' analysis showed that when forming a lambda, the virtual photon has been absorbed part of the time by a pair of quarks, known as a diquark, instead of just one. After being \"struck,\" this diquark went on to find a strange quark and forms a lambda.\n\"This quark pairing suggests a different mechanism of production and interaction than the case of the single quark interaction,\" Hafidi said.\nA better understanding of how different particles form helps physicists in their effort to decipher the strong interaction, the fundamental force that holds these quark-containing particles together. The dynamics of this interaction are very complicated, and so is the theory used to describe it: quantum chromodynamics (QCD).\nComparing measurements to models of QCD's predictions allows physicists to test this theory. Because the diquark finding differs from the model's current predictions, it suggests something about the model is off.\n\"There is an unknown ingredient that we don't understand. This is extremely surprising, since the existing theory can describe essentially all other observations, but not this one,\" Brooks said. \"That means there is something new to learn, and at the moment, we have no clue what it could be.\"\nTo find out, they'll need even more measurements.\nData for EG2 were collected with 5.014 GeV (billion electron-volt) electron beams in the CEBAF's 6 GeV era. Future experiments will use electron beams from the updated CEBAF, which now extend up to 11 GeV for Experimental Hall B, as well as an updated CLAS detector known as CLAS12, to continue studying the formation of a variety of particles, including lambdas, with higher-energy electrons.\nThe upcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at DOE's Brookhaven National Laboratory will also provide a new opportunity to continue studying this strange matter and quark pairing structure of the nucleon with greater precision.\n\"These results lay the groundwork for upcoming studies at the upcoming CLAS12 and the planned EIC experiments, where one can investigate the diquark scattering in greater detail,\" Chetry said.\nEl Fassi is also a co-spokesperson for CLAS12 measurements of quark propagation and hadron formation. When data from the new experiments is finally ready, physicists will compare it to QCD predictions to further refine this theory.\n\"Any new measurement that will give novel information toward understanding the dynamics of strong interactions is very important,\" she said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tT.

A better theoretical understanding of quantum effects in crystals and the development of advanced experimental tools to probe and measure them has revealed a whole host of exotic states of matter.\nA prominent example of this is the topological insulator: a kind of crystalline solid that exhibits wildly different properties on their surfaces than in the rest of the material. The best-known manifestation of this is that topological insulators conduct electricity on their surfaces but are insulating in their interiors.\nAnother manifestation is the so-called quantum anomalous Hall effect.\nKnown for more than a century, the conventional Hall effect arises when an electric current flowing through a conductor is deflected from a straight line by a magnetic field applied at right angles to the current. This deflection produces a voltage across the conductor (and a corresponding electrical resistance).\nIn some magnetic materials, this phenomenon can arise even when a magnetic field is not applied, which is called the anomalous Hall effect.\n\"The anomalous Hall resistance can become very large in topological insulators,\" explains Minoru Kawamura of the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science. \"At low temperatures, the anomalous Hall resistance increases and reaches a fundamental value, while the resistance along the current direction becomes zero.\" This is the quantum anomalous Hall effect, and it was first observed in the lab nearly a decade ago.\nNow, Kawamura and his colleagues have demonstrated an effect known as Laughlin charge pumping in a quantum anomalous Hall insulator.\nThe team fabricated a donut-shaped disk made of layers of different magnetic topological insulators. They then measured how the electric current through the device responded to an alternating magnetic field generated by metal electrodes on the inner and outer curves of the donut.\nThe researchers observed that this field led to electric charge accumulating at the ends of the cylinder. This is Laughlin charge pumping.\nPrevious demonstrations of quantum anomalous Hall insulators used rectangular devices that included edges connecting the electrodes. And it was thought that electronic states in these edges were crucial for supporting the quantum anomalous Hall insulator.\nBut the team's finding overturns this assumption. \"Our demonstration of Laughlin charge pumping in a quantum anomalous Hall insulator uses a disk-shaped device without edge channels connecting the two electrodes,\" says Kawamura. \"Our result raises the possibility that other exciting electronic phenomena can be realized in quantum anomalous Hall materials.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMinoru Kawamura et al, Laughlin charge pumping in a quantum anomalous Hall insulator, Nature Physics (2023).

   "text": "For two decades, it was believed that a possible quantum spin liquid was discovered in a synthetically produced material. In this case, it would not follow the laws of classical physics even on a macroscopic level, but rather those of the quantum world. There is great hope in these materials: they would be suitable for applications in quantum entangled information transmission (quantum cryptography) or even quantum computation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, however, researchers from TU Wien and Toho University in Japan have shown that the promising material, \u03ba-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu2(CN)3, is not the predicted quantum spin liquid, but a material that can be described using known concepts.\nIn their recent publication in the journal Nature Communications, the researchers report how they investigated the mysterious quantum state by measuring the electrical resistance in \u03ba-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu2(CN)3 as a function of temperature and pressure. In 2021, Andrej Pustogow from the Institute of Solid State Physics at TU Wien has already investigated the magnetic properties of this material.\nPhase diagrams illustrate material properties\n\"Phase diagrams are the language of physics,\" says Pustogow, leading author of the current study. If you understand this language, a quick glance at the diagram shows how the properties of a material change depending on temperature and pressure. Water, for example, becomes solid at a temperature of 0\u00b0C and gaseous at 100\u00b0C. If you now change the pressure, for example by heating water in a pressure cooker, the boiling point increases to over 100\u00b0C.\nIn order to now find out how the supposed quantum spin liquid\u2014i.e., a liquid in which the spins of the electrons can rotate freely and are quantum entangled\u2014behaves under pressure, the research team carried out systematic resistance measurements. \"The special thing is that the very shape of the phase boundary gives deep insights into the physics of magnetic quantum fluctuations, which actually can't be measured with electrical resistance per se,\" says Pustogow. This was only made possible by a method that is unique worldwide, which the Japanese partners used to study the material. \"So we make the impossible possible and follow the entropy footprints of the magnetic moments and thus gain new insights into a supposed quantum spin fluid,\" continues Pustogow.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Prof. Andrej Pustogow. Credit: Vienna University of Technology\n             \n\n\nDisorder as a key\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers also found that the phase diagram of \u03ba-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu2(CN)3 strongly resembles that of helium-3. Already back in the 1950s a Soviet researcher predicted that helium-3 behaves differently from conventional materials, turning from solid to liquid rather than from liquid to solid at low temperatures (of less than 0.3 Kelvin). Exactly the same effect occurs with electrons in solids when they freeze upon increasing temperature from a metallic state (mobile electrons) to a Mott insulator, in which the electrons are firmly bound to the atom and do not move.\nThis \"Pomeranchuk effect,\" named after the researcher who predicted it, was also observed by the international research team in \u03ba-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu2(CN)3: At higher temperatures, the material initially shows insulating behavior with rigid electrons that melt into a liquid (metal) when it cools. Below 6 Kelvin, however, the electrons freeze again and lose their magnetic moments as well.\n\"Although \u03ba-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu2(CN)3 itself is not a quantum spin liquid, our research provides important clues for further research into these materials. For example, our experiments help to better understand the mechanism of magnetoelastic coupling. If we succeed in controlling this effect, we may also be able to eventually realize a quantum spin liquid,\" Pustogow says.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA.

They exhibit both solid and superfluid properties simultaneously. In 2019, three research groups were able to demonstrate this state for the first time beyond doubt in ultracold quantum gases, among them the research group led by Francesca Ferlaino from the Department of Experimental Physics at the University of Innsbruck and the \u00d6AW Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI) in Innsbruck.\nIn 2021, Francesca Ferlaino's team studied in detail the life cycle of supersolid states in a dipolar gas of dysprosium atoms. They observed something unexpected: \"Our data suggested that an increase in temperature promotes the formation of supersolid structures,\" recounts Claudia Politi of Francesca Ferlaino's team. \"This surprising behavior was an important boost to theory, which had previously paid little attention to thermal fluctuations in this context.\"\nThe Innsbruck scientists joined forces with the Danish theoretical group led by Thomas Pohl to explore the effect of thermal fluctuation. They developed and published in Nature Communications a theoretical model that can explain the experimental results and underlines the thesis that heating the quantum liquid can lead to the formation of a quantum crystal. The theoretical model shows that as the temperature rises, these structures can form more easily.\n\"With the new model, we now have a phase diagram for the first time that shows the formation of a supersolid state as a function of temperature,\" Francesca Ferlaino says. \"The surprising behavior, which contradicts our everyday observation, arises from the anisotropic nature of the dipole-dipole interaction of the strongly magnetic atoms of dysprosium.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJ.

   "text": "Perturbing electron spins in a magnet usually results in excitations called \"spin waves\" that ripple through the magnet like waves on a pond that's been struck by a pebble. In a new study, Rice University physicists and their collaborators have discovered dramatically different excitations called \"spin excitons\" that can also \"ripple\" through a nickel-based magnet as a coherent wave.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a study published in Nature Communications, the researchers reported finding unusual properties in nickel molybdate, a layered magnetic crystal. Subatomic particles called electrons resemble miniscule magnets, and they typically orient themselves like compass needles in relation to magnetic fields. In experiments where neutrons were scattered from magnetic nickel ions inside the crystals, the researchers found that two outermost electrons from each nickel ion behaved differently. Rather than aligning their spins like compass needles, the two canceled one another in a phenomenon physicists call a spin singlet.\n\"Such a substance should not be a magnet at all,\" said Rice's Pengcheng Dai, corresponding author of the study. \"And if a neutron scatters off a given nickel ion, the excitations should remain local and not propagate through the sample.\"\nDai and his collaborators were therefore surprised when instruments in the neutron-scattering experiments detected not one, but two families of propagating waves, each at dramatically different energies.\nTo understand the waves' origins, it was necessary to delve into the atomic details of the magnetic crystals. For instance, electromagnetic forces from atoms in crystals can compete with the magnetic field and affect electrons inside neighboring atoms. This is called the crystal field effect, and it can force electron spins to orient themselves along directions distinct from the orientation of the magnetic field. Probing crystal field effects in the nickel molybdate crystals required additional experiments and theoretical interpretation of the data from the experiments.\n\"The collaboration between experimental groups and theory is paramount to painting a full picture and understanding the unusual spin excitations observed in this compound,\" said Rice co-author Emilia Morosan.\nMorosan's group probed the thermal response of the crystals to changes in temperature using specific heat measurements. From those experiments, the researchers concluded that two kinds of crystal field environments occurred in the layered nickel molybdate, and the two affected nickel ions very differently.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"In one, the field effect is rather weak and corresponds to a thermal energy of about 10 Kelvin,\" said study co-author Andriy Nevidomskyy, a theoretical physicist at Rice who helped interpret the experimental data. \"It is perhaps not surprising to see, at few-Kelvin temperatures, that neutrons can excite magnetic spin waves from nickel atoms that are subject to this first type of crystal field effect. But it is most puzzling to see them coming from nickel atoms that are subject to the second type. Those atoms have a tetrahedral arrangement of oxygens around them, and the electric field effect is nearly 20-fold stronger, meaning the excitations are that much harder to create.\"\nNevidomskyy said this can be understood as if the spins on the corresponding nickel ions had different \"mass.\"\n\"The analogy is that of heavy basketballs that are intermixed with tennis balls,\" he said. \"To excite the spins of the second type, the heavier basketballs, one must administer a stronger 'kick' by shining more energetic neutrons at the material.\"\nThe resulting effect on the nickel spin is called a spin exciton, and one would normally expect the effect of the exciton-producing \"kick\" to be confined to a single atom. But measurements from the experiments indicated \"basketballs\" were moving in unison, creating an unexpected sort of wave. Even more surprising, the waves appeared to persist at relatively high temperatures where the crystals no longer behaved as magnets.\nThe explanation offered by Nevidomskyy and theorist co-author Leon Balents from the University of California, Santa Barbara was that heavier spin excitons\u2014basketballs in the analogy\u2014bob in response to the fluctuations of the surrounding, lighter magnetic excitons\u2014the analogous tennis balls\u2014and if the interactions between the two types of balls are sufficiently strong, the heavier spin excitons participate in a coherent motion akin to a wave.\n\"What is particularly interesting,\" Dai said, \"is that the two kinds of nickel atoms each form a triangular lattice, and the magnetic interactions within this lattice are therefore frustrated.\"\nIn magnetism on triangular lattices, frustration refers to the difficulty in aligning all the magnetic moments anti-parallel (up-down) with respect to their three immediate, nearest neighbors.\nUnderstanding the role of magnetic frustrations in triangular lattices is one of the long-standing challenges that Dai and Nevidomskyy have both been working to address for a number of years.\n\"It is very exciting to find a puzzle, against one's expectations, and then feel a sense of satisfaction of having understood its origin,\" said Nevidomskyy.\nDai, Morosan and Nevidomskyy are members of the Rice Quantum Initiative. Dai is the Sam and Helen Worden Professor of Physics and Astronomy. Morosan is a professor of physics and astronomy, and of chemistry. Nevidomskyy is an associate professor of physics and astronomy. The neutron scattering experiments were carried out by Bin Gao and Tong Chen in Dai's group in collaboration with instrument scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and ISIS Neutron and Muon Source at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.

All these characteristics are required for real-world applications such as quantum processors,\" says Prof. Dr. Michael Kues, head of the Institute of Photonics, and board member of the Cluster of Excellence PhoenixD at Leibniz University Hannover.\nQuantum bits (qubits) are the basic building blocks of quantum computers and the quantum internet. Quantum light sources generate light quanta (photons) that can be used as quantum bits. On-chip photonics has become a leading platform for processing optical quantum states as it is compact, robust, and allows to accommodate and arrange many elements on a single chip. Here, light is directed on the chip through extremely compact structures, which are used to build photonic quantum computing systems. These are already accessible today through the cloud. Scalably implemented, they could solve tasks that are inaccessible to conventional computers due to their limited computing capacities. This superiority is referred to as quantum advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\n                The whole quantum light source fits on a chip smaller than a one-euro coin. The researchers reduced the size of the light source by a factor of more than 1,000 by using a novel \"hybrid technology\" that combines a laser made of indium phosphide and a filter made of silicon nitride on a single chip. The new light source is efficient and stable and can find applications to drive quantum computers or the quantum internet.

However, we overcome these challenges through a novel chip design and by exploiting different integrated platforms,\" says Hatam Mahmudlu, a Ph.D. student in Kues's team. Their new development, an electrically-excited, laser-integrated photonic quantum light source, fits entirely on a chip and can emit frequency-entangled qubit states.\n\"Qubits are very susceptible to noise. The chip must be driven by the laser field, completely free from noise, requiring an on-chip filter. Previously, it was a major challenge to integrate laser, filter, and a cavity on the same chip as there was no unique material that was efficient to build these different components,\" says Dr. Raktim Haldar, a Humboldt fellow in Kues's group.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe key was the \"hybrid technology\" that combines the laser made of indium phosphide, a filter, and a cavity made of silicon nitride and brings them together into a single chip. On the chip, in a spontaneous nonlinear process, two photons are created from a laser field. Each photon spans a range of colors simultaneously, which is called \"superposition,\" and the colors of both photons are correlated, i.e., the photons are entangled and can store quantum information. \"We achieve remarkable efficiencies and state qualities required for application in quantum computers or the quantum internet,\" says Kues.\n\n\n\n\n\n                They developed the new integrated quantum light source (from left): Prof. Dr Michael Kues, head of the Institute of Photonics and board member of the Cluster of Excellence PhoenixD at Leibniz University Hannover, with doctoral student Hatam Mahmudlu and Humboldt fellow Dr. Raktim Haldar.

Unlike Google, which currently uses super-cold qubits in cryogenic systems, the quantum advantage could be achieved with such photonic systems on a chip even at room temperature,\" says Haldar.\nThe scientists also expect their discovery to help lower the production costs of applications. \"We can imagine that our quantum light source will soon be a fundamental component of programmable photonic quantum processors,\" says Kues.\nProf. Dr. Michael Kues is head of the Institute of Photonics and a board member of the Cluster of Excellence PhoenixD: Photonics, Optics, and Engineering\u2014Innovation across Disciplines at Leibniz University Hannover, Germany.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRaktim Haldar, Fully on-chip photonic turnkey quantum source for entangled qubit/qudit state generation, Nature Photonics (2023).

   "text": "Scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory have discovered new details about the electrons in a nickel-based family of superconducting materials. The research, described in two papers published in Physical Review X, reveals that these nickel-based materials have certain similarities with\u2014and key differences from\u2014copper-based superconductors. Comparing the two kinds of \"high-temperature\" superconductors may help scientists zero in on key features essential for these materials' remarkable ability to carry electrical current without losing energy as heat.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The quest to understand high-temperature superconductors is a decades-old challenge,\" said Mark Dean of Brookhaven Lab's Condensed Matter Physics & Materials Science Department, who led the research described in both papers. Ever since copper-based, or cuprate, superconductors were discovered in the 1980s, scientists have been trying to understand what makes them tick.\nThe interest is driven in large part by their potential for energy-saving applications. Picture power lines that deliver electricity to homes far from wind and solar farms without losing a speck of energy, and computers and other devices that function flawlessly without the need for expensive and energy-intensive cooling.\nTrouble is, despite their \"high-temperature\" moniker, cuprate superconductors themselves must be kept extremely cold to operate\u2014well below zero degrees Fahrenheit. Discovering what allows electrons in these materials to overcome their normal \"like-charge\" repulsion and flow with no resistance could perhaps point the way to superconductors that operate in closer to real-world conditions.\n\"These materials are also a testbed for efforts to understand other quantum materials where electrons interact very strongly,\" said Steven Johnston, a theorist at the University of Tennessee and a co-author of the paper. \"You could make a reasonable argument that this is the most important open problem in the physics of materials.\"\nNickel analogs\nAs part of the quest to crack the case on cuprates, scientists have looked for analogs\u2014similar superconducting compounds they could study and compare to give them clues for improving properties.\n\"Maybe, if you just tweak something, you can make a property such as the temperature of the transition to superconductivity higher, or you can make materials with cheaper elements for applications,\" said Yao Shen, a postdoctoral researcher at Brookhaven and first author of the publications.\nNickel was a logical choice. Its proximity to copper on the periodic table implies that compounds made from these next-door-neighbor transition metals might operate in similar ways but with enough differences to point out what is essential to superconductivity.\nBut even before scientists at Stanford University successfully created a nickel-based superconductor in 2019, others wondered whether the nickel compounds could be considered true analogs to cuprates. Once the nickelates were synthesized, the quest to find out began.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n'Seeing' electronic behavior\nThese studies used X-rays at Brookhaven Lab's National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II), a DOE Office of Science user facility that enables research on the microscopic structure, chemistry, and other properties of all sorts of materials. The team used the Soft Inelastic X-Ray (SIX) beamline, run by study collaborators Valentina Bisogni and Jonathan Pelliciari, to compare the electronic properties of a layered nickelate superconductor (La4Ni3O8) with those of a well-known cuprate (La2\u2212xSrxCuO4).\nThey wanted to know which electrons (from which elements) in each compound contribute to superconductivity and other electronic properties, including the presence of a \"charge-density wave.\" This ordered pattern of electrons might play a role in generating the material's superconductivity.\n\"Scientists have evidence that superconductivity in cuprates is associated with very strong magnetic interactions between the copper ions,\" said Michael Norman, a collaborating scientist from Argonne National Laboratory. \"So, in addition to comparing the electrons involved in superconductivity in these two materials, we also wanted to look for evidence of magnetic interactions between the nickel ions in these nickelates and understand which elements contribute electrons that form both the charge and magnetic density waves in these materials.\"\nThe SIX beamline, with its world-leading energy resolution, allows the scientists to \"see\" these subatomic scale details by tuning the X-ray energy precisely to the individual elements in the sample using a technique called resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS).\n\"We can tune our X-ray energy to resonate with either the oxygen or nickel or other elements and then we can see the electronic properties of those specific elements,\" Dean said. \"We used that alongside theory calculations to get a detailed picture of how these materials work electronically.\"\nKey similarities and differences\nThe findings indicate substantial similarities between the nickelate and cuprate superconductors\u2014and some differences.\nFor example, the scientists found that in both sets of materials, the transition metal (copper or nickel) and oxygen both contribute to the materials' electronic properties, but the magnetic interactions among nickel atoms, mediated by intervening oxygens, are slightly weaker than the oxygen-mediated magnetic interactions among copper atoms in the cuprates.\n\"Cuprates have this very nice well-aligned energy between the copper and the oxygen, and that's why they are very strongly magnetic,\" Shen said. \"A similar thing happens in the nickel compounds just to a slightly less perfect extent.\"\nThe scientists found some key differences in the electronic properties that contribute to the generation of charge order\u2014the charge density wave\u2014in the two classes of superconductors. It turns out that the charge density wave in the nickelate is much more complex than that of the cuprate, coming from the combined interactions of all the different elements in the material.\n\"These findings indicate that the nickel compounds are promising to learn more about how the cuprates work, and they indicate the different ways you might want to change the nickel compounds to make them more like the cuprates\u2014to have stronger magnetism or stronger superconductivity,\" said Jennifer Sears, a postdoctoral researcher at Brookhaven.\n\"X-rays are really showing their power in probing these types of problems. The capabilities at NSLS-II have made it possible for us to work out this physics quite quickly in a way that wouldn't have been the case without this new generation of RIXS instruments,\" noted collaborator Matteo Mitrano of Harvard University.\nNext steps include exploring the contributions of the rare-earth elements\u2014lanthanum, strontium, and others\u2014to the properties of these materials.\n\"The rare earth layer is not thought to be electronically active in the cuprates, but that's an open question in the nickel-based materials,\" Dean said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tY.

   "text": "Physicists and material scientists have been trying to metallize hydrogen for many decades, but they have not yet succeeded. In 1968, British physicist Neil Ashcroft predicted that atomic metallic hydrogen would be a high-temperature semiconductor.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost recent studies also suggested that this elusive and hypothetical form of hydrogen would also conduct electricity with no resistance when its temperature exceeds that of boiling water. This prediction ultimately paved the way for the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in hydrides (i.e., compounds containing hydrogen and a metal).\nResearchers at Sapienza University of Rome, Sorbonne University, CNRS, and the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA) have recently carried out a study aimed at thoroughly characterizing the behavior and properties of hydrogen at high pressures. Their paper, published in Nature Physics, outlines a highly accurate phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen, which could inform ongoing efforts aimed at creating atomic metallic hydrogen.\n\"The most advanced laboratories worldwide are trying to synthesize stable atomic metallic hydrogen by compressing hydrogen molecules into diamond anvil cells up to pressures millions of times higher than the atmospheric one,\" Lorenzo Monacelli, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org. \"However, the H2 covalent bond is one of the strongest in chemistry, and the pressure required to push hydrogen nuclei close enough to break the molecular bond is far higher than expected. \"Our work rationalizes the latest experimental findings and reports the most accurate determination of the high-pressure hydrogen phase diagram.\"\nReliably studying the behavior and properties of hydrogen at high pressures is a challenging task, as the necessary experiments are difficult to perform, while standard simulation tools often yield unreliable results. Monacelli and his colleagues used advanced computational tools to create a phase diagram of hydrogen and deuterium at low temperatures and high pressures.\n\"At such high pressure, many different molecular phases are stable,\" Michele Casula, another researcher involved in this study, explained. \"It is paradoxical and fascinating to discover how complex the phase diagram is despite the simplicity of its elementary brick, made of a proton and an electron only. In some sense, it is a particularly significant example of Phill Anderson's famous motto: 'More is different.'\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nSolid hydrogen is fully comprised of free electrons and protons that interact with each other. A crucial challenge when trying to simulate hydrogen is that the quantum behavior of these two types of particles creates complex interactions.\n\"The quantum behavior of electrons and protons is different, as each proton weighs about 2,000 times the electron,\" Casula said. \"In our work, we employed the 'best' method to solve the electronic problem (i.e., quantum Monte Carlo simulations) and the best approach to solve the proton quantum effects, namely the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation.\"\nUsing these state-of-the-art computational techniques, the researchers were able to create one of the most accurate phase diagrams of high-pressure hydrogen to date. Specifically, they showed that the experimentally elusive atomic metallic hydrogen phase should form at 577(4) GPa, after another stage in which molecular hydrogen transitions from one metallic phase (referred to as phase III) to another phase in which the hydrogen is metallic and still molecular (phase VI).\n\"The comprehensive characterization of this material at ultra-high pressures provided by our work suggests that the atomic phase, supposed to be a room-temperature superconductor, must be searched experimentally at much higher pressures than previously suggested,\" Casula explained. \"Moreover, our study allowed the interpretation of recent experimental results in apparent contradiction, as researchers can indirectly probe the crystal structure at such high pressures.\"\nThe new phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen computed by this team of researchers suggests that hydrogen starts acquiring metallic properties progressively as the pressure rises. It also shows why previous experiments may have been unsuccessful in attaining atomic metallic hydrogen, namely because the pressures tested in experiments were not high enough.\nIn their paper, Monacelli, Casula and their colleagues also present a complete and exhaustive spectroscopic characterization of hydrogen. Together with the phase diagram they created, this characterization could inform future research efforts aimed at observing hydrogen in its atomic metallic phase.\n\"Notably, we predicted a clearcut isotope shift for the transition pressures, measured and confirmed very recently,\" Monacelli added. \"We are now focusing on studying the superconductive properties of hydrogen at high pressure. This problem is exciting and presents critical challenges, as the current theory of superconductivity based on the interaction between lattice vibrations (phonons) and electrons misses some crucial aspects present in hydrogen and hydrides.\"\nMonacelli and Casula pointed out that the current theory of superconductivity does not account for strong anharmonic propagations of phonons, the nonlinear coupling between phonons and electrons, and the dynamic interplay between electrons and fast nuclei (i.e., the \"adiabatic\" approximation). In collaboration with their colleagues, they aim at devising a new theory that collectively considers all these phenomena. In addition, the researchers are now planning to create detailed characterizations of other superconductive hydrides using the same computational tools employed in their recent study.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLorenzo Monacelli et al, Quantum phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen, Nature Physics (2023).

   "text": "Perovskite lasers have rapidly achieved progress in developing continuous-wave excited lasing from a femtosecond pulse excited lasing, which is considered a critical step towards electrically excited lasing. After continuous-wave lasing at room temperature, the next goal is to realize electrically driven lasing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn commercially available electric injection lasers, traditional epitaxial grown single crystal semiconductors with both large thermal conductivity \u03ba and high charge carrier mobility m usually exhibit small resistive heating under large current flow. While perovskites possess large and balanced charge carrier mobilities, they suffer from small \u03ba values. The thermal conductivity of MAPbI3 is 1-3 W m\u22121 K\u22121, which is inferior to that of GaAs (50 W m\u22121 K\u22121).\nHence, heat converted from energy loss through nonradiative pathways cannot be effectively dissipated. This failure will increase the lasing threshold as carriers occupy a broader energy range at a higher temperature, diluting the population inversion of any given transition along with other problems such as degradation and heat-induced defects.\nThe lowest electric excitation threshold of a distributed-feedback (DFB) perovskite laser would be as high as 24 mA cm\u22122. Moreover, owing to high current injection in conventional perovskite light-emitting diode architectures used for laser devices, the external quantum efficiency would be significantly restricted under high current injection conditions owing to Joule heating. Hence, heat management is a bottleneck for developing perovskite-based electrically driven lasers.\nIn this light, a group of researchers, including Prof. Guohui Li, Prof. Shengwang Yu, Prof.  Yanxia Cui of Taiyuan University of Technology, and Prof. Kaibo Zheng of Lund University, demonstrated a perovskite nanoplatelet laser on a diamond substrate that can efficiently dissipate heat generated during optical pumping.\nThe demonstrated laser features a Q factor of ~1962, a lasing threshold of 52.19 \u03bcJ cm\u22122. Tight optical confinement is also realized by introducing a thin SiO2 gap layer between nanoplatelets and the diamond substrate. Electric field distributions inside the structures shows that a wide SiO2 gap of 200 nm in thickness produces evidently less leakage field in the diamond substrate, simultaneously proposing better mode confinement within the MAPbI3 nanoplatelet.\nThey evaluated the heat dissipation in perovskite nanoplatelet lasers on the diamond substrate by temperature variations under optical pumping conditions. The laser features a low pump-density-dependent temperature sensitivity (~0.56 \u00b1 0.01 K cm2 \u03bcJ\u22121) through the incorporation of the diamond substrate.\nThe sensitivity is one to two orders of magnitude lower than the values for previously reported perovskite nanowire lasers on glass substrates. The high-thermal-conductivity diamond substrate enables the nanoplatelet laser to operate at a high pump density. The study could inspire the development of electrically driven perovskite lasers.

   "text": "To study atomic nuclei and subatomic particles, scientists use the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to collide heavy ions\u2014atomic nuclei completely stripped of their surrounding electrons. In these collisions, the quarks and gluons that normally make up nucleons (protons and neutrons) melt into a new state of matter called a quark-gluon plasma (QGP).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo figure out the properties of this QGP, theorists compare a sophisticated model to a large amount of experimental data. One of the parameters in this model is the size of the nucleons inside the two colliding lead nuclei. However, to reach agreement with the reaction rate, nucleons must be smaller than scientists had expected based on previous analyses.\nLow-energy experiments find a nucleon size of around 0.5 femtometer (fm), or about 5x10-16 meters. Heavy ion collisions provide a fundamentally different perspective on the nucleon size compared to these low-energy experiments. Previous analyses of heavy ion experimental data have found a much larger nucleon size, of about 1 fm.\nThe new analysis includes for the first time the experimentally measured reaction rate of lead-lead collisions. The reaction rate is the frequency with which atomic nuclei react with each other, and it is determined by the density of nuclei in the beam as well as the size of the nuclei. After including this reaction rate, the preferred size is around 0.6 fm, resolving the discrepancy.\nThe total hadronic cross section of lead-lead collisions tells scientists the collision rate for given beam density. The cross section is very easy to compute in a theoretical model, making it a good candidate for comparison to experiments in a global analysis. However, the experimental measurement is more difficult to perform. As a result, until the year 2021 scientific uncertainties on this quantity were large.\nIn 2022, a new measurement from A Large Ion Collision Experiment (ALICE) at the LHC reduced these uncertainties substantially, allowing for its inclusion in a global analysis. This analysis, performed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and CERN, compares a theoretical calculation to more than 600 individual experimental data points.\nThe analysis found that when not including the cross-section measurement, nucleon sizes of around 1 fm are preferred. However, when the cross section is included, this preferred value decreases to around 0.6 fm.\nThe findings are published in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGovert Nijs et al, Hadronic Nucleus-Nucleus Cross Section and the Nucleon Size, Physical Review Letters (2022).

   "text": "The QCD vacuum (i.e., the ground state of vacuum in the quantum chromodynamics regime) is theoretically characterized by the presence of non-zero expectation values of condensates, such as gluons and quark\u2013antiquark pairs. Instead of being associated with a lack of particles and interactions in an empty space, physics theory regards this state as filled with the so-called condensates, which have the same quantum numbers as the vacuum and cannot be directly observed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile many theoretical physicists have discussed the properties of the QCD vacuum, experimentally validating these theoretical predictions has so far proved challenging, simply because the condensates in this state are elusive and cannot be directly detected. A hint of experimental \"observation\" can be found in the theoretical predictions of the properties of the QCD vacuum.\nTheories predict that the condensate may decrease in the high temperature and/or at a high matter density due to the partial restoration of the so-called chiral symmetry. To prove these theories, some researchers collected measurements during ultra-relativistic, head-on collisions of heavy ions at particularly high temperatures. Other efforts in this area tried to probe properties of the QCD vacuum by measuring so-called \"medium effects.\" These are essentially effects that alter the QCD vacuum and its structure, prompted by the presence of high matter density such as nuclear matter.\nResearchers at the RIKEN Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science, Nara Women's University, the German Heavy Ion Research Institute, and other institutes worldwide have recently set out to gather experimental insights of the medium effects in nuclei at lower temperatures. In their experiments, outlined in a Nature Physics paper, they used spectroscopy techniques to measure the states of in (Sn) pionic atoms, bound systems consisting of a pion and atomic nucleus.\n\"The existence of the hidden structure of vacuum is one of the most important physics questions of the modern era,\" Kenta Itahashi, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org. \"The 'non-trivial' structure of the vacuum has been theoretically discussed for a long time. For instance, Nambu described the spontaneous symmetry breakdown of the vacuum. Despite the many related theories, experimental evidence in this area has so far been limited.\"\nThe primary objective of the recent work by Itahashi and his colleagues was to further elucidate the hidden structure of the QCD vacuum and its evolution over the history of the universe. According to theoretical predictions, the condensation of quark\u2013antiquark pairs (i.e., chiral condensates) in this vacuum state would break the vacuum's chiral symmetry.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nAt high temperatures and/or high matter densities the chiral symmetry would be partially restored, which should thus theoretically reduce the expected value of chiral condensates. In their new experiments, the team set out to deduce the expected value of quark\u2013antiquark pairs in the QCD vacuum by measuring pionic atoms at high densities and lower temperatures with high-precision spectroscopy techniques.\n\"We measured pion-nuclear bound systems in a spectroscopic way\" Itahashi explained. \"Our spectroscopy thus provides complementary information that can be analyzed in conjunction with past experimental findings focusing head-on collisions. Like drawing a phase diagram of water or superconducting materials, we wished to draw a phase diagram of the vacuum on a plane of temperature and density. In a sense, nuclear matter behaves as an impurity loaded into the vacuum.\"\nThe researchers found that their measurements were consistent with the spontaneous breakdown of the QCD vacuum's chiral symmetry described by Nambu's theory. Combined with the results of a pioneering study they conducted almost two decades ago, this work advances the present understanding of the QCD vacuum, the breaking and restoration of chiral symmetry, and how this affects the expected value of chiral condensates at high temperatures and/or high matter densities.\n\"As far as we know, there is currently no information on the order parameter at a high-matter density that was as accurately determined as ours,\" Itahashi said. \"In our next studies, we wish to investigate the density dependence of the chiral symmetry. We already plotted the first point of the chiral order parameter on the density axis and we now plan to study the density derivative by making a systematic measurement. In addition, we also wish to develop a new pionic atom spectroscopy technique to reach higher precision and to enable the study of pionic atom formation with radioisotopes.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTakahiro Nishi et al, Chiral symmetry restoration at high matter density observed in pionic atoms, Nature Physics (2023).

   "text": "Photovoltaics, the conversion of light to electricity, is a key technology for sustainable energy. Since the days of Max Planck and Albert Einstein, we know that light as well as electricity come in tiny, quantized packets called photons and elementary charges, the latter represented by electrons and holes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome materials convert photons into more free charges than would be expected. Using an ultrafast film, researchers have now been able to get a picture of this process. Their findings have been published in the journal Nature.\nBetter solar cells thanks to exciton splitting\nIn a usual solar cell, the energy of a single photon is transferred to two free charges in the material, but no more than that. However, a few molecular materials like pentacene are an exception and show conversion of one photon into four charges, instead. This excitation doubling, which is called exciton fission, could be extremely useful for high-efficiency photovoltaics, specifically to upgrade the dominant silicon-based technologies.\nA team of researchers at the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society, the Technical University of Berlin, and the Julius-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrzburg have now deciphered the first step of this process by recording an ultrafast movie of the photon-to-electricity conversion process, resolving a decades-old debate about the mechanism of the process.\n\"When pentacene is excited by light, the charges in the material rapidly react,\" explains Prof. Ralph Ernstorfer, a senior author of the study. \"It was an open and highly disputed question whether an absorbed photon excites two electrons and holes directly or initially just one electron-hole pair, which subsequently shares its energy with another charge pair.\" Ernstorfer is head of a Max Planck research group at the Fritz Haber Institute and Professor of Experimental Physics at the Technical University of Berlin.\nSnapshots of one billionth of a millionth of a second\nTo unravel this mystery the researchers used time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, a cutting-edge technique to observe the dynamics of electrons on the femtosecond time scale, which is a billionth of a millionth of a second. This ultrafast electron movie camera enabled them to capture images of the fleeting excited electrons for the first time.\n\"Seeing these charge carrier pairs was crucial to decipher the process,\" says Alexander Neef, from the Fritz Haber Institute and the first author of the study. \"An excited electron-hole pair not only has a specific energy but also adapts distinct patterns, which are called orbitals. To understand the process of singlet fission it is such essential to identify the orbital shapes of the charge carriers and how these change over time.\"\nCrucial for the use of organic semiconductors\nWith the images from the ultrafast electron movie at hand, the researchers decomposed the dynamics of the excited charge carriers for the first time based on their orbital characteristics. \"We can now say with certainty that only one electron-hole pair is excited immediately after photon excitation and identified the mechanism of the free charge carrier-doubling process,\" adds Alexander Neef.\n\"Resolving this initial step in exciton fission is essential to successfully implement this class of organic semiconductors in innovative photovoltaic applications and, thus, to further boost the conversion efficiency of today's solar-cells,\" states Prof. Jens Pflaum, whose group at the University of W\u00fcrzburg has provided the high quality molecular crystals for this study. Such an advance will have enormous impacts as solar energy and its generation by these third-generation cells will be a dominant energy source of the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlexander Neef et al, Orbital-resolved observation of singlet fission, Nature (2023).

   "text": "The universe began about 14 billion years ago with a single point that contained a vast array of fundamental particles, according to the prevailing theory known as the Big Bang. Under the pressure of extreme heat and energy, the point inflated and then expanded to become the universe as we know it. That expansion continues to this day.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlocking the mysteries of what happened in that first instant is a key subject of nuclear physics research. Rosi Reed, associate professor, and Anders Knospe, assistant professor\u2015both in the Department of Physics\u2015are on the leading edge of that research, probing the nature of that initial matter created, quark-gluon plasma, a fluid made up of subatomic particles. With support from the National Science Foundation, they have built a highly-specialized detector to measure aspects of the universe that have never before been measured.\nReed and Knospe are installing their event plane detector at Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Ion Collider (RHIC) in Long Island, New York, one of only two operating particle collider facilities in existence. They are running experiments to forward their collaborative and individual research on the strong nuclear force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature, along with gravity, electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force. The strong force holds atomic nuclei together.\nTheir detector is part of the sPHENIX initiative, a \"radical makeover\" of the original Pioneering High Energy Nuclear Interaction eXperiment (PHENIX) facility, designed to investigate high energy collisions of heavy ions and protons. It will include new components that significantly enhance scientists' ability to learn about quark-gluon plasma.\n\"At the collider, we can see what\u2015in the first 10 microseconds or so\u2015the universe looked like,\" says Reed.\nTheir event plane detector is designed to measure the trajectories of fundamental charged particles post-collision.\n\"If you have two nuclei that are colliding with each other, unless it's a head-on collision, you will have different orientations of the nuclei with a line connecting their centers, horizontally or vertically. This is called the event plane,\" says Knospe. \"In addition to mapping the event plane, the detector will help us quantify how violent a collision it was. Just by measuring the number of particles, we can estimate whether it was a head-on collision, or a very glancing peripheral collision.\"\nBuilding the detector was a labor-intensive process. A number of students, some with the support of a National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates award, worked with Reed and Knospe to build parts of it, including the scintillator panels. The panels light up when struck by a charged particle, which allows the particle's position to be measured.\nThe detector, designed to be an \"add-on\" to sPHENIX , \"looks like two disks and will, essentially, go on either side of sPhenix, right inside the magnet,\" she says. \"The disks will measure where two charged particles or ions collide and will help answer a lot of questions and determine important measurements.\"\nReed, whose work focuses on examining the particle jets, or the spraying particles, that fly out from the high-energy collisions, says that among the major scientific questions that the data collection and analysis could help answer are: Why is there more matter than antimatter in the universe? Why did the Big Bang create coldspots and hotspots which, in some cases, coalesce into galaxies and other entities? Her work is supported by a National Science Foundation CAREER Award.\nKnospe is focused on using heavy subatomic particles called quarkonia to probe the quark-gluon plasma and characterize its properties in detail. His work is supported by a Department of Energy CAREER Award.\nUltimately, Reed's and Knospe's work at the collider will allow for a better understanding of the strong force or, as Knospe puts it\u2014\"how this big soup of all these subatomic particles came together to become this new state of matter or really, the very oldest.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLehigh University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhysicists lead experiments to explore the force that binds the universe (2023, April 13)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tretrieved 15 June 2023\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom https://phys.org/news/2023-04-physicists-explore-universe.html\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This document is subject to copyright.

People and businesses have been replacing them with far more efficient LED lights.\nUnfortunately, that transition has come at a cost. LED lights do not provide the same degree of high-fidelity color rendering as incandescent bulbs. So, many consumers have been pining for the old days when they could use old-fashioned light bulbs. In this new effort, the team in China may have found a solution\u2014instead of tossing out incandescent bulbs, they have made them more efficient.\nThe standard incandescent light bulb is a model of simplicity. It is made by placing a wire filament inside of a glass bulb. Light is produced by applying heat (using electricity) to the filament. The bulb serves to hold an inert gas that prevents oxidizing. Such bulbs are also easy and inexpensive to mass produce. Unfortunately, they are inefficient and have a short lifespan. In this new effort, the research team sought to improve both aspects as a means for producing a bulb with more natural lighting than LEDs.\nTo make the bulb last longer, the team used a two-layer filament, one made using carbon nanotube and the other from a ceramic material made up of nitrogen and boron. Then, to make the bulb more efficient, they placed their filament in a ceramic box rather than a glass bulb and gave it a window made of a type of quartz that allows for recycling photons. They call the result a photon-recycling incandescent lighting device, with energy efficiency nearly equal to an LED bulb, a much longer lifetime and color fidelity nearly on a par with traditional incandescent bulbs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHeng Zhang et al, A photon-recycling incandescent lighting device, Science Advances (2023).

   "text": "The flow of matter, from macroscopic water currents to the microscopic flow of electric charge, underpins much of the infrastructure of modern times. In the search for breakthroughs in energy efficiency, data storage capacity, and processing speed, scientists search for ways in which to control the flow of quantum aspects of matter such as the \"spin\" of an electron\u2014its magnetic moment\u2014or its \"valley state,\" a novel quantum aspect of matter found in many two dimensional materials.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA team of researchers at the Max Born Institute in Berlin have recently discovered a route to induce and control the flow of spin and valley currents at ultrafast times with specially designed laser pulses, offering a new perspective on the ongoing search for the next generation of information technologies.\nUltrafast laser control over the fundamental quantum degrees of freedom of matter represents the outstanding foundational challenge to be met in establishing future information technologies beyond the semi-conductor electronics that defines our present time. Two of the most promising quantum degrees of freedom in this respect are the spin of the electron and the \"valley index,\" the latter an emergent degree of freedom of two dimensional materials related to the quasiparticle momentum.\nBoth spintronics and valleytronics offer many potential advantages over classical electronics in terms of data manipulation velocity and energy efficiency. However, while spin excitations suffer from a dynamical loss of character arising from the spin-orbit induced spin precession, the valley wavefunction represents a \"data bit\" whose stability is threatened only by intervalley scattering, a feature controllable be sample quality. Valleytronics thus presents a potentially robust platform for going beyond classical electronics.\nAt the heart of any future valleytronics or spintronics technologies will, in addition to quantum excitations encoding data bits, reside the control and creation of valley- and spin-currents.\nHowever, while sustained attention has been paid to the task of tailoring lightforms on ultrafast time scales to selectively excite valley quasiparticles, the precise creation and control of valley-currents and spin-currents\u2014vital for any future valleytronics technology\u2014has remained beyond the realm of ultrafast light control.\nIn a study recently published in Science Advances, a team of researchers from the Max Born Institute in Berlin have shown how a hybrid laser pulse combining two polarization types allows complete control over ultrafast laser-light-induced currents.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nControl over the charge state by circularly polarized light is now well established, the famous \"spin-valley locking\" of the transition metal dichalcogenides that has its origin in the valley selective response to circularly polarized light. This can be viewed as arising from a selection rule involving the magnetic quantum numbers of the d-orbitals that comprise the gap edge states. While circularly polarized light excites valley charge it does not, however, create a valley current.\nThis situation arises as for each quasi-momentum in the valley kvalley that is excited a corresponding \u2212kvalley also is excited: the Bloch velocities thus cancel and there is no net valley current.\nFull control over light induced valley currents, their magnitude and direction, thus requires going beyond the spin-valley locking paradigm of circularly polarized light. Creation of a valley excited state that does result in a net valley and spin current must therefore involving breaking the local kvalley, \u2212kvalley degeneracy. As the laser vector potential couples directly to crystal quasi-momentum, k \u2192 k \u2212 A(t)/c, the most effective way in which this can be done is through a linearly polarized single cycle pulse with duration comparable to that of the circularly polarized pulse: such a pulse will evidently be in the \"THz window\" of 1 THz to 50 THz\nThe hencomb lightform generates a substantial residual (i.e. persisting after the laser pulse) current. This results from a non-cancelation of the Bloch velocities of excited quasi-momentum, as the distribution of excited charge is now shifted off the high symmetry K point by exactly the polarization vector of the THz pulse.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Schematic illustration of the action of hencomb pulse: (i) a half cycle of THz light drives an intraband motion sending states distant from the gap edge to the gap edge; (ii) the optical component excites states across the gap; (iii) finally the second half cycle of THz light returns the state to its original momentum. The overall action of the hencomb pulse is thus to excite charge at a finite valley momentum determined by the THz pulse polarization vector. Credit: Forschungsverbund Berlin e.V. (FVB)\n             \n\n\nThe physical picture underpinning the action of this pulse is schematically illustrated as such: a half cycle of the THz component of the hencomb pulse drives an intraband motion sending states distant from the gap edge to the gap edge. At this point the circularly polarized component excites this charge across the gap, with finally the second half cycle of the THz component returning the charge to its original momentum.\nIn this way charge has been excited at a quasi-momentum q with conduction-valence energy difference, \u03f5c \u2212 \u03f5v, that is not equal to the circularly polarized light energy \u210f\u03c9circ (and hence not equal to the band gap to which this light is tuned). The polarization vector of the THz light component represents the key control parameters of a hencomb pulses, with the polarization direction and amplitude respectively determining the direction and amplitude of the light induced current. In the way such hencomb pulses represent a route to the direct light control over simultaneously the charge and current state of valley active two dimensional materials, offer a new route towards valleytronics and spintronics at ultrafast times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSangeeta Sharma et al, THz induced giant spin and valley currents, Science Advances (2023).

In particular, he imagined a hypothetical space\u2014which can be pictured as being enclosed in something like an infinite soup can, or \"bulk\"\u2014holding objects like black holes that are acted on by gravity. Maldacena also imagined particles moving on the surface of the can, controlled by quantum mechanics. He realized that mathematically a quantum theory used to describe the particles on the boundary is equivalent to a gravitational theory describing the black holes and spacetime inside the bulk.\n\"This relationship indicates that spacetime itself does not exist fundamentally, but emerges from some quantum nature,\" says Goto. \"Physicists are trying to understand the quantum property that is key.\"\nThe original thought was that quantum entanglement\u2014which links particles no matter how far they are separated\u2014was the most important factor: the more entangled particles on the boundary are, the smoother the spacetime within the bulk.\n\"But just considering the degree of entanglement on the boundary cannot explain all the properties of black holes, for instance, how their interiors can grow,\" says Goto.\nSo Goto and iTHEMS colleagues Tomoki Nosaka and Masahiro Nozaki searched for another quantum quantity that could apply to the boundary system and could also be mapped to the bulk to describe black holes more fully. In particular, they noted that black holes have a chaotic characteristic that needs to be described.\n\"When you throw something into a black hole, information about it gets scrambled and cannot be recovered,\" says Goto. \"This scrambling is a manifestation of chaos.\"\nThe team came across \"magic,\" which is a mathematical measure of how difficult a quantum state is to simulate using an ordinary classical (non-quantum) computer. Their calculations showed that in a chaotic system almost any state will evolve into one that is \"maximally magical\"\u2014the most difficult to simulate.\nThis provides the first direct link between the quantum property of magic and the chaotic nature of black holes. \"This finding suggests that magic is strongly involved in the emergence of spacetime,\" says Goto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKanato Goto et al, Probing chaos by magic monotones, Physical Review D (2022).

To combat the problem, the research community has entered a new paradigm in materials science. The research and development of two-dimensional quantum materials, that form in sheets and are only a few atoms thick, have opened new doors for sustainable, faster and more energy-efficient data storage and processing in computers and mobiles.\nThe first atomically thin material to be isolated in a laboratory was graphene, a single atom-thick plane of graphite, that resulted in the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics. And in 2017, two-dimensional materials with magnetic properties were discovered for the first time. Magnets play a fundamental role in our everyday lives, from sensors in our cars and home appliances to computer data storage and memory technologies, and the discovery opened for new and more sustainable solutions for a wide range of technology devices.\n\"Two-dimensional magnetic materials are more sustainable because they are atomically thin and offer unique magnetic properties that make them attractive for developing new energy-efficient and ultra-fast applications for sensors and advanced magnetic memory and computing concepts.

But now a group of researchers at Chalmers University of Technology have been able to demonstrate, for the very first time, a new two-dimensional magnetic material-based device at room temperature. They used an iron-based alloy (Fe5GeTe2) with graphene which can be used as a source and detector for spin polarized electrons. And the breakthrough is now believed to enable a range of technical applications in several industries as well as in our everyday lives.\n\"These 2D magnets can be used to develop ultra-compact, faster and more energy-efficient memory devices in computers. They may also be used to develop highly sensitive magnetic sensors for a wide range of applications, including biomedical and environmental monitoring, navigation, and communication,\" explains Bing Zhao, post-doc in Quantum Device Physics and first author of the study published in Advanced Materials.\nConventional electronic logic devices are based on nonmagnetic semiconductors and use the flow of electric charges to achieve information processing and communication. Spintronic devices, on the other hand, exploit the spin of electrons to generate and control charge currents, and to interconvert electrical and magnetic signals.

   "text": "The ATLAS collaboration, the large research consortium involved in analyzing data collected by the ATLAS particle collider at CERN, recently observed the electroweak production of two Z bosons and two jets.

This model describes weak bosons (i.e., bosons responsible for the so-called 'weak force') as mediators of the electroweak interaction.\nThe scattering of massive weak bosons, such as W and Z bosons, is constrained specifically to interactions, where the mediators directly interact and scatter off each other. This scattering, also known as vector-boson scattering (VBS), also involves a type of Feynman diagrams or vertices known (i.e., quartic gauge vertices) that physicists have so far been unable to experimentally probe through other physical processes.\n\"Quartic gauge vertices are a so far unconfirmed section of the SM, which is, however of central importance to the self-consistency of the model,\" the authors told Phys.org. \"An example for this self-consistency is a delicate cancelation of scattering amplitudes involving Triple Gauge Vertices, Quartic Gauge Vertices and Vertices involving the Higgs Boson. A study of these processes is an independent and crucial test of the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) Mechanism for breaking the electroweak symmetry in the SM (EWSB).\"\nFrom the very beginning, one of the crucial objectives of the ATLAS Experiment at CERN has been to search for and measure VBS processes. Run 1 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiment gathered the first evidence of these processes occurring in two W bosons with the same charge. Subsequently, VBS was also observed during interactions between W and Z bosons.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Distribution of the multivariate discriminant in the lllljj signal region.

The final state particles in this collider then interact with the ATLAS detector, leaving hits or energy deposits inside it that can be measured and recorded. These recorded energy deposits are then reconstructed into physical objects such as electrons, muons, jets, etc.\n\"We report the first observation of the electroweak production of two Z bosons and two jets, the rarest process where the scattering of two massive gauge bosons can occur,\" Navarro said. \"The observation as well as the consistency with SM predictions show that the SM of particle physics survives stringent tests down to rarest corner with production cross-section as small as 0.1 fb.\"\nThe ATLAS collaboration's observation of the electroweak production of two Z bosons and two jets could have important implications for further research. In addition to providing experimental evidence confirming the robustness of the SM of particle physics, it motivates further investigations of a mechanism called electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) that leaves characteristic signatures in VBS processes.\nSuch investigations will most likely require new data and more advanced experimental techniques. The LHC started collecting new data in 2022, which will soon result in new ATLAS detector measurements. This data could soon lead to new exciting observations and research efforts.\n\"At a longer time scale, the high-luminosity LHC is expected to deliver 3000/fb of data, which will be 20 times of the dataset analyzed in this paper,\" the authors added. \"After the observation era, we will have more precise measurements of the VBS processes with much larger dataset, which will help to probe the EWSB with higher precision, as well as look for any possible deviation from the SM prediction.

   "text": "Three-dimensional simulations shed light on how energy dissipates within non-Newtonian fluids (fluids in which viscosity depend on the shear rate.) The result is valuable in the context of disaster forecasting and the management of industrial production.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nElastoviscoplastic (EVP) fluids like mud, concrete, and lava are a type of non-Newtonian fluid that exhibit both solid and fluid-like behavior depending on the forces they are subjected to (i.e., applied stress). Their flow behavior is more complex than that of Newtonian fluids, such as water and air, which have a constant viscosity. In a recent study, researchers performed simulations of turbulent EVP fluids, revealing novel insights on the energy transfer mechanism across different scales.\nWater, air, oil and alcohol are well-known examples of fluids. However, they only constitute a particular subset of the possible types of fluids, namely the subset of Newtonian fluids. As the name suggests, Newtonian fluids are those that obey Newton's law of viscosity, characterized by a linear relation between the shear stress and the shear rate. Another way to put it is that the viscosity of Newtonian fluids is independent of the shear rate.\nIn contrast, non-Newtonian fluids do not follow this classical definition, meaning their viscosity changes depending on the forces they are subjected to. For example, elastoviscoplastic (EVP) fluids are a type of non-Newtonian fluid that behave either like a solid or fluid depending on the applied stress. At low stress, they tend to preserve their shape and resist deformation. In contrast, at high stress, they flow like liquids. While EVP fluids are less common than Newtonian fluids in our daily lives, some familiar examples include mud, concrete, and toothpaste.\nIt turns out that understanding how EVP fluids behave during turbulent flow is important in many industrial settings where viscosity can greatly affect the efficiency of a process. Although turbulence is inherently unpredictable and chaotic, characterizing fluid flow behavior at very high flow speeds, some aspects of it can be modeled and described. In particular, a theory put forward by Andrey N. Kolmogorov in 1941 describes how energy is transferred from large to small scales in turbulent Newtonian fluids, prescribing a power-law scaling for the fluid's energy spectrum. However, not much is known about the turbulent behavior of EVP fluids, including whether the Kolmogorov's scaling law holds for them.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nAgainst this backdrop, a research team from the Complex Fluids and Flows Unit at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) in Japan decided to analyze the problem in detail. The team, consisting of two Ph.D. students, Mr. Mohamed Abdelgawad and Mr. Ianto Cannon, and Professor Marco Edoardo Rosti, ran 3D numerical simulations of EVP fluids showing a homogeneous, isotropic turbulence and focused on their plastic behavior. Their findings were published in the journal Nature Physics.\nOne of the most important results of the study was related to the energy distribution within a turbulent EVP fluid. In turbulent flows, energy is transferred from large to small scales through a cascade of vortices and eddies. This distribution of energy across scales can be quantified using an energy spectrum.\n\"For Newtonian fluids like water, the energy spectrum follows Kolmogorov's scaling with a scaling exponent of \u22125/3. This scaling is well-established and has been confirmed in many experiments and simulations,\" explains Mr. Abdelgawad. \"In our study, however, we found that plastic effects in EVP fluids alter their turbulent behavior, giving rise to a new scaling exponent of \u22122.3. This suggests a different energy transfer mechanism, unlike our classical understanding of turbulence in Newtonian fluids.\"\nExcited, the researchers sought to unveil this new mechanism. Through further analysis of the simulation data, they showed that EVP fluids do not, in fact, obey Kolmogorov's theory and, instead, show an energy dissipation pattern that resembles a fractal (a non-regular geometric shape with non-regularity at all scales). More specifically, the energy dissipation in turbulent EVP fluids is multifractal, meaning the degree of non-regularity changes with scale.\nFurther, the team observed that another key difference between turbulent Newtonian fluids and EVP fluids was in their \"intermittency,\" with EVP fluids showing a relatively higher intermittency, a property that characterizes the likelihood of extreme events occurring, such as localized regions of high flow velocity or high energy dissipation. Given that natural disasters like landslides and volcanic eruptions involve turbulent EVP fluids, this result is particularly valuable in the context of disaster forecast and management.\nAdditionally, the findings of this work can be leveraged to design and optimize a wide range of industrial process, including polymer manufacture, concrete pumping, mud drilling, and oil production. \"Our work will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the behavior of turbulent non-Newtonian fluids in general, which could help us model the flow of high plasticity fluids better. In addition, it can have far-reaching implications for a range of industries, including pharmaceuticals, food processing, and energy,\" concludes Mr. Cannon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarco Rosti, Scaling and intermittency in turbulent flows of elastoviscoplastic fluids, Nature Physics (2023).

   "text": "Developing new quantum devices relies on controlling how electrons behave. A material called graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms, has fascinated researchers in recent years because its electrons behave as if they have no mass. For decades, scientists have also been interested in high-temperature superconductors: ceramic materials where electron interactions yield a macroscopic quantum state where electrons pair with each other. They do so at a temperature above the usual superconducting temperature of metals, which approaches absolute zero.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a recent study published in Physical Review Letters, researchers from the SUNY Polytechnic Institute, Stony Brook University and the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the US, along with Aalto University in Finland, demonstrated a new electronic device that employs the unique ways in which electrons behave in these two materials\u2014graphene and high-temperature superconductors.\nThe experiment, led by Sharadh Jois and Ji Ung Lee from SUNY with the support of theoretical work done by Jose Lado, assistant professor at Aalto, demonstrated a new quantum device that combines both graphene and an unconventional high-temperature superconductor.\nIn particular, the team demonstrated that the electronic transport between graphene and the high-temperature superconductor was dominated by a unique transport process arising from the combination of two peculiar properties: graphene's Klein tunneling and the superconductor's Andreev reflection. The team showed experimentally, for the first time, that this transport process was fully consistent with the existing theoretical predictions concerning hybrid Andreev-Klein electronic transport.\nTunneling and reflecting\nThe study relies on two unique phenomena found in these materials: Klein tunneling in graphene and Andreev reflection in unconventional high-temperature superconductors. Because graphene electrons behave as if they have no mass, they can move in situations where normal electrons could not. This phenomenon is known as Klein tunneling.\nIn turn, electrons in high-temperature superconductors form so-called Cooper pairs of two electrons. Cooper pairs can have unique mathematical structures, leading to unconventional superconducting states. When a Cooper pair forms exactly at the meeting point of a standard material such a piece of metal and a superconductor, it can result in a phenomenon called Andreev reflection, in which the pair \"kicks back\" another kind of particle into the metal.\nWhile Andreev reflection involving conventional superconductors and metals is well understood, doing the same with graphene electrons and high-temperature superconductors had not been demonstrated until now.\nA milestone in graphene quantum devices\n\"The demonstration of electronic transport stemming from graphene's Klein tunneling and unconventional superconducting pairing establishes a milestone in graphene-based quantum devices. This observation establishes the starting point to develop a whole new family of graphene-based superconducting quantum circuits that exploit unconventional superconductivity,\" Lado says.\nThe unique electronic properties of graphene have made it a promising platform for developing electronics that do not consume a lot of power. Conventional superconductors are key materials in a variety of quantum devices, and they are especially important in one of the strategies to build both qubit and topological quantum computers. By combining the two, the study's results can open new fundamental physics in these materials and ultimately establish a whole new platform for quantum technology devices.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSharadh Jois et al, Andreev Reflection and Klein Tunneling in High-Temperature Superconductor-Graphene Junctions, Physical Review Letters (2023).

   "text": "Holography\u2014the use of light projection to display images\u2014can be used to construct holograms, which are three-dimensional structures of light that depict true-to-life objects and scenes. While today's technologies can't yet produce the incredibly lifelike holograms of science fiction movies, researchers from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have made a significant leap toward this goal.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA team of scientists and engineers led by Federico Capasso, the Robert L. Wallace Professor of Applied Physics and Vinton Hayes Senior Research Fellow in Electrical Engineering at SEAS, has reported in Nature Photonics an entirely new way of creating holograms using threads of light layered to construct 2D sheets containing tightly-controlled arrays of light. These sheets can then be tightly stacked\u2014like a pile of deli cheese\u2014to depict 3D objects.\n\"This research leverages in an innovative way the widely used and commercially established technology of spatial light modulators to shape light as it propagates, creating an entirely new class of holograms,\" says Capasso. \"I foresee that this holography method will have impact on virtual and augmented reality, biological imaging, volumetric displays, human-computer interactions, interactive educational tools, and more.\"\nTraditional holography methods arrange light in planes moving away from the eye of the viewer like a series of sequential dominoes, which is problematic because the layers farthest away become harder to see. That can disrupt the viewer's depth perception and ultimately make 3D objects appear in diminished detail. To solve this problem, Capasso's team and collaborators from University of S\u00e3o Paulo and Brazil's State University of Campinas devised a holography method to propagate slices of light perpendicularly to the optical display, so that the viewer is looking along the full length of the slices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA 3D holographic object created in the lab of Federico Capasso. Credit: Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences\n\n\"By doing so, we have mitigated the depth perception problem that has traditionally affected holography,\" says Ahmed Dorrah, first author on the paper and a research associate in the Capasso group. \"We can also achieve uniformly spaced sheets of light while maintaining low crosstalk between the sheets and high resolution of depicted images and objects.\"\nDorrah says the method could someday be used to depict any 3D hologram, viewable from any angle with continuous depth, as if it's physically present. \"At the heart of this development is a special kind of light beam called a Bessel beam,\" he says. Unlike more commonly used laser beams which diffract and grow less intense as they move farther from their source, Bessel beams maintain their intensity and can even \"heal\" themselves after encountering obstacles by winding around them.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Bessel beams spread outward in a ring-like pattern. Combining more than one Bessel beam\u2014a process called superposition\u2014provides precise control over the intensity of light along any given point through interference,\" says Michel Zamboni-Rached, professor of electrical engineering at Brazil's State University of Campinas and senior collaborator on this work. \"You can selectively illuminate desired parts of these light sheets,\" he adds, without losing the depth of field crucial for depicting images and objects crisply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother 3D holographic object created in the lab of Federico Capasso. Credit: Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences\n\nBy stacking these superimposed beams together to form sheets of light, it's possible to additively create a \"3D-printed\" projection made of precisely structured light. Capasso's team is especially interested in leveraging this new method to improve biological research.\n\"I think the selective control we can exert over light's intensity could be combined with microscopy methods to have greater control over where light is sent into a biological sample,\" says Dorrah. That's important because laser beams used in microscopy can damage living cells through a process known as phototoxicity, limiting how much imaging a tissue sample can withstand.\nDorrah is also keen to adapt the method for optogenetics research, in which brain circuits are genetically engineered so that tissue activity can be triggered on or off in response to light, allowing scientists to study how certain cells impact behavior. With light sheet holography, \"you could activate targeted cells or networks of cells within optogenetic circuits with a very high degree of accuracy and specificity,\" he says.\nThe new holography method was discovered rather serendipitously by Capasso's team. Dorrah and his collaborators from Brazil had been developing techniques to trap particles in focal points using Bessel beams of light, so that atoms in specific spots of space and time could be better studied. That's when the team started to wonder if stacking these beams in sheet shapes could be used to build holograms.\nThe group was awed when they tested the technique and saw how well it worked. \"Usually, we develop a new theory, we test it with an experiment, the results are flawed, and then we rethink our approach,\" says Leonardo Ambrosio, professor of electrical engineering at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and another senior collaborator. \"But this time, our initial experiments far exceeded even our most optimistic expectations. We were amazed by the complexity of images and objects we could make.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAhmed H.

   "text": "Helium usually has two protons and two neutrons strongly bound to each other, often forming a substructure within the nucleus. A nucleus composed of several such substructures is called a cluster structure. In the standard picture, nuclei are difficult to understand in terms of so-called shell structure; because there was no way to clearly distinguish whether each nucleus had a cluster or a shell structure.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor Wataru Horiuchi and Professor Naoyuki Itagaki from the Osaka Metropolitan University Graduate School of Science, have developed an \"antisymmetrized quasicluster model\" that can represent cluster and shell structure in a single framework, which they applied to carbon and oxygen.

   "text": "Photoacoustic imaging is a cutting-edge technology that uses light and sound to create images of the inside of the body. When a pulsed laser illuminates the surface of biological tissue, part of the photon energy is absorbed by the tissue to generate heat. The increase of the heat causes thermoelastic expansion of the tissue, releasing energy in the form of ultrasonic waves. By scanning the sample and collecting the corresponding photoacoustic signals, researchers are able reconstruct 2D or 3D images of the biological tissue.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsually, ultrasonic transducers collect the photoacoustic signals. But because sound waves attenuate in air, it is usually necessary to add water or ultrasonic gel between the tissue sample and the transducer, to ensure signal detection sensitivity. Such physical contact or immersion may have significant effects on biological samples, greatly limiting the applicability of conventional photoacoustic imaging in many practical scenarios.\nOn the other hand, due to the innate structural and material properties of ultrasonic transducers, their central response frequency and detection bandwidth are limited, which may reduce the sensitivity of the system in terms of broadband signal detection. Considering these limitations, traditional photoacoustic imaging requires an update for high-quality photoacoustic research.\nPhotoacoustic remote sensing imaging is a novel photoacoustic imaging modality. Unlike conventional acoustic detection using ultrasonic transducers, photoacoustic remote sensing uses another laser beam to detect acoustic signals. Specifically, another laser source is adopted as the probe beam confocal with the excitation beam. When the sample absorbs energy to produce initial pressure, the refractive index of the sample surface changes instantaneously due to the elasto-optical refractive index modulation.\nBy monitoring the reflection intensity of the probe beam, the corresponding photoacoustic signals may be analyzed. All-optical detection of acoustic signals eliminates direct contact with the sample. Meanwhile, due to the optical sensing, the detection bandwidth may be easily transferred from the limited ultrasonic transducer to a broader photodiode, which provides the possibility to further improve the detection sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio of the system.\nBased on the above insights, a research team from the University of Hong Kong recently reported near-infrared photoacoustic remote sensing microscopy for non-contact imaging of lipids. As described in Advanced Photonics Nexus, the team's photoacoustic remote sensing microscopy uses a 1.7-\u03bcm thulium-doped fiber laser as the pump beam to selectively stimulate the C\u2013H bond in lipids. At the same time, another 1.5-\u03bcm continuous-wave (CW) laser is adopted as the detection beam confocal with the pump beam to detect the initial ultrasonic pressure. This optical detection of ultrasonic signals eliminates the use of ultrasonic transducers and realizes remote sensing of photoacoustic signals. Meanwhile, this method provides a broader detection bandwidth and improves the detection sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio of the system.\nIn their experiment, the team first demonstrated the imaging results of two forms of pure lipid samples through photoacoustic remote sensing and analyzed the corresponding power spectrum density of the signals. They found that the optical detection method could provide a broader frequency response compared with a conventional transducer. They also performed photoacoustic remote sensing imaging on biological samples, including nematodes and brain slices, which showed good contrast and signal-to-noise ratios, demonstrating high-performance imaging capability on the tissue scale.\n\"Photoacoustic remote sensing microscopy achieves label-free imaging that can target specific molecular bonds,\" remarks corresponding author Kenneth K. Y. Wong, Professor of Engineering at the University of Hong Kong. He adds, \"Optical detection of ultrasonic signals provides non-contact operation and a broader frequency response. Meanwhile, the photoacoustic remote sensing microscopy shows high performance for lipid distribution mapping on the tissue scale.\"\nThe newly developed technique suggests great application potential in a variety of biomedical research.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGuyue Hu et al, Noncontact photoacoustic lipid imaging by remote sensing on first overtone of the C-H bond, Advanced Photonics Nexus (2023).

   "text": "Some classical computers have error correction built into their memories based on bits; quantum computers, to be workable in the future, will need error correction mechanisms, too, based on the vastly more sensitive qubits.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCornell researchers have recently taken a step toward fault-tolerant quantum computing: they constructed a simple model containing exotic particles called non-Abelian anyons, compact and practical enough to run on modern quantum hardware. Realizing these particles, which can only exist in two dimensions, is a move towards implementing it in the real world.\nThanks to some creative thinking, Yuri Lensky, a former Bethe/Wilkins/Kavli Institute at Cornell (KIC) postdoctoral fellow in physics in the College of Arts and Sciences (A&S), collaborating with Eun-Ah Kim, professor of physics (A&S), came up with a simple \"recipe\" that could be used for robustly computing with non-Abelian anyons, including specific instructions for executing the effect experimentally on devices available today.\nTheir paper, \"Graph Gauge Theory of Mobile Non-Abelian Anyons in a Qubit Stabilizer Code,\" written in collaboration with theorists at Google Quantum AI, published March 24 in Annals of Physics. Google Quantum AI researchers, together with Lensky and Kim, have proved the theory with a successful experiment as reported in a preprint publication, \"Observation of Non-Abelian Exchange Statistics on a Superconducting Processor,\" on the research-sharing platform arXiv.\n\"This two-dimensional state is interesting both from a quantum condensed matter physics perspective\u2014it has some novel properties that are very special to 2D physics\u2014and from a quantum information perspective,\" Lensky said. \"It's something truly quantum, but it's also potentially useful for quantum computation. It protects bits of quantum information by storing them non-locally, and our protocol allows us to compute with these bits.\"\nKim explained the principle that animates non-Abelian anyons by holding out two identical one-pound barbells. When she crosses her arms, the identical barbells change positions, but as objects defined by classical physics, their state remains the same. They are interchangeable.\nIf those barbells represent two identical quantum particles, remarkably in certain 2D systems their trails through space-time can produce a measurable record of the change (picture the crossed arms.) This process of exchange is called a braid, after the shapes of the particle trails.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"Quantum mechanically, when you move one particle around the other,\" Kim said, holding one weight still and moving the other in a circle around it, \"the wave function, which is a solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation describing quantum mechanical motion, can be multiplied by a phase factor or it can become something that's very different.\"\nWhen the wave function gains a global sign that can only be observed through interferometry, a measurement of the interference of waves, that's called an Abelian anyon. When the wave function becomes measurably different, it's a non-Abelian anyon, she said.\nNon-Abelian anyons could be harnessed to create qubits defined not on a single particle, but on a pair of identical quantum particles: nonlocally encoded.\n\"If I put the qubit shared between these particles in a zero state and move them apart, then whatever happens locally to one of these anyons, the zero state will remain. The qubit set to zero is safe from corruption,\" Kim said. \"Non-Abelian anyons could be used in a platform for protected qubits.\"\nBut while physicists have theorized about these exotic particles for years\u2014Alexei Kitaev proposed operating on protected bits of quantum memory by braiding non-Abelian anyons back around 2001, Lensky said\u2014they have never been observed in a physical system before now.\nWhen Google Quantum AI developed the quantum processor platform capabilities to realize the surface code and braiding of Abelian anyons in a physical system, Lensky said, \"This was [our] inspiration to look for a way to realize the physics of non-Abelian anyons as soon as possible.\"\n\"We knew they had the working ingredients, but they didn't have a recipe,\" Kim said. \"We figured out how to move these non-Abelian anyons, then we told the experimentalists what to do. It was possible because Yuri and I were thinking in a flexible, creative and open-minded way.\"\nPast theoretical research identified non-Abelian properties, but came up short on how to move them, a necessary step. A key insight from Lensky and Kim was to give up the regularity of a grid and arrange qubits in an almost hand-drawn manner but backed up by robust mathematics.\n\"After this simple geometric insight, using gauge theory, we were able to come up with the protocol of taking this picture and implementing it on a chip in a robust and efficient way,\" Kim said. \"With this 10-qubit system, we were able to encode multiple non-Abelian anyons, and therefore multiple logical information-carrying qubits, and a precise recipe for what the experimentalists need to do every step of the way.\"\n\"Although the focus of the theory and experiment is simply to realize non-Abelian anyons in the real world, this can also be viewed as a first small step towards implementing computation by braiding,\" Lensky said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYuri D.

   "text": "Quantum information is a powerful technology for increasing the amount of information that can be processed and communicated securely. Using quantum entanglement to securely distribute a secret quantum state among multiple parties is known as \"quantum state sharing.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn important protocol in quantum networks and cryptography, quantum state sharing works like this (in simple terms): a secret quantum state is divided into n shares and given to n players. The secret state can only be reconstructed if k (where k>n/2) players cooperate, while the remaining n-k players cannot access the information. This protocol can also be used for quantum error correction, allowing the reconstruction of the secret state even if some of the information is lost.\nIn quantum information, there are two types of systems: discrete variable and continuous variable systems. Discrete variable systems are good because they don't lose information easily, while continuous variable systems are good because the generation and processing of quantum states are deterministic rather than probabilistic, which enables a high degree of precision.\nOne thing people have tried to do with continuous variable systems is share quantum states (information) between different places. But to do this, they need to use a technique called electrical feedforward, which involves converting signals between electrical and optical forms. Unfortunately, this technique limits the bandwidth of the quantum state sharing process.\nAn all-optical quantum state sharing protocol promises a way to share quantum information using light, without converting it into electrical signals. This protocol has been proposed theoretically, but it has not yet been implemented because it is difficult to control the noise that is naturally present in the amplified output state of certain types of optical devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n                The typical noise power results for {1,3} reconstruction structure and the corresponding adversary structure {2}. (a) and (b) show the quadrature variances with classical modulations for the input secret state and the output state of classical {1,3} structure. (c) and (d) show the quadrature variances without classical modulations for the input secret state, the output state of {1,3} structure, and the corresponding classical {1,3} structure. (e) and (f) show the quadrature variances of {2} structure. Credit: Yingxuan Chen, East China Normal University\n             \n\n\nAs reported in Advanced Photonics, researchers from East China Normal University recently implemented such a system successfully. They used a low-noise amplifier that is based on a four-wave mixing process to replace the electrical feedforward device.\nWith this new method, they were able to share quantum states between two or more players, where any two players can work together to retrieve the secret state while the rest of the players get nothing. They tested three different reconstruction structures and found that the average fidelity of all the structures was 0.74 \u00b10.03, which is better than the classical limit of 2/3. They also verified that this new method can be used within a certain range of bandwidth.\nAccording to corresponding author Jietai Jing, Professor at East China Normal University's State Key Laboratory of Precision Spectroscopy, \"This study aims to eliminate the bandwidth limit of the quantum state sharing process in the continuous variable system. The experimental results provide an all-optical platform for implementing all-optical quantum state sharing.\" He adds, \"This research paves the way to construct an all-optical broadband quantum network.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYingxuan Chen et al, Deterministic all-optical quantum state sharing, Advanced Photonics (2023).

   "text": "Optical micro and nanofibers (MNFs) have extensive applications in nonlinearity generation, near-field optics, quantum optics, and miniaturized sensing. Although MNFs have fostered the development of various disciplines, there have been few studies on the topic until the convenient fabrication of low-loss MNFs was made possible.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the standard and most conventional methods of drawing out silica nanowires, the fiber material would be first softened by local heating and then thinned and elongated by applying a pulling force. The decreased diameter of fabricated MNFs can approach the subwavelength dimension. It would thus support modal fields with strong evanescent waves tunneling through the silica material into the surrounding medium. Easy fabrication, low loss, light mass, and pronounced evanescent waves have made MNFs one of the best candidates for studying light-matter interactions.\nMany efforts have been devoted to improving the fabrication units to produce MNFs of desired quality. The most common taper-drawing machine contains a flame and two translation stages. They apply the pulling force to the fiber by stretching its fixed ends in opposite directions. According to the hot-zone theory, the specific shape of MNFs is determined by the length variation of the heated region relative to the net elongation of the fiber.\nMNFs with designed taper geometries can be prepared by adopting the \"flame brush\" technique to manipulate the hot zone. However, using flames to heat the fiber suffers from air fluctuations and the inertia of the moving burner. Electrical heaters were introduced for programmable and steady temperature distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n                a) Schematic of the experimental set-up, showing a pre-tapered fiber with a metal plate attached to it inside an SEM chamber.

Their function requires complex optical alignment and high input light power. The substitution of translation stages can take multiple forms as long as the pulling force can be exerted along the fiber. Although the techniques in principle provide a myriad of viable fabrication configurations, each specified for certain operational conditions, they are explored only within the most explicit scheme of \"heat and pull\".\nIn a new paper published in Light: Advanced Manufacturing, the first author Qiannan Jia and co-workers have developed a unique fiber-tapering technique that combines plasmonic heaters and deformed optical fibers.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers demonstrated a unique technique for MNF fabrication that excluded using any of the aforementioned bulky fabrication components. Pieces of metal plates were introduced to serve as portable micro-sized heaters, which absorbed fiber-delivered light efficiently through plasmonic effects. The light power required in this step was only a few microwatts. The tensile stress of the macroscopically bent fibers provided the pulling force without the use of translation stages.\nThe researchers emphasized that the proposed plate-fiber system was self-sufficient in heat and pull. Implementing the process required no conventional bulky accessories, such as the translation stage, flame burner, or free-space optical components. Owing to its small volume, the plate\u2013fiber system could be transferred into a scanning electron microscope (SEM) chamber.

   "text": "Dynamic control of terahertz (THz) waves at will with an ultra-compact device is important for THz technologies in biomedical imaging, telecommunications, detection, and beyond. However, tunable THz devices made of conventional materials are usually bulky, and they tend to have limited modulation depths and functionalities, due to weak interactions between naturally existing materials and THz waves. Metasurfaces\u2014functional materials endowed with unparalleled flexibility to manipulate light at the deep-subwavelength scale\u2014provide a powerful platform for dynamic control of THz waves.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining passive metasurfaces with different external-stimuli-controlled materials, optically controlled metadevices have attracted attention in this regard. Their attractive properties include ultra-fast modulation speed and high modulation pixel resolution. Most optically controlled metadevices can achieve light modulation that is either selective or unselective of frequency. Dual-mode yet distinctly tunable light manipulation\u2014say, upon adjusting an external knob in a simple device\u2014is highly desired for applications in integrated optics.\nAs reported in Advanced Photonics, researchers from Fudan University's Department of Physics recently established a novel metasurface-based approach that achieves dynamic dual-mode modulation of THz waves by varying the wavelength of pumping light with an additional knob. Specifically, their experiment demonstrated that a pre-designed dielectric metasurface can realize mode-selective or mode-unselective modulations on incident THz waves, by switching the wavelength of the pump wavelength (e.g., 515 nm or 1030 nm). Their theoretical analyses revealed that such dual-mode modulation can be effectively controlled by carefully designing the spatial overlap between the wave-functions of the metasurface's resonant modes and the regions perturbed by the pump-laser excitation at different wavelengths.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Experimental demonstration of the dynamic dual-mode THz wave modulation.

Then, they presented a device that can encrypt optical information so that it displays a pre-designed holographic pattern only when excited by a pump beam at a pre-determined correct wavelength.\nAccording to corresponding author Qiong He, Professor of Physics at Fudan University, \"We anticipate that this work will stimulate many new tunable devices with distinct light-modulation functionalities.\" He adds, \"These functionalities may be useful for numerous applications, such as sensing, security, and next generation wireless communications.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHaoyang Zhou et al, Optically controlled dielectric metasurfaces for dynamic dual-mode modulation on terahertz waves, Advanced Photonics (2023).

   "text": "Since ancient times, mankind has tried to tailor materials by combining different substances. Imagine a world where materials properties could be flexibly changed on demand by simply shining light onto them. A group of physicists from across Europe has now made a decisive step towards this goal by dressing electrons moving in a solid with light.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team, which includes researchers from the Universities of Regensburg and Marburg, the Max Planck Institute for Structure and Dynamics of Matter in Hamburg, the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland, and others, observed for the first time how exotic states, known as Floquet bands, arise in a crystal. The discovery, which has been published in Nature, could revolutionize the way we think about material properties.\n\"The discovery of new material properties usually depends on our ability to control the chemical composition of the material,\" said Marburg physicist Prof. Dr. Ulrich H\u00f6fer, a lead author of the paper who also holds an adjunct professorship at University of Regensburg. \"Purely optical manipulation of material properties could take physics into a new era by enabling new functionalities on demand.\"\nThe team used the method of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to study the surface electrons of the topological insulator bismuth telluride. In this material, the electrons can move ballistically for long times without scattering. By employing intense light pulses, the researchers could drive these electrons periodically through the crystal.\nThis led to an exotic quantum effect, causing the electrons to have not just one fixed energy state, but many energy states evenly spaced apart by the driving photon energy. These so-called Floquet bands are hybrids between electrons and light. \"However, the dynamic properties of such states have remained elusive until now,\" explains Regensburg physicist Prof. Dr. Rupert Huber, another lead author.\nThe team's measurements went far beyond the limit of what could be achieved to date with this technique. They managed to take actual videos of the moving electrons with a time resolution better than a single oscillation cycle of the electromagnetic carrier wave of light. As a result, they made an unforeseen discovery: \"Surprisingly, Floquet bands form already after a single optical cycle,\" says Dr. Suguru Ito, the first author of the publication. \"Our experiment opens up the possibility of visualizing a large number of transient quantum states,\" adds Huber. \"This paves the way to tailored quantum functionalities and ultrafast electronics.\"\nThe experimental findings are supported by theoretical modeling contributed by Dr. Michael Sch\u00fcler of the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland, and Dr. Michael Sentef of the Max Planck Institute for Structure and Dynamics of Matter in Hamburg, Germany.\nHaving established the fundamental time limit for light-induced material engineering, the team's breakthrough discovery could lead to a new era of materials science, enabling the creation of new functionalities on demand. Following this avenue, Prof. Dr. Ulrich H\u00f6fer and Prof. Dr. Rupert Huber were recently jointly awarded an ERC Synergy Grant from the European Research Council for their \"Orbital Cinema\" research project, which aims to take slow-motion videos of electronic motion in quantum mechanical orbitals of single molecules and atoms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tS.

   "text": "A team led by Prof. Zeng Changgan and Associate Researcher Li Lin from the University of Science and Technology (USTC) / Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Key Laboratory of Strongly-Coupled Quantum Matter Physics, collaborating with Prof. Feng Ji's team from Peking University, revealed significant quantum interference effect in inter-layer transport process for the first time using graphene-based electronic double-layer systems. Their work was published in Nature Communications.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoulomb drag is an effect that occurs between two conductive layers in proximity but insulated from each other, wherein moving carriers in one layer (active layer) induces the transport of carriers in the other layer (passive layer), thereby generating an open-circuit voltage in the passive layer.\nCoulomb drag has been widely applied in previous studies of long-range interactions between carriers, such as the Bose-Einstein condensation of indirect excitons. However, there is a lack of research on the external field response and possible quantum effects of the Coulomb drag.\nAs a two-dimensional electron gas, graphene has highly adjustable carrier types and density, and using boron nitride (hBN) as an insulating layer, the distance between two layers of graphene can be reduced to a few nanometers, providing an ideal platform for studying the characteristics of inter-layer Coulomb drag.\nOn this account, the team constructed multiple graphene-based electronic double-layer systems such as double layers of bilayer graphene (BLG/BLG) with hBN as the insulating spacer, double layers of monolayer graphene (MLG/MLG) and MLG/BLG. By applying an external magnetic field on the graphene-based double-layer systems, the team observed that in a wide range of temperature and carrier density, the magneto-drag resistance deviates significantly from classical drag resistance in the low-field regime.\nThis low-field correction is sensitive to the band topology of the graphene layers. For example, a peak feature was observed in the low-field correction of BLG/BLG and MLG/MLG, while the BLG/MLG correction showed a valley feature.\nBy analyzing the transport process, the team found that the observed low-field correction can be well attributed to the quantum interference in the Coulomb drag between two layers that are interrelated by time reversal and mirror reflection. The emergence of such quantum interference relies on the formation of superimposing inter-layer diffusion paths, wherein the impurity potential scatterings from the intermediate insulating layer play a crucial role.\nThe discovery of this new quantum interference extended the quantum interference in solid materials from the single-particle transport process in single conductor to the multi-particle interactions between multiple conductors. Furthermore, compared with magnetoresistance correction in intralayer quantum interference, the magneto-drag resistance correction is significantly larger, providing a candidate for the future development of new-principle magnetic memory devices.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLijun Zhu et al, Signature of quantum interference effect in inter-layer Coulomb drag in graphene-based electronic double-layer systems, Nature Communications (2023).

   "text": "The field of integrated photonics has taken off in recent years. These microchips utilize light particles (photons) in their circuitry as opposed to the electronic circuits that, in many ways, form the backbone of our modern age. Offering improved performance, reliability, energy efficiency, and novel functionalities, integrated photonics has immense potential and is fast becoming a part of the infrastructure in data centers and telecom systems while also being a promising contender for a wide range of sensors and integrated quantum technologies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignificant improvements in nanoscale fabrication have made it possible to build photonic circuits with minimal defects, but defects can never be entirely avoided, and losses due to disorder remains a limiting factor in today's technology.\nMinimizing these losses could, for example, reduce the energy consumption in communication systems and further improve the sensitivity of sensor technology. And since photonic quantum technologies rely on encoding information in fragile quantum states, minimizing losses is essential to scale quantum photonics to real applications. So the search is on for new ways to reduce the backscattering or even prevent it entirely.\nA one-way street for photons is impossible today\nOne suggestion for minimizing the loss of photons in an integrated photonic system is to guide the light through the circuit using topological interfaces that prevent backscattering by design.\n\"It would be very nice if it were possible to reduce losses in these systems. But fundamentally, creating such a one-way street for photons is a tough thing to do. In fact, as of right now, it is impossible; to do this in the optical domain would require developing new materials that do not exist today,\" says Associate Professor S\u00f8ren Stobbe, Group Leader at DTU Electro.\nCircuitry built from topological insulators would, in theory, force photons to keep moving forward, never backwards. The backwards channel would simply not exist. While such effects are well-known in niche electronics and have been demonstrated with microwaves, they have yet to be shown in the optical domain.\nBut full topological protection is impossible in silicon and all other low-loss photonic materials because they are subject to time-reversal symmetry. This means that whenever a waveguide allows transmitting light in one direction, the backwards path is also possible. This means that there is no one-way street for photons in conventional materials, but researchers have hypothesized that a two-way street would already be good enough to prevent backscattering.\n\"There has been a lot of work trying to realize topological waveguides in platforms relevant to integrated photonics. One of the most interesting platforms is silicon photonics, which uses the same materials and technology that make up today's ubiquity of computer chips to build photonic systems, and even if disorder cannot be entirely eliminated, perhaps backscattering can,\" says S\u00f8ren Stobbe.\nNew experimental results from DTU recently published in Nature Photonics strongly suggest that with the materials available today, this likely will not happen.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nState-of-the-art waveguides offer no protection\nAlthough several previous studies have found that it may be possible to prevent backscattering based on various indirect observations, rigorous measurements of the losses and the backscattering in topological waveguides were so far missing. The central experiments conducted at DTU were performed on a highly well-characterized state-of-the-art type of silicon waveguide, showing that even in the best waveguides available, the topological waveguides show no protection against backscattering.\n\"We fabricated the best waveguide obtainable with current technology\u2014reporting the smallest losses ever seen and reaching minute levels of structural disorder\u2014but we never saw topological protection against backscattering. If the two-way topological insulators protect against backscattering, they would only be effective at disorder levels below what is possible today,\" says Ph.D.-student Christian Anker Rosiek.\nHe conducted most of the fabrication, experiments and data analysis along with postdoc Guillermo Arregui, both at DTU Electro.\n\"Measuring the losses alone is crucial, but not enough, because losses can also come from radiation out of the waveguide. We can see from our experiments that the photons get caught in little randomly located cavities in the waveguide as if many of tiny mirrors had been randomly placed in the light's path. Here, the light is reflected back and forth, scattering very strongly on those defects. It shows that the backscattering strength is high, even in a state-of-the-art system, proving that backscattering is the limiting factor,\" says Guillermo Arregui.\nWaveguide-material should break time-reversal symmetry\nThe study concludes that, for a waveguide to offer protection against backscattering, you would need the topological insulator to be constructed from materials that break time-reversal symmetry without absorbing light. Such materials do not exist today.\n\"We are not ruling out that protection from backscattering can work, and absence of evidence must not be confused with evidence of absence. There is plenty of exciting research to be explored within topological physics, but moving forward, I believe researchers should take great care in measuring losses when presenting new topological waveguides. That way, we will get a clearer picture of the true potential of these structures. Suppose someone does indeed develop new, exotic materials that allow only propagation in one direction; our study has established the tests needed to claim real protection against backscattering,\" says Christian Anker Rosiek.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristian Anker Rosiek et al, Observation of strong backscattering in valley-Hall photonic topological interface modes, Nature Photonics (2023).

Such materials are rare, and most metals and semiconductors change their electrical resistivity only by a tiny fraction of a percent at room temperature and in practically viable magnetic fields (typically, by less than a millionth of 1%). To observe a strong magnetoresistance response, researchers usually cool materials to liquid-helium temperatures so that electrons inside scatter less and can follow cyclotron trajectories.\nNow a research team led by Professor Sir Andre Geim has found that good old graphene that seemed to be studied in every detail over the last two decade exhibits a remarkably strong response, reaching above 100% in magnetic fields of standard permanent magnets (of about 1,000 Gauss). This is a record magnetoresistivity among all the known materials.\nSpeaking about this latest graphene discovery, Sir Andre Geim said, \"People working on graphene like myself always felt that this gold mine of physics should have been exhausted long ago. The material continuously proves us wrong finding yet another incarnation. Today I have to admit again that graphene is dead, long live graphene.\"\nTo achieve this, the researchers used high-quality graphene and tuned it to its intrinsic, virgin state where there were only charge carriers excited by temperature. This created a plasma of fast-moving Dirac fermions that exhibited a surprisingly high mobility despite frequent scattering. Both high mobility and neutrality of this Dirac plasma are crucial components for the reported giant magnetoresistance.\n\"Over the last 10 years, electronic quality of graphene devices has improved dramatically, and everyone seems to focus on finding new phenomena at low, liquid-helium temperatures, ignoring what happens under ambient conditions. This is perhaps not so surprising because the cooler your sample the more interesting its behavior usually becomes. We decided to turn the heat up and unexpectedly a whole wealth of unexpected phenomena turned up,\" says co-author Dr. Alexey Berdyugin.\nIn addition to the record magnetoresistivity, the researchers have also found that, at elevated temperatures, neutral graphene becomes a so-called \"strange metal.\" This is the name given to materials where electron scattering becomes ultimately fast, being determined only by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The behavior of strange metals is poorly understood and remains a mystery currently under investigation worldwide.\nThe Manchester work adds some more mystery to the field by showing that graphene exhibits a giant linear magnetoresistance in fields above a few Tesla, which is weakly temperature dependent. This high-field magnetoresistance is again record-breaking.\nThe phenomenon of linear magnetoresistance has remained an enigma for more than a century since it was first observed. The current Manchester work provides important clues about origins of the strange metal behavior and of the linear magnetoresistance. Perhaps, the mysteries can now be finally solved thanks to graphene as it represents a clean, well-characterized and relatively simple electronic system.\n\"Undoped high-quality graphene at room temperature offers an opportunity to explore an entirely new regime that in principle could be discovered even a decade ago but somehow was overlooked by everyone. We plan to study this strange-metal regime and, surely, more of interesting results, phenomena and applications will follow,\" adds Dr. Leonid Ponomarenko, one of the authors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAndre Geim, Giant magnetoresistance of Dirac plasma in high-mobility graphene, Nature (2023).

This ingenious system simulates the periodic motion of a particle in a crystal in order to study its behavior in the presence of interactions and dissipation. By creating a soliton, the researchers demonstrated the existence of permanent oscillations, despite the detrimental effects of dissipation.

In particular, extending these systems beyond their natural geometrical dimensionality is a growing field of research through the implementation of \"synthetic dimensions.\"\nSuch a synthetic space can be realized by exploiting the system's discrete degree of freedom, which, associated with a coupling mechanism, mimics the motion of a particle moving within a crystal lattice. An original way to create a synthetic dimension in photonics is to implement it in the frequency domain (wavelengths of light) through an optical resonator. The periodicity imposed by the cavity roundtrip time acts as an optical rule. One can then form the artificial lattice by coupling these frequency modes using an intracavity phase modulator.\nThe resulting synthetic dimension is very similar to that formed by a one-dimensional crystal, where atoms are coupled to their nearest neighbor. Therefore, we expect to observe phenomena from solid-state physics. Among others, synthetic dimensions have been exploited to observe Bloch oscillations\u2014the motion described by particles confined in a periodic potential when subjected to a constant force. This phenomenon\u2014worthy of the 1952 Nobel Prize in Physics\u2014is known to disappear when the system is dissipative or in the presence of interactions. In fact, they are not observed in solids.\nIn this context, researchers from two ULB laboratories, the Laboratoire interdisciplinaire Carnot de Bourgogne (Dijon), and the University of Auckland (NZ) have implemented a synthetic dimension with dissipation, dispersion and nonlinearity to study the fate of these oscillations. Thanks to the system's nonlinearity, the researchers were able to form a peculiar light pulse called a \"cavity soliton\" and observe permanent Bloch oscillations despite the dissipation.\nIn addition to being the first experimental demonstration of Bloch oscillations in that framework, the intrinsic properties of the cavity soliton allow both the extension of the synthetic dimension far beyond previous realizations thanks to the formation of a frequency comb and probing of the reciprocal space by virtue of its ultrashort temporal duration.\nThis discovery holds great potential for studying and modeling complex phenomena from condensed matter physics that are difficult to investigate in their natural environment. These results also pave the way for new applications, notably in topological photonics and for the generation of optical frequency combs.\nThe work is published in the journal Nature Physics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNicolas Englebert et al, Bloch oscillations of coherently driven dissipative solitons in a synthetic dimension, Nature Physics (2023).

Recently, studies to increase the resolution of X-ray imaging technology are being actively conducted in order to precisely observe the internal structure of semiconductors and batteries at the nanoscale.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA joint research team led by Professor YongKeun Park of the KAIST Department of Physics and Dr. Jun Lim of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory has succeeded in developing a core technology that can overcome the resolution limitations of existing X-ray microscopes.\nThis study, in which Dr. KyeoReh Lee participated as the first author, was published on April 6 in Light: Science and Applications. It is titled \"Direct high-resolution X-ray imaging exploiting pseudorandomness.\"\nX-ray nanomicroscopes do not have refractive lenses. In an X-ray microscope, a circular grating called a concentric zone plate is used instead of a lens. The resolution of an image obtained using the zone plate is determined by the quality of the nanostructure that constitutes the plate. There are several difficulties in fabricating and maintaining these nanostructures, which set the limit to the level of resolution for X-ray microscopy.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Fig. 2.

The middle panel shows the design of the X-ray diffuser, and there is an inset in the middle of the panel that shows a corresponding part of the SEM image. The right panel shows an experimental random X-ray diffraction pattern, also known as a speckle pattern, obtained from the X-ray diffuser. Credit: The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)\n             \n\n\nThe research team developed a new X-ray nanomicroscopy technology to overcome this problem. The X-ray lens proposed by the research team is in the form of numerous holes punched in a thin tungsten film, and generates random diffraction patterns by diffracting incident X-rays. The research team mathematically identified that, paradoxically, the high-resolution information of the sample was fully contained in these random diffraction patterns, and actually succeeded in extracting the information and imaging the internal states of the samples.\nThe imaging method using the mathematical properties of random diffraction was proposed and implemented in the visible light band for the first time by Dr. KyeoReh Lee and Professor YongKeun Park in 2016. This study uses the results of previous studies to solve the difficult, lingering problem in the field of the X-ray imaging.\nThe resolution of the image of the constructed sample has no direct correlation with the size of the pattern etched on the random lens used.

The flow is known as electricity, and it is harnessed to power and control everything from lightbulbs to the Large Hadron Collider.\nIn quantum matter, by contrast, electrons don't behave as they do in normal materials. They are much stronger and the four fundamental properties of electrons\u2014charge, spin, orbit and lattice\u2014become intertwined, resulting in complex states of matter.\n\"In quantum matter, electrons shed their particle-like character and exhibit strange collective behavior,\" says condensed matter physicist Arun Paramekanti, a professor in the U of T's department of physics in the Faculty of Arts & Science. \"These materials are known as non-Fermi liquids, in which the simple rules break down.\"\nNow, three researchers from the university's department of physics and Centre for Quantum Information & Quantum Control (CQIQC) have developed a theoretical model describing the interactions between subatomic particles in non-Fermi liquids. The framework expands on existing models and will help researchers understand the behavior of these \"strange metals.\"\nTheir research was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). The lead author is physics Ph.D. student Andrew Hardy, with co-authors Paramekanti and post-doctoral researcher Arijit Haldar.\n\"We know that the flow of a complex fluid like blood through arteries is much harder to understand than water through pipes,\" says Paramekanti. \"Similarly, the flow of electrons in non-Fermi liquids is much harder to study than that in simple metals.\"\nHardy adds, \"What we've done is construct a model, a tool, to study non-Fermi liquid behavior. And specifically, to deal with what happens when there is symmetry breaking, when there is a phase transition into a new type of system.\"\n\"Symmetry breaking\" is the term used to describe a fundamental process found in all of nature. Symmetry breaks when a system\u2014whether a droplet of water or the entire universe\u2014loses its symmetry and homogeneity and becomes more complex.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, a droplet of water is symmetrical no matter its orientation\u2014rotate it in any direction and it looks the same. But its symmetry is broken when it undergoes a phase transition and freezes into an ice crystal. As a snowflake, it is still symmetrical but only in six different directions.\nThe same thing happened with all subatomic particles and forces following the Big Bang. With the explosive birth of the cosmos, all particles and all the forces were the same, but symmetry breaking immediately transformed them into the manifold particles and forces we see in the cosmos today.\n\"Symmetry breaking in non-Fermi liquids is much more complicated to study because there isn't a comprehensive framework for working with non-Fermi liquids,\" says Hardy. \"Describing how this symmetry breaking occurs is hard to do.\"\nIn a non-Fermi liquid, interactions between electrons become much stronger when the particles are on the brink of symmetry breaking. As with a ball poised at the top of a hill, a very gentle nudge one way or the other will send it in opposite directions.\nThe new research provides insight into these transitions in non-Fermi liquids and could lead to new ways to tune and control the properties of quantum materials. While still a serious challenge for physicists, the work is important for the new quantum materials that could shape the next generation of quantum technology.\nThese technologies include high-temperature superconductors that achieve zero resistance at temperatures much closer to room temperature, making them much more practical and useful. There are also graphene devices\u2014technologies based on one-atom thick layers of carbon atoms which have a myriad of electronic applications.\n\"Quantum materials exhibit both unusual electron flow and complex types of symmetry breaking which can be controlled and tuned,\" Hardy says. \"It is exciting for us to be able to make theoretical predictions for such systems which can be tested in new experiments in the lab.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAndrew Hardy et al, Nematic phases and elastoresistivity from a multiorbital non-Fermi liquid, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

   "text": "Antineutrinos, the antimatter counterpart of neutrinos, have an almost non-existent mass and charge, and almost never interact with other particles, which makes them particularly difficult to detect. Physicists have been studying neutrinos from reactors for many years, typically using scintillator-based detectors.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese efforts led to significant physics discoveries, from the first detection of neutrinos in the late 1950s to recent measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters. As neutrinos hardly interact with other particles, they are generally hard to detect. Neutrinos produced in nuclear reactors are detected through the so-called inverse beta decay (IBD). This is a signal produced during nuclear reactions, which involve an electron antineutrino with a proton, producing a positron and a neutron.\nThe SNO+ experiment, a large-scale research effort collecting data using the multipurpose particle detector at SNOLAB, recently gathered the first evidence of reactor antineutrinos inside a water Cherenkov detector (i.e., a type of particle detector that detects radiation and reconstructs information about particles). Their paper, published in Physical Review Letters, could pave the way for new antineutrino searches using water Cherenkov detectors.\n\"The primary goal of the SNO+ experiment is to conduct a high-sensitivity search for neutrinoless double beta decay using a tellurium-loaded liquid scintillator,\" Logan Lebanowski told Phys.org on behalf of the SNO+ collaboration. \"With the detector currently filled with scintillator, SNO+ is also measuring the neutrino mass splitting \ud835\udeabm221 using reactor antineutrinos. Prior to this, the collaboration filled the detector with water to calibrate detector components and characterize intrinsic radioactive backgrounds.\"\nGiven that the SNO+ detector has a good enough sensitivity to measure reactor antineutrinos with a liquid scintillator, the SNO+ collaboration set out to explore the possibility that antineutrinos could also be observed using water. The detector also has the lowest reported rates of background-inducing muons from the atmosphere among water Cherenkov detectors, which significantly improved the team's chances of detecting antineutrinos.\nThe SNO+ detector is a large acrylic vessel, measuring 12m in diameter. At the time of the experiment, it was filled with ultra-pure water.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"This provides a large volume for particles coming in to interact and produce light,\" Christine Kraus explained. \"This light then can be recognized by Photomultipliers, we have ~9500 surrounding the acrylic vessel mounted on a steel structure. Photomultipliers convert the signal into an electrical one that can be processed. We then can determine energy and position of the event.\"\nWhen trying to detect antineutrinos from reactors, physicists are essentially searching for a unique signal known as \"coincidence signal,\" which clearly indicates the presence of anti-neutrinos. Kraus and the rest of the SNO+ collaboration specifically searched for this signal in data collected during a period of 190 days. To extract the signal, they conducted two independent analyses, which yielded consistent results.\n\"This worked for us\u2014a first in a water detector\u2014because our neutron detection efficiency is high,\" Lebanowski said. \"The neutron produced in an IBD captures on hydrogen in the water and produces a 2.2-MeV \ud835\udec4, regardless of the energy of the incident antineutrino. Therefore, the achievement of detecting the 2.2-MeV \ud835\udec4 with higher efficiency can impact a broad range of antineutrino searches and measurements made with pure water Cherenkov detectors.\"\nThe SNO+ collaboration was the first to detect antineutrinos in a water Cherenkov detector. They achieved this using ultra-pure water and minimizing natural radioactivity in the detector, which can produce confounding background events resembling the coincidence signal they were looking for. In the future, the result of this study and the methods employed by the SNO+ collaboration could inform additional antineutrino searches and measurements using pure water Cherenkov detectors.\n\"Observing reactor antineutrinos with pure water demonstrates that reactor antineutrinos can be observed with a target medium that is non-toxic, safe, easy to handle, and cheap, and therefore favorable for use anywhere and when desiring a large target,\" Lebanowski said. \"This analysis also demonstrates the ability of water Cherenkov detectors to make measurements at lower energies, and a strong ability to distinguish the signal from the radioactive backgrounds present in most detectors.\"\nA key reason why Cherenkov detectors can distinguish coincidence signals from unrelated background signals is that they provide an estimated direction for incident particles. This has not yet been achieved using scintillator detectors, which will be an area of focus for the SNO+ collaboration's future research.\n\"With the liquid scintillator we expect to have an even better signal for anti-neutrinos, not just from reactors but also from the natural radioactivity in the Earth itself\u2014so-called geo-neutrinos,\" Kraus added. \"They have been measured twice before\u2014first in Japan by the KAMLAND experiment and then in Europe by the Borexino experiment. We would be the first in North America and being located in the Canadian shield is interesting, because the structure is different from the two other locations.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA.

   "text": "Scientists working on laser application at the RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics (RAP) have employed a new technique using GHz bursts of femtosecond laser pulses grouped in MHz envelopes\u2014termed BiBurst mode\u2014to greatly increase the ablation speed of silicon without deterioration of ablation quality.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished in International Journal of Extreme Manufacturing (IJEM), the team led by the researchers from the Advanced Laser Processing Research Team has successfully increased the throughput of silicon microfabrication by ablation for practical applications using the BiBurst mode.\nThe team has demonstrated that the BiBurst mode can etch silicon at an ablation speed 23 times faster than the single-pulse mode without deterioration of ablation quality under conditions where air ionization is avoided. Enhancement of ablation speed is highly desirable to improve throughput for practical applications. Thus, these findings could have a great impact on not only fundamental scientists but also industrial people.\nIn the previous work, the team has reported that the BiBurst mode femtosecond laser pulses improve the ablation efficiency and quality of crystalline silicon as compared with the single-pulse mode. In the GHz bursts, femtosecond laser pulse trains with extremely short pulse-to-pulse intervals of several hundred picoseconds (ps) are incident, controlling temporal energy deposition on silicon to improve ablation efficiency and quality.\nThen, the team has further explored the capability of high throughput micromachining of silicon at significantly higher BiBurst pulse energy, which corresponds to the integrated energy of each pulse in the BiBurst pulse.\nImportantly, the energy of each femtosecond laser pulse (intra-pulse) in the BiBurst pulse is significantly smaller than the pulse energy for single-pulse mode when the same total laser energy was delivered. For the single-pulse mode, the ablated surface is seriously damaged at an intensity above the critical value due to air ionization. In contrast, BiBurst mode can deliver much higher total energy to ablate silicon without inducing air ionization due to its lower intra-pulse intensities.\nConsequently, the BiBurst mode achieves 23 times higher ablation speed due to the synergetic effect of higher total energy and higher ablation efficiency as compared with the single-pulse mode under the condition at which the air ionization is avoided. In addition, temporal control of energy deposition by the BiBurst can maintain the high ablation quality even at such a higher total energy.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe team has proposed that the higher ablation efficiency by GHz burst can be achieved by the collaborative contribution of successive intra-pulses. Specifically preceding intra-pulses in the burst produces transient absorption sites for the succeeding intra-pulses due to free electron generation to enhance the ablation efficiency.\nOn the other hand, the ablation efficiency gradually decreases as the intra-pulse energy exceeds the ablation threshold energy for the single-pulse mode, because individual intra-pulses can directly induce ablation. The enhanced ablation efficiency due to the collaborative contribution of successive intra-pulses is no longer expected in this regime.\nThe lower intra-pulse energy in the BiBurst mode can not only avoid air ionization but also maintain a higher ablation efficiency, thus achieving higher ablation speed than a single pulse of GHz burst or single-pulse mode.\nThus, BiBurst mode ablation has the potential to provide much higher throughput while maintaining high quality for practical applications of silicon micromachining.\nCorresponding author, Prof. Koji Sugioka, said that \"The first demonstration of GHz burst mode femtosecond laser ablation was implemented by Ilday's group in 2016. They showed that GHz burst mode ablation can improve ablation efficiency due to its efficient energy deposition (one order of magnitude higher). These results highly impacted the laser micro- and nano-processing community, and multiple research groups followed them to investigate GHz burst mode ablation.\"\n\"Although the ablation efficiency is one of the important factors for the practical use, higher ablation rate per pulse is more critical to improving the throughput. In principle, increasing the laser intensity increases the ablation rate. However, the higher intensity of femtosecond laser pulses often suffers from incidental damage due to air ionization and excessive heat generation.\"\n\"We have shown for the first time that GHz/MHz BiBurst mode of femtosecond laser has the possibility to significantly improve throughput without deterioration of ablation quality. We expect that the BiBurst mode femtosecond laser processing will rewrite the common sense of the femtosecond laser process to overcome bottlenecks in the industrial applications.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKotaro Obata et al, GHz bursts in MHz burst (BiBurst) enabling high-speed femtosecond laser ablation of silicon due to prevention of air ionization, International Journal of Extreme Manufacturing (2023).

   "text": "During intense rainstorms, residents of urban areas rely on stormwater sewers to keep streets and homes from flooding. But in some cases, air pockets in sewers combine with fast-moving water to produce waterspouts that can reach dozens of feet high and last for several minutes. These so-called storm geysers can flood the surrounding area, cause damage to nearby structures, injure bystanders, and compromise drainage pipes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers from Sichuan University, Ningbo University, University of Alberta, and Hohai University developed a computational model of stormwater piping to study storm geysers. They used this model to understand why storm geysers form, what conditions tend to make them worse, and what city planners can do to prevent them from occurring.\nThe article \"Modeling geysers triggered by an air pocket migrating with running water in a pipeline\" is authored by Xin Li, Jianmin Zhang, David Z. Zhu, and Shangtuo Qian. It will appear in Physics of Fluids on April 11, 2023.\nPerhaps the biggest cause of storm geysers is poor city planning. With extreme weather events becoming more common due to climate change, cities can often find themselves unprepared for massive amounts of rain. Growing cities are especially vulnerable. Small cities have small drainage pipes, but new streets and neighborhoods result in added runoff, and those small pipes may not be able to handle the increased volume.\n\"This can lead to pressurized flow and the potential for air pockets to become entrapped and transported through the pipeline,\" said author Jianmin Zhang, of Sichuan University. \"These air pockets can ultimately be discharged through maintenance holes, resulting in storm geysers.\"\nThe authors say the best cure for a storm geyser is bigger pipes.\n\"The most effective preventive measure for newly planned drainage pipelines is to increase the pipeline diameter and improve system design, which reduces the likelihood of full-flow conditions and eliminates storm geysers,\" said Zhang.\nHowever, that advice is little help to cities with existing pipeline infrastructure. In these systems, the focus must be on minimizing the potential damage by reducing the height of the geysers, the volume of expelled water, or the resulting damage to the pipeline.\n\"Scholars have proposed prevention measures such as increasing the maintenance hole diameter, using expansion segments in maintenance holes, installing orifice plates, and adding structures to allow air release while preventing the outflow of water,\" said Zhang. \"However, these measures often cannot achieve all of the aforementioned objectives simultaneously.\"\nWhile their model provides substantial guidance to city planners, the team hopes to expand their work to evaluate a range of prevention measures and identify the best overall solutions.\n\"We plan to systematically evaluate existing prevention measures that have received significant attention from scholars, analyze their advantages and disadvantages, and propose a comprehensive measure that achieves optimal results,\" said Zhang. \"Our ultimate goal is to apply this comprehensive approach in practical engineering applications to eliminate storm geysers.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tXin Li et al, Modelling Geysers Triggered by an Air Pocket Migrating with Running Water in a Pipeline, Physics of Fluids (2023).

   "text": "Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have developed chip-scale devices for simultaneously manipulating the color, focus, direction of travel, and polarization of multiple beams of laser light.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ability to tailor those properties using a single chip is essential for fabricating a new class of portable sensors that could measure such fundamental quantities as rotation, acceleration, time, and magnetic fields with unprecedented accuracy\u2014outside the confines of a laboratory.\nTypically, a laboratory bench as big as a dining room table is required to house the assortment of lenses, polarizers, mirrors, and other apparatus required to manipulate even a single beam of laser light. Yet many quantum technologies, including miniature optical atomic clocks and some future quantum computers, will require simultaneous access to multiple, widely varying laser colors within a small region of space.\nTo tackle the problem, NIST scientist Vladimir Aksyuk and his colleagues combined two chip-scale technologies: Integrated photonic circuits, which use tiny transparent channels and other microscale components to guide light; and a source of unconventional optics known as an optical metasurface. Such surfaces consist of glass wafers imprinted with millions of tiny structures, only a few hundred billionths of a meter in height, that manipulate the properties of light without the need for bulky optics.\nAksyuk and his collaborators demonstrated that a single photonic chip did the work of 36 optical components, simultaneously controlling the direction, focus, and polarization (the plane in which a light wave vibrates as it travels) of 12 laser beams divided among four distinct colors.\nThe team also showed that the tiny chip can direct two beams of different colors to travel alongside each other, a requirement for some types of advanced atomic clocks. They have reported their findings in the April 3 issue of Light: Science & Applications.\n\"Replacing an optical table full of bulky optical components with a simple semiconductor wafer that can be fabricated in the clean room is truly game-changing,\" said Amit Agrawal, a member of the NIST team. \"These kinds of technologies are needed since they are robust and compact and can be easily reconfigured for different experiments under real-world conditions,\" he added\nThe chip-based optical system is a work in progress, noted Aksyuk. For instance, the laser light is not yet powerful enough to cool atoms to the ultra-low temperatures required for a miniaturized advanced atomic clock. (Although laser light would ordinarily energize atoms, causing them to heat up and move faster, the opposite happens if the frequency and other properties of the light are chosen carefully. Upon striking the atoms, the laser photons induce the atoms to give up energy and cool down so that they can be trapped by a magnetic field.)\nEven without the cooling capability, the miniature optical system \"is a key stepping stone toward building an advanced atomic clock on a chip,\" Aksyuk said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChad Ropp et al, Integrating planar photonics for multi-beam generation and atomic clock packaging on chip, Light: Science & Applications (2023).

   "text": "Single-photon emitters are crucial building materials suited for optical quantum technologies. Among them, hexagonal boron nitride is a promising two-dimensional material that retains bright, room-temperature single-photon emitters. However, photo-instability is an existing challenge to facilitate applications of these properties in practice.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a new study published in Communications Materials, Sylvia Xin Li and a team of scientists at the department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Texas, RIKEN center for Advanced Photonics, and the University of Oxford, revealed the possibility of photobleaching hexagonal boron nitride vacancy emitters to facilitate photostability suited for quantum applications.\nDesigning quantum emitters\nQuantum mechanics can be harnessed for real-world applications as one of the most intriguing and fastest growing technologies exploring quantum states of photons for information processing and transmission. Researchers have investigated a variety of solid-state single photon sources in three-dimensional crystals; however, the light emanating from these sources can be contained by the surrounding bulky dielectric environment to cause reduced efficiency of emission.\nScientists can overcome this challenge of color centers in two-dimensional hosts such as transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitrides (hBN) via dielectric materials with significantly reduced thickness at the level of a single atomic layer to integrate with on-chip photonics. While single photon emission in transition metal dichalcogenides is only observed at room temperature, the material itself can host bright, room-temperature single-photon emitters to provide materials such as hexagonal boron nitride with unique photophysical properties to function at cryogenic temperatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Total intensity of P3 emission in the air. Since individual time-traces have discrete bleaching steps, the overall decay curves of total intensity are obtained by summing up N time-traces. Here, N\u2009=\u200931, 7, 19 and 6 for (a) monolayer CVD hBN, (b) multilayer CVD hBN, (c) liquid exfoliated hBN with type-I emission and (d) liquid exfoliated hBN with type-II emission, respectively. Red dashed lines and yellow dotted lines are fitting with one exponential decay function, and the sum of two exponential decay functions, respectively. From the one-exponential fitting with 95% confidence interval, the bleaching lifetime in monolayer CVD hBN is 6.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u2009s. From the two-exponential fitting with 95% confidence interval, two bleaching lifetimes are extracted for monolayer CVD hBN, multilayer CVD and liquid exfoliated hBN with type-I emission, which are 2.9\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 and 55\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2\u2009s, 11\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1 and 170\u2009\u00b1\u200920\u2009s, and 10\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6\u2009s and 220\u2009\u00b1\u200930\u2009s, respectively.

The team showed bleaching to be significantly reduced by a simple strategy of stacking additional monolayers of the compound on the material.\nThe scientists characterized the photobleached monolayer with annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy to achieve high-quality atomic scale imaging of the hBN lattice. They combined X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy to achieve high-quality atomic-scale imaging of the hexagonal boron nitride lattice.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Characterizing a bleached emitter with ADF-STEM.

The team transferred these samples into silicon dioxide substrates without any post-treatment and examined them with time-dependent photoluminescence measurements by using a custom-built confocal spectroscopic microscope.\nLi and colleagues focused on the emitter species observed in all hBN samples and noted the presence of three different emission behaviors in monolayer and multilayer chemical vapor deposition samples. Multilayer liquid exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride as-prepared without thermal annealing treatment showed two different emission modes of interest, which they characterized extensively.\nBleaching mechanisms in monolayer chemical vapor deposition hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)\nThe scientists studied the bleaching mechanisms of monolayer hBN emitters under a variety of atmospheres using a custom-built environmental chamber. They accomplished this by placing a monolayer sample of chemical vapor-deposition grown hexagonal boron nitride in a small sealed chamber with a quartz observation window and filled the gas chamber with a variety of gases, including nitrogen, oxygen and water vapor. Since many organic fluorophores are degraded with oxygen or water, the team filled the environmental chamber with nitrogen to minimize hydration.\nWhile the nitrogen atmosphere did not mitigate bleaching completely when the team conducted bleaching experiments in an oxygen-rich atmosphere, they noted its influence in the process of photobleaching. The scientists further examined bleaching mechanisms of the material via annular dark-field in the scanning transmission electron microscope (ADF-STEM).\n\n\n\n\n\n                Atomic compositions of VB monovacancies. A nomenclature is introduced to label the heteroatom substitutions, which enumerates an edge of the innermost three N atoms clockwise as 1 to 3 highlighted in bold type, and the remaining B and N atoms as 4 to 12. Credit: Communications Materials (2023).  DOI: 10.1038/s43246-023-00345-8\n             \n\n\nChemical analysis and thermal annealing effects\nLi and colleagues conducted X-ray photon spectroscopy to identify different elements and their chemical states with the materials in contrast to elemental analysis with inductively coupled plasma techniques. To accomplish this, they first sputtered the sample surfaces with an argon ion beam to remove any adsorbed hydrocarbons. As the timeframe of Argon sputtering increased, the atomic concentration of carbon on the multilayer surface decreased to reach a stable value. The outcomes were consistent with ADF-STEM imaging outcomes of the monolayer compound.\nWith higher surface carbon concentrations, the researchers grew atomic layers of hybridized boron nitride and graphene domains with methane and ammonia borane as precursors. They then synthesized hBN from a lab-built, low-pressure chemical vapor deposition reactor with typical hBN crystals of triangular shape, and observed the materials with scanning electron microscopy. The team also noted the presence of polygonal sheets in similar regions, which they credited to the presence of graphene by analyzing the regions with Raman spectroscopy.\n\n\n\n\n\n                XPS characterization of different hBN samples and annealing effect on liquid exfoliated hBN. XPS spectra of hBN samples that are pre-cleaned with Ar ion sputtering, showing B 1\u2009s (a, d), N 1\u2009s (b, e), and C 1\u2009s (c, f). While (a) to (c) represent multilayer CVD hBN, (d) to (f) are results of multilayer liquid exfoliated hBN. The C concentration is higher in the CVD sample, mainly in the form of sp2 C-C, which corresponds to graphene domains. Note that C-N is different from C-(N)3, with details in Supplementary Fig. 18 and Supplementary Table 3. g Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of type-I emission in liquid exfoliated hBN, before (pink) and after (yellow) annealing at 850\u2009\u02daC in Ar for 30\u2009min. h PL spectra of type-II emission in liquid exfoliated hBN, with sharper zero-phonon lines (ZPLs), before and after annealing at 850\u2009\u02daC in Ar for 30\u2009min. i Number of each emitter species Pi (i\u2009=\u20091, 2, 3, 4) in liquid exfoliated hBN, before (left bars) and after (right bars) 850\u2009\u02daC annealing in Ar. Pink and yellow colors indicate broad ZPLs, corresponding to type-I emission. Blue and green indicate sharp ZPLs, corresponding to type-II emission. Before annealing, P3 has a large percentage of type-I emitters, which disappear almost completely after annealing. All type-II emitters remain the same after annealing, regardless of the emission species Pi (i\u2009=\u20091, 2, 3, 4). Credit: Communications Materials (2023).  DOI: 10.1038/s43246-023-00345-8\n             \n\n\nOutlook\nIn this way, Sylvia Xin Li and a research team in engineering, chemistry and photonics, identified a key to improve the photostability of emitters in hexagonal boron nitride materials that effectively shielded oxygen from the environment to optimize carbon substitution in the hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) lattice. They noted photobleaching of hBN emitters to be in direct contact with air, and dominated by photochemical reactions emitting defects with oxygen. The team mitigated the effects of bleaching by shielding molecular oxygen and by introducing a nitrogen atmosphere, or by stacking additional hexagonal boron nitride layers on the material.\nThis strategy improved the average emitter lifetime by about 20 times. The team compared the experimental results across a range of imaging methods and thermal annealing to verify the outcomes to provide in-depth insights to the structural origins of hBN quantum emission. The knowledge gained about defect engineering hexagonal boron nitride will be insightful across broader fields of study to tune the electric properties of materials within 2D integrated devices and in 2D quantum materials for future sensing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSylvia Xin Li et al, Prolonged photostability in hexagonal boron nitride quantum emitters, Communications Materials (2023).

   "text": "One way to reduce the damage caused by avalanches in the mountains is to place obstacles in their path. These obstacles can be artificial barriers or natural forests. Knowing how the avalanche interacts with obstacles is essential to mitigate the damage from snow avalanches as well as other hazardous geophysical granular flows such as debris flows or mudslides.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe (a team of researchers from the laboratory FAST in Paris-Saclay University) were inspired by this issue and developed a model experiment on a smaller scale to investigate the interaction between a granular material flowing down an inclined plane and a forest of pillars. Our plane is about one meter long and half a meter wide and is covered by a forest of pillars, typically 2 mm in diameter and with a regular spacing of 1 cm. The grains used are glass beads of 0.5 mm diameter, like sand but spherical in shape.\nWe deduce the instantaneous flow rate from a balance connected to a computer which gives the weight of the grains falling at the end of the plane as a function of time. The thickness of the flow is controlled upstream by fine-tuning the opening of the feed tank and is measured downstream from an inclined laser sheet.\nWith this setup, we measured the steady flow rate of grains that establishes through the forest of pillars for different slope inclinations, thicknesses of the granular layer and, most importantly, distances between the pillars. Our measurements show that the flow rate of grains increases with the slope angle, and the layer thickness and decreases with the density of pillars present in the incline.\nSurprisingly, the presence of pillars reduces the granular flow rate in a non-trivial way, while in the absence of pillars, the granular flow rate increases rapidly with the layer thickness; at large density of pillars, the granular flow rate becomes virtually independent of the thickness of the granular layer. Thus, the presence of pillars significantly modifies the dependency of the granular flow rate with the parameter of the experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Granular flow through a forest of pillar. Credit: University Paris-Saclay / FAST\n             \n\n\nThen we developed a theoretical model to rationalize their observations. The flow of grains is considered through a depth-averaged approach and the classical \u03bc(I) rheology which has been introduced to describe dense granular flows. In addition, we considered an expression for the force applied by each pillar on the granular layer and added the contribution of each pillar to obtain an average estimate of their effects.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThis approach gives predictions in good agreement with the observations in the wide range of parameters studied in this project. This means that we are now able to predict the effect of multiple obstacles present in the path of a granular flow. By transposing the predictions of this model to an avalanche of material one meter thick through a forest of trees 20 cm in diameter, we predict that the presence of a forest attenuates the avalanche if the spacing between trees is less than 3 meters. We have published our research in the journal Physical Review Fluids.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Granular flow through around a single pillar. Credit: University Paris-Saclay / FAST\n             \n\n\nThis study corresponds to a first step in characterizing the interaction between a granular flow running down a slope and a forest of obstacles. Several points can be explored to improve the description of this interaction between the avalanche and the obstacles. We should go beyond the average approach and observe how the presence of obstacles modifies the granular flow locally, in their vicinity.\nWe also need to study the effect of the spatial distribution of pillars on the attenuation of the granular flow. Another possible stage of investigation will be to characterize the effect of cohesion of the grains on the global flow.

   "text": "The next generation of quantum devices requires high-coherence qubits that are less error-prone. Responding to this need, researchers at the AQT at Berkeley Lab, a state-of-the-art collaborative research laboratory, developed a blueprint for a novel quantum processor based on \"fluxonium\" qubits. Fluxonium qubits can outperform the most widely used superconducting qubits, offering a promising path toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn collaboration with researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, and Yale University, the AQT team pioneered a systematic theoretical study of how to engineer fluxonium qubits for higher performance while offering practical suggestions to adapt and build the cutting-edge hardware that will fully harness the potential of quantum computing. Their results were published in the journal PRX Quantum.\nOn the leading edge of superconducting processors \nSuperconducting quantum processors consist of multiple qubits designed to have different transition frequencies facilitating precise control of individual qubits and their interactions. The transmon qubit, one of the most widely used in the field for superconducting processors, typically has low anharmonicity. Anharmonicity is the difference between relevant transition frequencies in a qubit. Low anharmonicity contributes to spectral crowding (when qubit frequencies are close to resonating with each other), making the processor more difficult to control since qubit frequencies are arranged tightly together.\nIn contrast, high anharmonicity allows researchers to have better qubit control because there's less overlap between the frequencies that control the qubits and those that drive any given qubit to higher energy levels. The fluxonium qubit has inherent advantages for complex superconducting processors, such as high anharmonicity, long coherence times, and simple control.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Project Scientist Long B.

Credit: Monica Hernandez/Berkeley Lab\n             \n\n\nBuilding on AQT's robust research and development history on superconducting circuits, the team leading the fluxonium-based architecture focused on the scalability and adaptability of the processor's main components, with a set of parameters that researchers can tune to increase the runtime and fidelity of quantum circuits. Some of these adaptations allow simpler operation of the system. Researchers proposed, for example, controlling the fluxonium qubits at low frequency (1-GHz) via microwave pulses directly generated by an electrical arbitrary waveform generator. This straightforward approach allows researchers to design processors and set up multiple qubits flexibly.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nFlexible approaches with fluxonium qubits for large-scale devices\nLong B. Nguyen is a project scientist at AQT and the paper's lead author. Nguyen started researching alternative superconducting qubits as a University of Maryland graduate student working with Professor Vladimir Manucharyan. Manucharyan introduced fluxonium qubits to the field just a decade earlier, and in 2019 Nguyen demonstrated the possible longer coherence times with fluxonium circuits. The fluxonium circuit is composed of three elements: a capacitor, a Josephson Junction, and a superinductor, which helps suppress magnetic flux noise\u2014a typical source of unwanted interference that affects superconducting qubits and causes decoherence.\n\"I always wanted to study new physics, and I focused on fluxonium because it appeared to be a better alternative to the transmon at the time. It has three circuit elements that I could play with to get the type of spectra I wanted. It could be designed to evade decoherence due to material imperfections. I also recently realized that scaling up fluxonium is probably more favorable since the estimated fabrication yield is high, and the interactions between individual qubits can be engineered to have high-fidelity,\" explained Nguyen.\nTo estimate and validate the performance of the proposed fluxonium blueprint, the team at AQT, in collaboration with the paper's researchers, simulated two types of programmable quantum logic gates\u2014the cross-resonance controlled-NOT (CNOT) and the differential ac-Stark controlled-Z (CZ). The high fidelities resulting from the gates' simulation across the range of proposed qubit parameters validated the team's expectations for the suggested blueprint.\n\"We provided a potential path towards building fluxonium processors with standard, practical procedures to deploy logic gates with varying frequencies.

   "text": "A magnetic cage keeps the more than 100 million degree Celsius hot plasmas in nuclear fusion devices at a distance from the vessel wall so that they do not melt. Now researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) have found a way to significantly reduce this distance. This could make it possible to build smaller and cheaper fusion reactors for energy production. The work was published in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe international experimental reactor ITER, which is currently being built in southern France, represents the most advanced way to generate energy in a fusion power plant. The design follows the tokamak principle, i.e., a fusion plasma at more than 100 million degrees is confined in a magnetic field shaped like a donut. This concept prevents the hot plasma from coming into contact with the enclosing wall and damaging it. The ASDEX Upgrade tokamak experiment at IPP in Garching near Munich serves as a blueprint for ITER and later fusion power plants. Important elements for ITER were developed here. And plasma operating conditions and components for later power plants can already be tested today.\nThe hot plasma moves closer to the divertor\nA central element of ASDEX Upgrade and all modern magnetic fusion facilities is the divertor. This is a part of the vessel wall that is particularly heat-resistant and requires an elaborate design. \"At the divertor arrives the heat from the plasma at the wall. In later power plants, the fusion product helium-4 will also be extracted there,\" Prof. Ulrich Stroth explained, head of the Plasma Edge and Wall Division at IPP. \"In this region, the wall load is particularly high.\" The divertor tiles of ASDEX Upgrade and also of ITER are therefore made of tungsten, the chemical element with the highest melting temperature of all (3422\u00b0C).\nWithout countermeasures, 20% of the fusion power of the plasma would reach the divertor surfaces. At approx. 200 megawatts per square meter, that would be roughly the same conditions as on the surface of the sun. However, the divertor in ITER and also future fusion power plants will only be able to cope with a maximum of 10 megawatts per square meter. For this reason, small amounts of impurities (often nitrogen) are added to the plasma. These extract most of its thermal energy by converting it into ultraviolet light. Nevertheless, the plasma edge (the separatrix) must be kept at a distance from the divertor to protect it. In ASDEX Upgrade until now, this has been at least 25 centimeters (measured from the lower plasma tip\u2014the X-point\u2014to the edges of the divertor).\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nX-point radiator opens up new possibilities for fusion reactor design\nNow, researchers at IPP have succeeded in reducing this distance to fewer than 5 centimeters without damaging the wall. \"We specifically use the X-point radiator for this, a phenomenon we discovered about a decade ago during experiments at ASDEX Upgrade,\" IPP researcher Dr. Matthias Bernert said. \"The X-point radiator occurs in specifically shaped magnetic cages when the amount of added nitrogen exceeds a certain value.\"\nThis leads to formation of a small, dense volume that radiates particularly strongly in the UV range. \"Such impurities give us somewhat poorer plasma properties, but if we set the X-point radiator to a fixed position by varying the nitrogen injection, we can run the experiments at higher power without damaging the device/divertor,\" Dr. Bernert explained.\nIn camera images from the vacuum vessel, the X-point radiator (XPR for short) can be seen as a blue glowing ring in the plasma, as it also emits some visible light in addition to the UV radiation. IPP researchers have recently intensively investigated the XPR. Nevertheless, chance also played a role in the current discovery: \"We accidentally moved the plasma edge much closer to the divertor than we had intended,\" IPP physicist Dr. Tilmann Lunt said.\n\"We were very surprised that ASDEX Upgrade coped with this without any problems.\" Because the effect could be confirmed in further experiments, the researchers now know: when the X-point radiator is present, significantly more thermal energy is converted into UV radiation than previously assumed. The plasma then radiates up to 90% of the energy in all directions.\nFusion power plants could be built more compact and cheaper\nThis leads to conclusions that could be very favorable for the construction of future fusion power plants:\nDivertors can be built smaller and technologically much simpler than before (Compact Radiative Divertor).Because the plasma moves closer to the divertor, the vacuum vessel volume can be better utilized. Initial calculations show that if the vessel were optimally shaped, it would be possible to almost double the plasma volume while maintaining the same dimensions. This would also increase the achievable fusion power. But the researchers first have to verify this in further experiments.\nIn addition, the use of the X-point radiator also helps against edge localized modes (ELMs): violent energy eruptions at the plasma edge that recur at regular intervals and expel about a tenth of the plasma energy towards the wall. ITER and future fusion reactors would be damaged by such eruptions.\n\"We are dealing with a significant discovery in fusion research,\" is therefore also the verdict of IPP Division Director Ulrich Stroth. \"The X-point radiator opens up completely new possibilities for us in the development of a power plant. We will further investigate the theory behind it and try to understand it better by new experiments at ASDEX Upgrade.\" The Garching tokamak will soon be ideally equipped for this: By summer 2024, it will be provided with a new upper divertor. Its special coils will make it possible to deform the magnetic field close to the divertor freely and thus also optimize the conditions for the X-point radiator.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tT.

But physicists often observe interesting properties in materials in which electrons strongly interact with each other. In these materials, the electrons often collectively behave as particles, giving rise to \"quasiparticles.\"\n\"A crystal can be thought of like an alternative universe with different laws of physics that allow different fundamental particles to live there,\" says Christopher Butler of the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science.\nButler and colleagues examined a crystal in which a layer of nickel atoms was arranged in a square lattice, like a chessboard. Individual electrons have a small mass, but within this crystal, they appeared as massless quasiparticles.\nThe team set out to examine this odd effect using a scanning tunneling microscope, but this proved challenging. The walnut-sized microscope is housed inside a vacuum chamber, surrounded by a roomful of equipment that creates low temperatures and ultralow pressures comparable to that at the surface of the moon.\n\"To examine the pristine surface of these crystals, we try to cleave off a small flake, much as geologists do,\" says Butler. \"But we have to do this inside the vacuum, and these crystals are so brittle they are prone to explode into dust.\"\nAfter numerous attempts, they succeeded and used the microscope to scan the flake with a small needle\u2014like a record player\u2014with a voltage across it. Varying the voltage allowed them to probe different features.\nThe team confirmed the nickel atoms were arranged in a chessboard-like arrangement. But to their surprise, the electrons had broken this pattern and were instead aligned in stripes (Fig. 1). This is called nematicity\u2014where interactions in the system make the electrons display less symmetry than the underlying material.\nButler likens the discovery to standing by a pond and throwing in a pebble. \"You'd expect to see circular ripples, so if you saw ripples appearing in parallel lines, you would know something weird is going on,\" he says. \"It demands an explanation.\"\nSuch experiments will help physicists test different proposed theories for the behavior of quantum systems with many particle interactions, such as high-temperature superconductors. These new results, for instance, fit with predictions made using a \"density-wave\" framework proposed by the study's co-authors at Nagoya University in Japan.\n\"The behavior of many interacting electrons is hard to predict even with supercomputers,\" says Butler. \"But at least we can observe what they are doing under a microscope.\"\nThe findings are published in the the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristopher John Butler et al, Correlation-driven electronic nematicity in the Dirac semimetal BaNiS 2, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2022).

   "text": "Researchers at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI) in Vienna recently devised a universal mechanism to invert the evolution of a qubit with a high probability of success. This protocol, outlined in Physical Review Letters, can propagate any target qubit back to the state it was in at a specific time in the past.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe introduction of this protocol builds on a previous paper published in 2020, where the same team presented a series of time translating protocols that could be applied in uncontrolled settings. While some of these protocols were promising, in most tested scenarios their probability of success was found to be too small. In their new study, the researchers thus set out to create an alternative protocol with a higher probability of success.\n\"Our newly developed protocol inverts the unitary evolution of a qubit,\" David Trillo, one of the researchers who carried out the study together with Benjamin Dive and Miguel Navascu\u00e9s, told Phys.org. \"A qubit (or quantum bit) is a two-level quantum system that serves as the quantum equivalent of bits used in quantum computers. Any quantum system has some natural evolution in time that needs to be controlled or at least accounted for when designing physical processes around them (e.g., when building a quantum computer). Our protocol takes a qubit and outputs the same system, but in the state that it would be in if it had evolved backwards in time.\"\nThe protocol created by Trillo and his colleagues is universal, which means that it can be applied to any qubit, irrespective of its natural time evolution or what state it is when the protocol is used. Universal protocols are inherently probabilistic, meaning that they cannot succeed all the time, but rather have a certain probability of success.\nIn initial evaluations, the researchers found that their universal quantum rewinding mechanism has a high probability of success, namely of 1. Essentially, the protocol works by setting a target qubit on a superposition of flight paths and then performing a series of quantum operations on it.\n\"Our protocol works for uncontrolled systems, or in other words qubits on which we don't know how to apply particular transformations,\" Trillo explained. \"Its cool new feature is that, whenever it fails, we can correct the failure and drive the system to the desired state. By adaptively performing these corrections, we can make the probability of success as high as we want, at the cost of increasing the running time of the protocol.\"\nThe new universal protocol introduced by Trillo and his colleagues allows researchers to rewind any given qubit in an uncontrolled setting with a high probability of success. While protocols that could achieve this in controlled settings already existed, unlocking the ability to propagate individual qubits in uncontrolled environments to a previous state could open new valuable possibilities for research.\n\"One wonders what other phenomena from the controlled setting we can transfer to an uncontrolled one,\" Trillo added. \"Ideally, we would like to generalize this protocol to higher dimensional systems. This seems to be quite challenging though, as new ideas are needed for this. We are also looking into improving the success probability of the other protocols in the original paper, particularly SWAP protocols.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tD.

However, solving these equations, critical for fields from materials engineering to drug design, requires a prohibitively long computational time for complex molecules and materials.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering (PME) and Department of Chemistry have explored the possibility of solving these electronic structures using a quantum computer.\nThe research, which uses a combination of new computational approaches, was published online in the Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation. It was supported by Q-NEXT, a DOE National Quantum Information Science Research Center led by Argonne, and by the Midwest Integrated Center for Computational Materials (MICCoM).\n\"This is an exciting step toward using quantum computers to tackle challenging problems in computational chemistry,\" said Giulia Galli, who led the research with Marco Govoni, a staff scientist at Argonne and member of the UChicago Consortium for Advanced Science and Engineering (CASE).\nA computational challenge\nPredicting the electronic structure of a material involves solving complex equations that determine how electrons interact, as well as modeling how various possible structures compare to each other in their overall energy levels.\nUnlike conventional computers that store information in binary bits, quantum computers use qubits that can exist in superposition of states, letting them solve certain problems more easily and quickly. Computational chemists have debated whether and when quantum computers might eventually be able to tackle the electronic structure problem of complex materials better than conventional computers. However, today's quantum computers remain relatively small and produce noisy data.\nEven with these weaknesses, Galli and her colleagues wondered whether they still could make progress in creating the underlying quantum computational methods required to solve electronic structure problems on quantum computers.\n\"The question we really wanted to address is what is possible to do with the current state of quantum computers,\" Govoni said. \"We asked the question: Even if the results of quantum computers are noisy, can they still be useful to solve interesting problems in materials science?\"\nAn iterative process\nThe researchers designed a hybrid simulation process, using IBM quantum computers. In their approach, a small number of qubits\u2014between four and six\u2014perform part of the calculations, and the results are then further processed using a classical computer.\n\"We designed an iterative computational process that takes advantages of the strengths of both quantum and conventional computers,\" said Benchen Huang, a graduate student in the Galli Group and first author of the new paper.\nAfter several iterations, the simulation process was able to provide the correct electronic structures of several spin defects in solid-state materials. In addition, the team developed a new error mitigation approach to help control for the inherent noise generated by the quantum computer and ensure accuracy of the results.\nHints at the future\nFor now, the electronic structures solved using the new quantum computational approach could already be solved using a conventional computer. Therefore, the longstanding debate of whether a quantum computer can be superior to a classical one in solving electronic structure problems is not settled yet.\nHowever, the results provided by the new method pave the way for quantum computers to address more complex chemical structures.\n\"When we scale this up to 100 qubits instead of 4 or 6, we think we might have an advantage over conventional computers,\" Huang said. \"But only time will tell for sure.\"\nThe research group plans to keep improving and scaling up their approach, as well as using it to solve different types of electronic problems, such as molecules in the presence of solvents, and molecules and materials in excited states.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBenchen Huang et al, Quantum Simulations of Fermionic Hamiltonians with Efficient Encoding and Ansatz Schemes, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation (2023).

In this study, the research team combined quantum sensing of solid-state systems with micro/nano resolution and deep subwavelength localization of electromagnetic fields to develop high-sensitivity microwave detection and high-precision microwave positioning technology.\nThe researchers designed a composite microwave antenna composed of diamond spin quantum sensors and metal nanostructures, which collects and converges microwave signals propagating in free space into nano-space. By probing the solid-state quantum probe state in the local domain, they measured the microwave signals. The method converted the detection of weak signals in free space into the detection of electromagnetic field and solid-state spin interactions at the nanoscale, improving the microwave signal measurement sensitivity of solid-state quantum sensors by 3\u20134 orders of magnitude.\nTo further utilize the high sensitivity microwave detection to achieve high-precision microwave localization, the researchers built a microwave interferometry device based on the diamond quantum sensor, and obtained the phase of the reflected microwave signal and the position information of the object through the solid-state spin detection of the interference result between the reflected microwave signal and the reference signal of the object. Based on the coherent interaction between solid-state spin quantum probes and microwave photons multiple times, they achieved quantum-enhanced position measurement with an accuracy of 10 micrometers (about one ten-thousandth of the wavelength).\nCompared with traditional radar systems, this quantum measurement method does not require active devices such as amplifiers at the detection end, reducing the impact of electronic noise and other factors on the measurement limit. Subsequent research will allow further improvement of radio localization accuracy, sampling rate, and other indicators based on solid-state spin quantum sensing, and the development of practical solid-state quantum radar localization technology that exceeds the performance level of existing radars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tXiang-Dong Chen et al, Quantum enhanced radio detection and ranging with solid spins, Nature Communications (2023).

It must also be ensured that these photons all have the same color, i.e., the same frequency. Fulfilling these requirements has been impossible until now.\nResearchers in the \"Integrated Quantum Photonics\" group led by Prof. Dr. Tim Schr\u00f6der at Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin have succeeded for the first time worldwide in generating and detecting photons with stable photon frequencies emitted from quantum light sources, or, more precisely, from nitrogen-vacancy defect centers in diamond nanostructures.\nThis was enabled by carefully choosing the diamond material; sophisticated nanofabrication methods carried out at the Joint Lab Diamond Nanophotonics of the Ferdinand-Braun-Institut, Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr H\u00f6chstfrequenztechnik; and specific experimental control protocols. By combining these methods, the noise of the electrons, which previously disturbed data transmission, can be significantly reduced, and the photons are emitted at a stable (communication) frequency.\n\n\n\n\n\n                NV in the dark (regime 3).

These structures are 1,000 times thinner than a human hair and make it possible to transfer emitted photons in a directed manner into glass fibers.\nHowever, during the fabrication of the nanostructures, the material surface is damaged at the atomic level, and free electrons create uncontrollable noise for the generated light particles. Noise, comparable to an unstable radio frequency, causes fluctuations in the photon frequency, preventing successful quantum operations such as entanglement.\nA special feature of the diamond material used is its relatively high density of nitrogen impurity atoms in the crystal lattice. These possibly shield the quantum light source from electron noise at the surface of the nanostructure. \"However, the exact physical processes need to be studied in more detail in the future,\" explains Laura Orphal-Kobin, who investigates quantum systems together with Prof. Dr. Tim Schr\u00f6der.\nThe conclusions drawn from the experimental observations are supported by statistical models and simulations, which Dr. Gregor Pieplow from the same research group is developing and implementing together with the experimental physicists.\nThe paper is published in the journal Physical Review X.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLaura Orphal-Kobin et al, Optically Coherent Nitrogen-Vacancy Defect Centers in Diamond Nanostructures, Physical Review X (2023).

   "text": "Developed at Harvard, and successfully tested at Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), a revolutionary new meta-optics for microscopes with extremely high spatial and temporal resolution has proven its functional ability in laboratory tests at the Institute of Experimental Physics at TU Graz.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicroscopes using this kind of lens promise completely new research and development approaches, especially in semiconductor and solar cell technology. The research team from Graz and Boston currently reports on the construction and the successful laboratory experiment with this new meta-optics in the journal Science.\nThe lens of the microscope has made it possible to use extreme ultraviolet radiation for the first time. Its extremely short wavelength enables it to follow ultra-fast physical processes in the attosecond range. For example, real-time images from the inside of modern transistors or the interaction of molecules and atoms with light. Marcus Ossiander came up with the idea for the novel lens during his research work in Federico Capasso's group at Harvard University, and since January 2023, the ERC Starting Grant and FWF START Award winner has been conducting research at the Institute of Experimental Physics at TU Graz.\nJoint success for Boston and Graz\nAttosecond physics uses extreme ultraviolet light. Because this light oscillates quickly and all the materials in the construction kit of optics development are opaque to this light, there have been no usable imaging systems for it until now. Marcus Ossiander remarks, \"I asked myself whether the classical principle of optics could not be reversed. Can you use the absence of material in small areas as the basis of an optical element?\"\nThe lens developed at Harvard on the basis of this idea and successfully tested at TU Graz implements this design principle. A precisely calculated arrangement of tiny holes in an extremely thin silicon foil conducts and focuses the incident attosecond light. A remarkable observation of the research team is that these vacuum tunnels transmit more light energy than should be possible due to the hole-covered surface. This means that the innovative meta-optics literally sucks the ultraviolet light into the focal point.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nHoles of a few nanometers in diameter\nExtremely small and precisely controlled structures are required for this breakthrough. Their production is close to the limits of what is technically feasible today. The technical implementation was achieved by Federico Capasso's team at Harvard, which is the world leader in this field, after an experimental phase of around two years.\nProof of functionality was achieved in collaboration with TU Graz, where Martin Schultze's group at the Institute of Experimental Physics is dedicated to the generation and application of ultra-short ultraviolet light flashes. \"This is a great success for the cooperation between Boston and Graz. Now we want to use it to study microelectronics, nanoparticles and similar things soon,\" explains Marcus Ossiander.\nThe meta-optics consists of an approximately 200-nanometer-thin film into which tiny hole structures have been etched. The entire lens consists of many hundreds of millions of holes; there are about ten of these structures per micrometer on the membrane. A single hole measures between 20 and 80 nanometers in diameter. For comparison: a human hair is about 60 to 100 micrometers thick, a small virus has a diameter of 15 nanometers. The diameters of the holes vary and decrease from the center of the membrane outwards. Depending on the size of the hole, the incident light radiation there is delayed and thus collapses into a tiny focal point.\nLaser meets gas cloud\nTo measure the new type of lens, Martin Schultze and Hana Hampel from the Institute of Experimental Physics at TU Graz have unique expertise in generating the necessary extreme ultraviolet radiation. \"Reliably generating short light pulses with high energy requires precise control of light-controlled atomic processes and very precise optical set-ups. For this project, we have developed a light source that is particularly efficient in generating radiation of the wavelength for which these meta-optics were designed,\" says Martin Schultze.\nIn the experimental set-up in Graz, where a laser was focused into an inert gas jet, the extreme ultraviolet radiation could be generated and concentrated in very short pulses. The effectiveness of the meta-optics was proved by means of this light source which was optimized for attosecond physics.\nNext step: A microscope with meta-optics\nThe development of a microscope that works with this lens is now the next step. The possible applications for the new research field of attosecond microscopy are manifold. Semiconductor and solar cell technology in particular will benefit from the possibility of being able to track the ultrafast movement of charge carriers in space and time for the first time.\nIn modern transistors and optoelectronic circuits, the relevant processes take place within a few nanometers of spatial expansion and in a time frame of a few attoseconds. The new meta-optics will make it possible to watch these central components of information technology at work and optimize them even further.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarcus Ossiander et al, Extreme ultraviolet metalens by vacuum guiding, Science (2023).

This diffractive network-based multispectral imager is optimized using deep learning to spatially separate the input spectral channels onto distinct pixels at the output image plane, serving as a virtual spectral filter array that preserves the spatial information of the input scene or objects, instantaneously yielding an image cube without image reconstruction algorithms.\nTherefore, this diffractive multispectral imaging network can virtually convert a monochrome image sensor into a snapshot multispectral imaging device without conventional spectral filters or digital algorithms.\nPublished in Light: Science & Applications, the diffractive network-based multispectral imager framework is reported to offer both high spatial imaging quality and high spectral signal contrast.

   "text": "When any matter is divided into smaller and smaller pieces, eventually all you are left with\u2014when it cannot be divided any further\u2014is a particle. Currently, there are 12 different known elementary particles, which in turn are made up of quarks and leptons, each of which come in six different flavors. These flavors are grouped into three generations\u2014each with one charged and one neutral lepton\u2014to form different particles, including the electron, muon, and tau neutrinos. In the Standard Model, the masses of the three generations of neutrinos are represented by a three-by-three matrix.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA research team led by Professor Naoyuki Haba from the Osaka Metropolitan University Graduate School of Science, analyzed the collection of leptons that make up the neutrino mass matrix. Neutrinos are known to have less difference in mass between generations than other elementary particles, so the research team considered that neutrinos are roughly equal in mass between generations. They analyzed the neutrino mass matrix by randomly assigning each element of the matrix. They showed theoretically, using the random mass matrix model that the lepton flavor mixings are large. Their findings were published in Progress of Theoretical and Experimental Physics.\n\"Clarifying the properties of elementary particles leads to the exploration of the universe and ultimately to the grand theme of where we came from,\" Professor Haba explained. \"Beyond the remaining mysteries of the Standard Model, there is a whole new world of physics.\"\nAfter studying the neutrino mass anarchy in the Dirac neutrino, seesaw, double seesaw models, the researchers found that the anarchy approach requires that the measure of the matrix should obey the Gaussian distribution. Having considered several models of light neutrino mass where the matrix is composed of the product of several random matrices, the research team was able to prove, as best they could at this stage, why the calculation of the squared difference of the neutrino masses are closest with the experimental results in the case of the seesaw model with the random Dirac and Majorana matrices.\n\"In this study, we showed that the neutrino mass hierarchy can be mathematically explained using random matrix theory. However, this proof is not mathematically complete and is expected to be rigorously proven as random matrix theory continues to develop,\" said Professor Haba. \"In the future, we will continue with our challenge of elucidating the three-generation copy structure of elementary particles, the essential nature of which is still completely unknown both theoretically and experimentally.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNaoyuki Haba et al, Neutrino mass square ratio and neutrinoless double-beta decay in random neutrino mass matrices, Progress of Theoretical and Experimental Physics (2023).

   "text": "Researchers Ludovico Lami (QuSoft, University of Amsterdam) and Mark M. Wilde (Cornell) have made significant progress in quantum computing by deriving a formula that predicts the effects of environmental noise. This is crucial for designing and building quantum computers capable of working in our imperfect world.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantum computing uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations. Unlike classical computers, which use bits that can be either 0 or 1, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can be in a superposition of 0 and 1 simultaneously.\nThis allows quantum computers to perform certain types of calculations much faster than classical computers. For example, a quantum computer can factor very large numbers in a fraction of the time it would take a classical computer.\nWhile one could naively attribute such an advantage to the ability of a quantum computer to perform numerous calculations in parallel, the reality is more complicated. The quantum wave function of the quantum computer (which represents its physical state) possesses several branches, each with its own phase. A phase can be thought of as the position of the hand of a clock, which can point in any direction on the clockface.\nAt the end of its computation, the quantum computer recombines the results of all computations it simultaneously carried out on different branches of the wave function into a single answer. \"The phases associated to the different branches play a key role in determining the outcome of this recombination process, not unlike how the timing of a ballerina's steps play a key role in determining the success of a ballet performance,\" explains Lami.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Light can travel through an optical fiber via different paths. The impossibility of knowing the exact path a light ray has taken leads to an effective dephasing noise. Credit: L. Lami\n             \n\n\nDisruptive environmental noise \nA significant obstacle to quantum computing is environmental noise. Such noise can be likened to a little demon that alters the phase of different branches of the wave function in an unpredictable way. This process of tampering with the phase of a quantum system is called dephasing, and can be detrimental to the success of a quantum computation.\nDephasing can occur in everyday devices such as optical fibers, which are used to transfer information in the form of light. Light rays traveling through an optical fiber can take different paths; since each path is associated to a specific phase, not knowing the path taken amounts to an effective dephasing noise.\nIn their new publication in Nature Photonics, Lami and Wilde analyze a model, called the bosonic dephasing channel, to study how noise affects the transmission of quantum information. It represents the dephasing acting on a single mode of light at definite wavelength and polarization.\nThe number quantifying the effect of the noise on quantum information is the quantum capacity, which is the number of qubits that can be safely transmitted per use of a fiber. The new publication provides a full analytical solution to the problem of calculating the quantum capacity of the bosonic dephasing channel, for all possible forms of dephasing noise.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nLonger messages overcome errors\nTo overcome the effects of noise, one can incorporate redundancy in the message to ensure that the quantum information can still be retrieved at the receiving end. This is similar to saying \"Alpha, Beta, Charlie\" instead of \"A, B, C\" when speaking on the phone. Although the transmitted message is longer, the redundancy ensures that it is understood correctly.\nThe new study quantifies exactly how much redundancy needs to be added to a quantum message to protect it from dephasing noise. This is significant because it enables scientists to quantify the effects of noise on quantum computing and develop methods to overcome these effects.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLudovico Lami, Exact solution for the quantum and private capacities of bosonic dephasing channels, Nature Photonics (2023).

   "text": "Researchers at Berkeley Lab's Accelerator Technology & Applied Physics (ATAP) Division have developed a method for detecting and predicting the local loss of superconductivity in large-scale magnets that are capable of generating high magnetic fields. These high-field magnets are a core enabling technology for many areas of scientific research, medicine, and energy, where they are used in a range of applications, including in particle accelerators and colliders for high-energy and nuclear physics, diagnostic and therapeutic medical devices, and energy generation, transmission, and storage technologies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-field magnets also show promise as an enabling technology for magnetic confinement fusion reactors, which aim to replicate the processes that power the sun by fusing two hydrogen isotopes (deuterium and tritium) to produce a carbon-free source of energy. They are used to confine the plasma of deuterium and tritium so that fusion can occur.\nTo realize the full potential of these reactors \"will require high-performance superconducting magnets capable of generating large magnetic fields safely and reliably under the demanding dynamic conditions found in fusion reactors,\" says Reed Teyber, a Research Scientist at ATAP's Superconducting Magnet Program who is developing diagnostic tools for monitoring the performance of both low- and high-temperature superconducting magnets. The work is published in the journal Scientific Reports.\nSuperconducting cables, however, can experience sudden and unpredictable losses in superconductivity\u2014a phenomenon referred to as quenching\u2014that can generate temperatures high enough to destroy the magnets, costing millions of dollars in damage.\n\"While for older, low-temperature superconducting magnets quenching is inherent, it must be avoided altogether in high-temperature superconducting magnets to ensure their reliable and safe operation,\" explains Reed. \"Detecting a quench and preventing it from damaging magnets is, therefore, a central focus for researchers looking to develop superconducting magnets for compact fusion reactors.\"\nRare-earth barium copper oxide (ReBCO) is a promising material for the fabrication of superconducting magnets used in fusion reactors. ReBCO tape, which is used in the cables that carry the currents in superconducting magnets, has a high critical temperature (making it a so-called high-temperature superconductor), high critical field, and the potential to form demountable magnets\u2014an important property that improves maintenance access, simplifies materials component testing, and allows for modularity to accommodate future reactor designs.\nSuperconducting magnets are familiar in such applications as colliders for high-energy physics, so methods exist for quench protection in low-temperature superconducting magnets like niobium-titanium or niobium-tin. These methods use voltage or temperature measurements to trigger energy extraction processes. However, Reed says quench detection in high-temperature superconducting magnets, like those that use ReBCO, needed for fusion reactors is far more challenging and calls for new approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Reed Teyber working on high-temperature superconducting CORC cable. Credit: Berkeley Lab/Carl A. Williams\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese extremely powerful magnets, capable of generating magnetic fields exceeding 20 tesla, are characterized by a much slower initial rate of quench development compared to accelerator magnets, making it difficult to detect quenches using voltage- or temperature-based techniques.\nTo address this issue, Reed is working with colleagues at ATAP to develop a method that employs an array of Hall probes\u2014devices that are used to measure the magnetic fields created when a current-carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field\u2014to measure the magnetic fields produced around ReBCO CORC cables. These cables are composed of numerous \"conductor-on-round-core\" wires made from tapes of ReBCO to achieve the required current capacity.\nCurrent distributions for the individual conductors recreated from these measurements provide insights into the detailed dynamics of magnet operation, allowing the extraction of parameters for a predictive model.\nAlthough it shows promise as a powerful technique for quench detection and prevention, it currently has many limitations, notes Reed. \"For example, it only works for specific magnet technologies with no inter-cable current sharing and cables of moderate length.\"\nHowever, he adds, it turns out that demountable toroidal field coils wound from ReBCO cables meet these requirements. Toroidal field coils are the leading superconducting magnet technology for generating the enormous magnetic fields required for containing the plasma to ensure fusion reactions can happen.\n\"We are now looking into how we can use our technique to solve the problem of quench detection in these coils.\"\nReed says the work could be a \"game-changer\" not only for superconducting magnets used in nuclear fusion reactor experiments, but also for particle accelerators in high-energy physics, magnetic energy storage technologies, medicine, and various power devices such as electric motors, generators, and transmission lines.\n\"This innovative technique conceived by Reed,\" said Paolo Ferracin, deputy program head of ATAP's Superconducting Magnet Program, \"has the potential to serve as a key element in solving the quench protection for high-temperature superconductor cables, a fundamental issue for the scientific community working on the next generation of superconducting magnets.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReed Teyber et al, Current distribution monitoring enables quench and damage detection in superconducting fusion magnets, Scientific Reports (2022).

   "text": "Intense laser light can induce magnetism in solids on the attosecond scale\u2014the fastest magnetic response to date. That is the finding reached by theoreticians at the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter in Hamburg, Germany, who used advanced simulations to investigate the magnetization process in several 2D and 3D materials.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir calculations show that, in structures with heavy atoms, the fast electron dynamics initiated by the laser pulses can be converted to attosecond magnetism. The work has been published in npj Computational Materials.\nThe team concentrated on several benchmark 2D and 3D material systems, but the results apply to all materials that include heavy atomic constituents. \"The heavy atoms are especially important, because they induce a strong spin-orbit interaction,\" explains lead author Ofer Neufeld. \"This interaction is key to converting the light-induced electron motion into spin polarization\u2014in other words, into magnetism. Otherwise, light simply doesn't interact with the electrons' spin.\"\nJust like tiny compass needles, electrons can also be imagined as having an internal needle that points to some direction in space, e.g. 'up' or 'down'\u2014the so-called 'spin'. Each electron's spin direction depends on the chemical environment around it, for instance which atoms it can see and where other electrons are. In non-magnetic materials, the electrons spin equally in all directions. In contrast, when the individual electrons' spins align with each other to point in the same direction, the material becomes magnetic.\nThe theoreticians set out to investigate what magnetic phenomena can occur when solids interact with intense linearly-polarized laser pulses, that typically accelerate electrons on very fast timescales inside matter. \"These conditions are fascinating to explore, because when the laser pulses have a linear polarization, they are typically believed not to induce any magnetism,\" says Neufeld.\nUnexpectedly, their simulations showed that these particularly powerful lasers do magnetize materials, even though the magnetism is transient\u2014it lasts only until the laser pulse is turned off. The most remarkable finding, however, concerned the speed of this process: The magnetization evolves on extremely short timescales, less than 500 attoseconds\u2014a prediction for the fastest magnetic response ever. For scale, a single attosecond is to one second as one second is to about 32 billion years.\nUsing advanced simulation tools to explain the underlying mechanism, the team showed that the intense light flips the electrons' spins back and forth. The laser effectively accelerates the electrons in circular-like orbits in the space of a few hundred attoseconds. These strong spin-orbit interactions then align the spin directions.\nThe process can be imagined as a bowling ball sliding across a surface which then starts to roll: In this analogy the light pushes the ball around, and the spin-orbit interactions (a force arising from the nearby heavy nuclei as the electron orbits around it) cause it to roll back and forth, magnetizing it. Both forces act together to get the ball rolling.\nThe results offer fascinating new insights into the fundamentals of magnetization, says Neufeld: \"We found that it's a highly nonlinear effect which can be tuned by the laser's properties. The results hint, though don't unequivocally prove, that the ultimate speed limit for magnetism is several tens of attoseconds, because that's the natural speed limit of electronic motion.\"\nUnderstanding these light-induced magnetization processes at their fundamental level in a range of materials is a crucial step towards the development of ultrafast memory devices and changes the current understanding of magnetism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOfer Neufeld et al, Attosecond magnetization dynamics in non-magnetic materials driven by intense femtosecond lasers, npj Computational Materials (2023).

They show that it can achieve a depth resolution more than three orders of magnitude greater than state-of-the-art methods for multiplane holographic projection.\n\"Our new method overcomes two long-existing bottlenecks in current digital holographic techniques\u2014low axial resolution and high interplane crosstalk\u2014that prevent fine depth control of the hologram and thus limit the quality of the 3D display,\" said Gong. \"Our approach could also improve holography-based optical encryption by allowing more data to be encrypted in the hologram.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                The new 3D scattering-assisted dynamic holography approach creates a digital hologram by projecting high-resolution images onto planes spaced closely together (a), achieving a more realistic representation than conventional holography techniques (b). Credit: Lei Gong, University of Science and Technology of China\n             \n\n\nProducing more detailed holograms\nCreating a dynamic holographic projection typically involves using a spatial light modulator (SLM) to modulate the intensity and/or phase of a light beam. However, today's holograms are limited in terms of quality because current SLM technology allows only a few low-resolution images to be projected onto sperate planes with low depth resolution.\nTo overcome this problem, the researchers combined an SLM with a diffuser that enables multiple image planes to be separated by a much smaller amount without being constrained by the properties of the SLM. By also suppressing crosstalk between the planes and exploiting scattering of light and wavefront shaping, this setup enables ultrahigh-density 3D holographic projection.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nTo test the new method, the researchers first used simulations to show that it could produce 3D reconstructions with a much smaller depth interval between each plane. For example, they were able to project a 3D rocket model with 125 successive image planes at a depth interval of 0.96 mm in a single 1000\u00d71000-pixel hologram, compared to 32 image planes with a depth interval of 3.75 mm using another recently developed approach known as random vector-based computer-generated holography.\n\n\n\n\n\n                The researchers used their new method to simulate a holographic representation of a rocket [drawing shown in (a), point-cloud model in (b)]. A volume-rendered image of the 3D rocket projected by the random vector-based computer-generated holography (RV-CGH) method is shown in (c), using a single 1000\u00d71000-pixel hologram. The 3D projection is represented by 32 images with a depth interval of 3.75 mm. Volume-rendered image of the object projected by 3D-SDH is shown in (d). 125 image planes with a uniform distance of 0.96 mm are simultaneously projected from a single 1000\u00d71000-pixel hologram. Volume-rendered images of the simulated 3D rocket with varying perspective views are pictured in (e\u2013g). Credit: Lei Gong, University of Science and Technology of China\n             \n\n\nTo validate the concept experimentally, they built a prototype 3D-SDH projector to create dynamic 3D projections and compared this to a conventional state-of- the-art setup for 3D Fresnel computer-generated holography. They showed that 3D-SDH achieved an improvement in axial resolution of more than three orders of magnitude over the conventional counterpart.\nThe 3D holograms the researchers demonstrated are all point-cloud 3D images, meaning they cannot present the solid body of a 3D object. Ultimately, the researchers would like to be able to project a collection of 3D objects with a hologram, which would require a higher pixel-count hologram and new algorithms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPanpan Yu et al, Ultrahigh-density 3D Holographic Projection by Scattering-assisted Dynamic Holography, Optica (2023).

   "text": "An atomic nucleus assumes discrete energy levels when added energy excites that nucleus. These energy levels are the nucleus' unique fingerprint; no two nuclei have identical energy patterns. For exotic nuclei, which have unbalanced numbers of protons and neutrons and often only exist for a fraction of a second, researchers have devised a variety of methods to measure the energies of their excited levels.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers recently found unusual levels that formed when a beam of calcium-38 traveling at 30 percent of the speed of light collided with a beryllium-9 target. The calcium-38 nuclei lost a substantial amount of energy in the encounter.\nThe researchers traced the unusual excited levels formed in calcium-38 back to the simultaneous excitation of several protons and neutrons. The energies of such complex states are sensitive probes for nuclear theory. They are difficult to observe in reactions typically performed at high beam energies at particle accelerators.\nThus, such dissipative scattering reactions are a new tool in the arsenal of nuclear researchers who study and model nuclei. In the future, researchers can use these kinds of reactions to study unusual energy levels in many other short-lived nuclei to probe nuclear theory, for example, at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams.\nResearchers found a novel pathway leading to the formation of complex excited states in rare isotopes. They performed the experiment at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, a cyclotron-based particle accelerator at Michigan State University formerly operated as a National Science Foundation user facility. These excited states appear to involve the rearrangement of multiple nucleons, formed in a single, highly energetic projectile-target collision.\nThe energies of such states are sensitive benchmarks for shell-model calculations that straddle large model spaces. For the rare isotope calcium-38, the researchers observed the population of such energy levels via in-beam \u03b3-ray spectroscopy with GRETINA.\nThis followed after inelastic scattering in which the calcium-38 incoming beam interacted with a beryllium-9 target at more than 30 percent of the speed of light. The incoming calcium-38 beam surprisingly lost more than 200 million electronvolts in energy. These tell-tale complex-structure states previously have been out of reach in the typically high-luminosity fast-beam experiments without such high energy loss. They most often elude observation in low-energy reactions, which require far higher beam intensities.\nThis work was performed by a collaboration of experimentalists and theorists from Michigan State University, the University of Washington in St. Louis, Argonne National Laboratory, and the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom.

   "text": "Researchers have developed a way to create photonic time crystals, and they have shown that these bizarre, artificial materials amplify the light that shines on them. These findings, described in a paper in Science Advances, could lead to more efficient and robust wireless communications and significantly improved lasers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime crystals were first conceived by Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek in 2012. Mundane, familiar crystals have a structural pattern that repeats in space, but in a time crystal, the pattern repeats in time instead. While some physicists were initially skeptical that time crystals could exist, recent experiments have succeeding in creating them. Last year, researchers at Aalto University's Low Temperature Laboratory created paired time crystals that could be useful for quantum devices.\nNow, another team has made photonic time crystals, which are time-based versions of optical materials. The researchers created photonic time crystals that operate at microwave frequencies, and they showed that the crystals can amplify electromagnetic waves. This ability has potential applications in various technologies, including wireless communication, integrated circuits, and lasers.\nSo far, research on photonic time crystals has focused on bulk materials\u2014that is, three-dimensional structures. This has proven enormously challenging, and the experiments haven't gotten past model systems with no practical applications. So the team, which included researchers from Aalto University, the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), and Stanford University, tried a new approach: building a two-dimensional photonic time crystal, known as a metasurface.\n\"We found that reducing the dimensionality from a 3D to a 2D structure made the implementation significantly easier, which made it possible to realize photonic time crystals in reality,\" says Xuchen Wang, the study's lead author, who was a doctoral student at Aalto and is currently at KIT.\nThe new approach enabled the team to fabricate a photonic time crystal and experimentally verify the theoretical predictions about its behavior. \"We demonstrated for the first time that photonic time crystals can amplify incident light with high gain,\" says Wang.\n\"In a photonic time crystal, the photons are arranged in a pattern that repeats over time. This means that the photons in the crystal are synchronized and coherent, which can lead to constructive interference and amplification of the light,\" explains Wang. The periodic arrangement of the photons means they can also interact in ways that boost the amplification.\nTwo-dimensional photonic time crystals have a range of potential applications. By amplifying electromagnetic waves, they could make wireless transmitters and receivers more powerful or more efficient. Wang points out that coating surfaces with 2D photonic time crystals could also help with signal decay, which is a significant problem in wireless transmission. Photonic time crystals could also simplify laser designs by removing the need for bulk mirrors that are typically used in laser cavities.\nAnother application emerges from the finding that 2D photonic time crystals don't just amplify electromagnetic waves that hit them in free space but also waves traveling along the surface. Surface waves are used for communication between electronic components in integrated circuits. \"When a surface wave propagates, it suffers from material losses, and the signal strength is reduced. With 2D photonic time crystals integrated into the system, the surface wave can be amplified, and communication efficiency enhanced,\" says Wang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tXuchen Wang et al, Metasurface-Based Realization of Photonic Time Crystals, Science Advances (2023).

   "text": "In the era of big data, global data volume is growing exponentially. The development of numerous technologies depends on massive data and also generates massive data. Data mining, storage, and protection are becoming increasingly important. The development of traditional data storage technology can no longer keep up with the speed of data generation, and new high-density, long-lasting, and low-cost storage methods need to be developed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional data storage technology basically stores one-dimensional data on a two-dimensional surface. To break through the limitations of existing technologies, we need to think from storage dimension increasing.\nHolographic data storage seems to be a feasible solution. It uses interference between information light encoding patterns and reference light encoding patterns to record holograms in the medium. When reading, only the reference beam is used to diffract the information light pattern from the hologram.\nHolographic data storage technology has the characteristics of three-dimensional volume storage and two-dimensional data transmission, which enables higher storage density and faster data transmission speed, making it a powerful competitor for the next generation of storage technology.\nIn fact, holographic data storage technology has been proposed for 60 years, but it has not yet been practically applied. One of the reasons is that traditional holographic data storage uses only amplitude modulation, which does not correspond to the theoretical intention of holography, and the actual storage density achieved is far from the theoretical value.\nTo fully exploit the advantages of holographic data storage, complex amplitude modulation must be used for recording and reading. However, the technical bottleneck lies in phase reading, as the phase cannot be directly obtained by detectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Fig. 2 Physical model of near field diffraction for lensless detection. Credit: Compuscript Ltd\n             \n\n\nThe problem with using interference to read the phase is that the system is unstable and not conducive to practicality, while traditional non-interference methods often require iterative calculations, which reduce data transmission speed. In a new article in Opto-Electronic Advances, researchers propose to use the intensity image of near-field diffraction to simultaneously and non-iteratively read amplitude and phase information accurately without interference, solving the key technical bottleneck of holographic data storage complex amplitude modulation.\nThe core of this model lies in using an end-to-end convolutional neural network to extract high-frequency and low-frequency image features from near-field diffraction patterns, corresponding to modulation of phase and amplitude encoding. Based on the training of the neural network, a network with generalization ability is established to accurately predict new complex amplitude encoding information.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, deep learning accumulates enough redundant feature information in the time dimension to compensate for the dimensional loss problem caused by the inability to detect phase in space. There is a good point of integration between deep learning and holographic data storage. Unlike other imaging applications, because the encoding of holographic data storage is controllable, this encoding prior can be used to consciously modulate the encoding rules, producing more differentiated data samples and making deep learning more efficient.\nThe research group of Prof. Xiaodi Tan from Fujian Normal University proposed a deep learning-based near-field diffraction decoding system, which can accurately read both amplitude and phase information in a non-interferometric, non-iterative and fast way, thus solving the key technical bottleneck of complex amplitude modulation in holographic data storage.\nThe success of combining deep learning with holographic data storage depends on three key points. One of the key points is the lensless near-field diffraction intensity detection. The lensless system and the choice of near-field distance are both to ensure that the light field has certain diffraction effects, so that the phase changes can be transmitted to the intensity distribution through diffraction, while the amplitude features are still preserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Fig. 3 Change in the mean square error (MSE) using two different phase encoding datasets with (a) (0, \u03c0/2, \u03c0, 3\u03c0/2) and (b) (\u03c0/6, 2\u03c0/3, \u03c0, 3\u03c0/2) when training the same neural network. (1) and (3) are the same intensity images fed to the CNN and (2) and (4) are the ground truth of the phase data page. The pages at the 1st, 20th, 40th, and 60th epoch are the phase data page retrieved from the intensity image using the trained CNN. Credit: Compuscript Ltd\n             \n\n\nIn simulation and experiments, this correspondence exists within a certain range, and the specific diffraction distance depends on factors such as the spatial frequency and complexity of the input encoding. For example, if the encoding has a high spatial frequency, the diffraction effect is stronger, and the near-field diffraction distance should be shorter. The second key point is to find the feature differences between amplitude and phase. Since both amplitude and phase are learned from the near-field diffraction intensity map, there must be distinguishable points to prevent confusion between them.\nThe researchers found that the feature that determines the amplitude learning network is the intensity distribution of the low-frequency part, while the feature that determines the phase learning network is the phase difference pattern of the high-frequency part. This enables the same near-field diffraction intensity map to reconstruct amplitude and phase separately without interference.\nThe third key point is unequal interval encoding. Usually, uniform encoding has a larger encoding interval, which can reduce the encoding reconstruction interference, but in this method, the phase difference combination generated by the uniform interval encoding is completely the same, and deep learning cannot distinguish the corresponding diffraction features. Therefore, non-uniform encoding can greatly improve the diversity of samples, so that the deep learning network can accurately identify complex amplitude encoding.\nThis work not only has applications in the field of holographic data storage, but also has an impact on other fields of computational imaging based on deep learning. The unclear physical meaning of the \"black box\" of deep learning limits its application. In the field of holographic data storage, the encoding can be freely designed, providing research targets with prior knowledge. Therefore, by establishing an evaluation mechanism for deep learning complex amplitude encoding and decoding, analyzing the relationship between different encoding conditions and the efficiency of deep learning decoding, it is possible to determine which encoding rules are more suitable for deep learning decoding, formulate optimization strategies for complex amplitude encoding in holographic data storage, and iteratively optimize between encoding and decoding based on this strategy. This can give structured physical functions to the parameters of the deep neural network structure and lay a foundation for opening up the \"black box\" of deep learning.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJianying Hao et al, Lensless complex amplitude demodulation based on deep learning in holographic data storage, Opto-Electronic Advances (2023).

   "text": "Over the short span of just 300 years, since the invention of modern physics, we have gained a deeper understanding of how our universe works on both small and large scales.

But my colleagues and I are creating a new physics of life that might soon provide answers.\nMore than 150 years ago, Darwin poignantly noted the dichotomy between what we understand in physics and what we observe in life\u2014noting at the end of The Origin of Species \"\u2026whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been and are being evolved.\"\nThe importance of time\nIsaac Newton described a universe where the laws never change, and time is an immutable and absolute backdrop against which everything moves. Darwin, however, observed a universe where endless forms are generated, each changing features of what came before, suggesting that time should not only have a direction, but that it in some ways folds back on itself. New evolutionary forms can only arise via selection on the past.\nPresumably these two areas of science are describing the same universe, but how can two such diametrically opposite views be unified? The key to understanding why life is not explainable in current physics may be to reconsider our notions of time as the key difference between the universe as described by Newton and that of Darwin. Time has, in fact, been reinvented many times through the history of physics.\nAlthough Newton's time was fixed and absolute, Einstein's time became a dimension\u2014just like space. And just as all points in space exist all at once, so do all points in time. This philosophy of time is sometimes referred to as the \"block universe\" where the past, present and future are equally real and exist in a static structure\u2014with no special \"now\". In quantum mechanics, the passage of time emerges from how quantum states change from one to the next.\nThe invention of thermodynamics gave time its arrow, explaining why it's moving forward rather than backwards. That's because there are clear examples of systems in our universe, such as a working engine, that are irreversible\u2014only working in one direction. Each new area of fundamental physics, whether describing space and time (Newton/Einstein), matter and light (quantum mechanics), or heat and work (thermodynamics) has introduced a new concept of time.\nBut what about evolution and life? To build novel things, evolution requires time. Endless novelty can only come to be in a universe where time exists and has a clear direction. Evolution is the only physical process in our universe that can generate the succession of novel objects we associate to life\u2014things like microbes, mammals, trees and even cellphones.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nInformation and memory\nSuch objects cannot fluctuate into existence spontaneously. They require a memory, based on what existed in the past, to construct things in the present. It is such \"selection\" that determines the dividing line between the universe described by current physics, and what Darwin saw: it is the mechanism that turns a universe where memory does not matter in determining what exists, to one where it does.\nThink about it, everything in the living world requires some kind of memory and information flow. The DNA in our cells is our blueprint. And to invent new things, such as rockets or medication, living beings also need information\u2014knowledge of the laws of physics and chemistry.\nTo explain life, we therefore need to understand how the complex objects life creates exist in time. With my collaborators, we have been doing just that in a newly proposed theory of physics called assembly theory.\nA key conjecture of assembly theory is that, as objects become more complex, the number of unique parts that make it up increases, and so does the need for local memory to store how to assemble the object from its unique parts. We quantify this in assembly theory as the shortest number of physical steps to build an object from its elementary building blocks, called the assembly index.\nImportantly, assembly theory treats this shortest path as an intrinsic property of the object, and indeed we have shown how assembly index can be measured for molecules using several different measuring techniques including mass spectrometry (an analytical method to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of molecules).\nWith this approach, we have shown in the lab, with measurements on both biological and non-biological samples, how molecules with an assembly index above 15 steps are only found in living samples.\nThis suggests that assembly theory is indeed capable of testing our hypothesis that life is the only physics that generates complex objects. And we can do so by identifying those objects that are so complex the only physical mechanism to form them is evolution.\nWe are aiming to use our theory to estimate when the origin of life happens by measuring the point at which molecules in a chemical soup become so complex that they start using information to make copies of themselves\u2014the threshold at which life arises from non-life. We may then apply the theory to experiments aiming to generate a new origin of life event in the lab.\nAnd when we know this, we can use the theory to look for life on worlds that are radically different to Earth, and may therefore look so alien that we wouldn't recognize life there.\nIf the theory holds, it will force a radical rethink on time in physics. According to our theory, assembly can be measured as an intrinsic property for molecules, which corresponds to their size in time\u2014meaning time is a physical attribute.\nUltimately, time is intrinsic to our experiences of the world, and it is necessary for evolution to happen. If we want physics to be capable of explaining life\u2014and us\u2014it may be that we need to treat time as a material property for the first time in physics.\nThis is perhaps the most radical departure for physics of life from standard physics, but it may be the critical insight needed to explain what life is.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Conversation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

   "text": "A team of physicists from Ghent University\u2014Interuniversity Microelectronics Center, Technical University of Denmark and Politecnico & Universit\u00e0 di Bari, reports that it is possible to use quantum fluctuations to generate random numbers faster than standard methods.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn their study, reported in the journal PRX Quantum, the group used the behavior of pairs of particles and antiparticles to create a random generator that is up to 200 times faster than conventional systems.\nRandom number generation is important in computer science. In addition to such applications as generating random backdrops and scenarios in video games, random numbers are used to create encryption keys for a host of sensitive applications. But generating keys that cannot be easily cracked requires computer power and time. For that reason, computer scientists are constantly looking for new ways to generate random numbers.\nIn this new effort, the research team turned to a new source\u2014quantum fluctuation\u2014which, in its most basic form, is a temporary change in the amount of energy that exists at a unique point in space. Such flickering has been widely studied due to the way it impacts chemical bonding and resulting types of light scattering. In this new effort, the research team took advantage of the randomness of such flickering to create a random number generator. In their approach, they focused on quantum flickering related to instances of particles and antiparticles forming and self-destructing and the fields of energy associated with them. Such flickering has in the past been shown to be random.\nTo capture the randomness of such flickering, the researchers used an integrated balanced homodyne detector\u2014a device that is capable of measuring the electric field of a quantum state. But noting that such a device is susceptible to also capturing the less-than-random behavior of entangling particles, they added another device designed to identify this noise and ignore it while taking measurements.\nThe team then shrank the components used by their homodyne detector to a size that would allow incorporation on a chip installed in a computer system.

   "text": "Magnetic nanostructures have long been part of our everyday life, e.g., in the form of fast and compact data storage devices or highly sensitive sensors. A major contribution to the understanding of many of the relevant magnetic effects and functionalities is made by a special measurement method: X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis impressive term describes a fundamental effect of the interaction between light and matter: In a ferromagnetic material, there is an imbalance of electrons with a certain angular momentum, the spin. If one shines circularly polarized light, which also has a defined angular momentum, through a ferromagnet, a clear difference in transmission for a parallel or anti-parallel alignment of the two angular momenta is observable\u2014a so-called dichroism.\nThis circular dichroism of magnetic origin is particularly pronounced in the soft-X-ray region (200 to 2000 eV energy of the light particles, corresponding to a wavelength of only 6 to 0.6 nm), when considering the element-specific absorption edges of transition metals, such as iron, nickel, or cobalt, as well as rare earths, such as dysprosium or gadolinium.\n\n\n\n\n\n                The averaged transmission through the investigated sample at the Fe L absorption edges (black data points) can be measured precisely and is well described by a simulation (black line). At the two absorption maxima, see insets, significant dichroism for the two different directions of saturation magnetization of the sample is observable. So far, such experiments have only been possible at large-scale facilities. Credit: Forschungsverbund Berlin e.V. (FVB)\n             \n\n\nThese elements are particularly important for the technical application of magnetic effects. The XMCD effect allows for precisely determining the magnetic moment of the respective elements, even in buried layers in a material and without damaging the sample system. If the circularly polarized soft-X-ray radiation comes in very short femto- to picosecond (ps) pulses, even ultrafast magnetization processes can be monitored on the relevant time scale.\nUntil now, access to the required X-ray radiation has only been possible at scientific large-scale facilities, such as synchrotron-radiation sources or free-electron lasers (FELs), and has thus been strongly limited.\nA team of researchers around junior research group leader Daniel Schick at the Max Born Institute (MBI) in Berlin has now succeeded for the first time in realizing XMCD experiments at the absorption L edges of iron at a photon energy of around 700 eV in a laser laboratory. A laser-driven plasma source was used to generate the required soft X-ray light, by focusing very short (2 ps) and intense (200 mJ per pulse) optical laser pulses onto a cylinder of tungsten.\nThe generated plasma thereby emits a lot of light continuously in the relevant spectral range of 200-2000 eV at a pulse duration of smaller than 10 ps. However, due to the stochastic generation process in the plasma, a very important requirement to observe XMCD is not met\u2014the polarization of the soft-X-ray light is not circular, as required, but completely random, similar to that of a light bulb.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Magnetic asymmetry behind the polarizer and the examined sample at the Fe L absorption edges. The two colors correspond to measurements with reversed magnetization of the polarizer - the magnetization direction of the sample is immediately evident from the sign of the dichroism observed (blue vs. red curve). The measurements can be reproduced very accurately by simulations (lines). Credit: Forschungsverbund Berlin e.V. (FVB)\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, the researchers used a trick: the X-ray light first passes through a magnetic polarization filter in which the same XMCD effect as described above is active. Due to the polarization-dependent dichroic transmission, an imbalance of light particles with parallel vs. anti-parallel angular momentum relative to the magnetization of the filter can be generated. After passing through the polarization filter, the partially circularly or elliptically polarized soft-X-ray light can be employed for the actual XMCD experiment on a magnetic sample.\nThe work, published in the journal Optica, demonstrates that laser-based X-ray sources are catching up with large-scale facilities.\n\"Our concept for generating circularly polarized soft X-rays is not only very flexible but also partly superior to conventional methods in XMCD spectroscopy due to the broadband nature of our light source,\" says the first author of the study and Ph.D. student at the MBI, Martin Borchert. In particular, the already demonstrated pulse duration of the generated X-ray pulses of only a few picoseconds opens up new possibilities to observe and ultimately understand even very fast magnetization processes, e.g., when triggered by ultrashort light flashes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMartin Borchert et al, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy at the Fe L edges with a picosecond laser-driven plasma source, Optica (2023).

   "text": "A team of nuclear physicists affiliated with multiple institutions in Japan, working with a colleague from Korea, has discovered a previously unknown uranium isotope with atomic number 92 and mass 241. In their study, reported in the journal Physical Review Letters, the group forced the isotope to reveal itself and tested the results of their efforts to show that what they had found was indeed uranium-241.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past several decades, physicists have found that determining the properties of neutron-rich isotopes is difficult due to problems caused in creating them. For that reason, ongoing research has been looking for new ways to synthesize them under lab conditions. In this new effort, the research team tried a new approach\u2014they fired a sample of unranium-238 nuclei at a sample of platinum-198 nuclei using an isotope separation system. Such interactions are known to result in multinucleon transfer, in which isotopes swap neutrons and protons. The collision resulted in the creation of a large number of fragments, which the researchers studied to determine their makeup.\nThey found evidence of 19 heavy isotopes holding from 143 to 150 neutrons. Each was measured using time-of-flight mass spectrometry, a technique that involves determining the mass of a traveling ion by tracking the time it takes to travel a given distance when its initial acceleration is known. The research team noted that most of the isotopes they measured had never been measured before. They also noted that one of them, uranium-241, had never been observed before and that it marks the first time since 1979 that a neutron-rich uranium isotope has been discovered. The researchers also calculated that uranium-241 likely has a half-life of just 40 minutes.\nThe technique used by the team represents a pathway to better understanding the shapes of large nuclei associated with the heavy elements, which could yield changes to models used to build nuclear power plants and weapons and to theories describing the behavior of exploding stars. The research team notes that that their method of discovery could be used to learn more about other heavy isotopes and also, perhaps, to discover new ones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tT.

In short, the DMI breaks the symmetry of the material, allowing the spins to mix.\nThe team utilized a copper based magnetic hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite, which has a unique octahedral structure. These octahedrons can tilt and deform in different ways. Adding an organic cation to the material breaks the symmetry, creating angles within the material that allow the different magnon modes to couple and the spins to mix.\n\"Beyond the quantum implications, this is the first time we've observed broken symmetry in a hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite,\" says Andrew Comstock, NC State graduate research assistant and first author of the research.\n\"We found that the DMI allows magnon coupling in copper-based hybrid perovskite materials with the correct symmetry requirements,\" Comstock says. \"Adding different cations creates different effects.

   "text": "Laser-induced electrochemical deposition of metals on metals relies possibly on thermal and defect generation effects. When semiconductor substrates are chosen, locally photogenerated electrons can reduce metal ions resulting in metallic surface structures. Laser-induced electrochemical de- and repassivation investigations can support in-situ corrosion research studies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thermoemission of nonequilibrium electrons was identified as a unique technique for the generation of picosecond current pulses which cannot be realized by conventional instrumentation. This allows short-lived intermediates of electrode reactions to be studied. Barring kinetic hindrance demanding the application of a certain overpotential, electrochemical reactions occur once the energy levels of the redox active species present in the electrolyte are crossed by the Fermi level of the electrode. Femtosecond laser pulse induced hot electron electrochemistry in aqueous solution allows a new perspective in the investigation of the electrode/electrolyte interface, the reactional pathways taken by short-lived intermediate species and laser processing in solution as a whole.\nThe term femtochemistry dates back to the pioneering work of Zewail, who employed femtosecond laser pulses in the investigation of molecular dynamics. Since molecular motion as well as chemical bond breaking and forming occurs on a femtosecond timescale, pump-probe experiments with femtosecond laser pulses allowed the first real time observation of the transition states of model chemical reactions. In 1999 Zewail was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on the disintegrations of iodocyanide ICN and sodium iodide NaI. Surface femtochemistry, concerning the time resolved observation of reactions of adsorbates at various interfaces, oftentimes relies upon hot electron induced processes. Those hot carriers are emitted from metals and semiconductors under experimental conditions.\nIn the past, hot carrier injection (HCI) was mainly regarded as an undesirable effect in device engineering. In fact, HCI is a main reason for transistor aging, with hot electrons or holes (depending on the doping of the transistor) tunneling into the gate dielectric. This leads to the build-up of charge within the dielectric layer, increasing the switching threshold voltage. As a result, the switching time of the device increases. Recently, however, the possibility to capitalize on this non-equilibrium effect has drawn active interest from the scientific community.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe desorption and reaction behavior of co-adsorbed O and CO on a Ru(0001) surface are a prime example for the profound insight hot electron driven femtochemistry can give into molecular dynamics at surfaces. Whereas the heating of the surface leads exclusively to CO desorption, the treatment with 100 fs near-infrared laser pulses (800 nm) opens a new reaction pathway. The non-equilibrium emission of hot electrons excited by the ultrashort laser pulses leads to the oxidation of CO to CO2. Double pulse experiments revealed the electron-mediation of the oxidation as opposed to the phonon-mediation of the CO desorption. The Ru-O bond activation was identified as the rate determining step.\nThe advent of hot carrier mediated energy transfer has also reached photovoltaics and photocatalysis. The novel working principle is the plasmonically driven direct conversion of (solar) light into electric energy in metal nanostructures. A common hot electron harvesting method is the transfer through a Schottky junction into the conduction band of a contacting semiconductor. An exemplary application of hot carriers in the optimization of the conversion efficiency of photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices is, e.g., the pairing of conventional semiconductor absorbers with metallic nanoparticles, resulting in a new energy-harvesting pathway. Light with a wavelength too long to be absorbed by the semiconductor can excite plasmon-enhanced hot electron emission in the neighboring metal. The emitted hot electrons are in turn able to pass into the conduction band of the semiconductor.\nMoreover, the dissociation of H2 at room temperature induced by the hot electron transfer from gold nanoparticles to adsorbed gas molecules is an intriguing process. Visible light at plasmon resonances brings the gold electron system out of equilibrium. Under the chosen experimental conditions, the excited plasmons decay nonradiatively, raising electrons to transient energy levels below vacuum. Due to their higher energy, the hot electrons are able to trespass the electronic equilibrium distribution and transfer into an anti-bonding state of a close hydrogen molecule.\nA practical implementation is autonomous water-splitting. It is based on an array of gold nanorods capped with a TiO2 layer to form a Schottky junction. The TiO2 layer is coated with platinum nanoparticles. The excitation process of the hot electrons is again plasmonically driven to increase efficiency. Excited hot electrons reach the gold nanorod surface and pass into the conduction band of the semiconductor layer. From there, they are captured by the nearby platinum nanoparticles, which in turn catalyze the hydrogen ion reduction. The residual defect electrons in the gold nanorod are replenished by a cobalt-based oxygen evolution catalyst also situated on the rod. Also hot electrons may be used to charge platinum nanoparticles, initiating chemical reactions. A similar approach with a broader perspective on electrochemical analysis was the voltage induced injection of hot electrons into the silver top layer of a metal-insulator-metal element, which allows the investigation of electrochemical processes occurring at significantly different potentials as in the equilibrium case.\nIn the group of Prof. Kautek, sub-picosecond laser pulses were employed to study the hot electron emission from metal electrodes into electrolyte solution. This elegant approach got rid of a pre-fabricated junction as an electron filter and relied purely on the properties of the electrochemical double layer. This way, the hot electrons were directly injected into the electrolyte solution, allowing the study of the metal/electrolyte interface and short-lived intermediates formed close to the electrode. The work is published in the journal Opto-Electronic Advances.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOskar Armbruster et al, Hot electron electrochemistry at silver activated by femtosecond laser pulses, Opto-Electronic Advances (2023).

   "text": "As fundamental properties of light, spectra and polarization carry vital information concerning the propagation of light waves. For example, spectral imaging can reflect the material composition of objects, while polarized imaging contains information on the texture of the surface, light polarization, and/or spatial distribution of the optical properties of a scene.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the crucial information provided by light wavelength and polarization, multispectral and polarized imaging technologies are of significant interest in various science and technology fields, including archeology, biology, remote sensing, and astronomy. Conventional multispectral and polarization imaging devices are based on filters and polarization analyzers, which usually require to take multiple shots to collect desired optical information and consist of bulky multi-pass systems or mechanically moving parts and are difficult to integrate into compact and integrated optical systems.\nMetasurfaces that achieve full control of light properties, such as phases, amplitudes, and polarization states, have been demonstrated. As two-dimensional optical devices consisting of sub-wavelength nanostructures, metasurfaces are suitable for the design of integrated systems. Today, metasurfaces have been used in many different types of functional optical devices, such as optical displays, orbital angular momentum devices, beam splitters, meta-holography elements, and light-field imaging.\nTo realize integrated and compact designs, metasurface elements have been used in polarization and multispectral optical systems. However, there remains a lack of metalens devices that can achieve both spectra- and polarization-resolved functionalities simultaneously while keeping a good imaging performance with a large numerical aperture (NA). On the technical side, although at least three projections are required to determine the polarization state, the longitude of the Poincare sphere (also expressed as polarization ellipticity) can also reflect abundant information of the scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Fig. 2. Multispectral and polarized imaging using the SPMM with laser source. Credit: Compuscript Ltd\n             \n\n\nThe research groups of Prof. Wei Xiong, Prof. Jinsong Xia, and Prof. Hui Gao from Huazhong University of Science and Technology proposed a spectra- and polarization ellipticity resolved multi-foci metalens (SPMM) methodology to realize the spectra- and polarization ellipticity resolved imaging without the requirement of any moving parts or bulky spectral and polarization optics. Their research is published in the journal Opto-Electronic Science.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike previously demonstrated common multispectral or polarization imaging systems, the SPMM can collect the desired optical information by only a single shot due to its twelve spectra- and polarization-dependent images at different locations, which simplifies the process of collecting optical information. In this SPMM design, the positions and intensities of foci/images on the focal/imaging plane can be changed by tuning the polarization ellipticity and/or spectra of incident light beams.\nTherefore, the as-developed SPMM device possesses both detection and reconstruction abilities of specific polarization ellipticity and discrete wavelengths (or spectral bands) while keeping normal functions of metalens such as focusing and imaging. And the SPMM has a sharing aperture design which possesses superior imaging performance due to the larger NA than that of the as-reported micro-metalens array design with the same fabrication size and focal length. Experimental demonstrations of the SPMM are performed with both coherent and incoherent light to prove its general applicability.\nThe light from imaged objects contains rich information associated with multiple wavelengths and polarization ellipticity, which is usually lost or ignored in traditional intensity-based imaging methods. To address this issue, the SPMM generates twelve foci or images at different positions, which correspond to six bands of spectra and two orthogonal circular polarization states. Furthermore, the spectra and polarization ellipticity (linear, elliptical, or circular) relating to specific object areas can be resolved and reconstructed by identifying the focusing/imaging positions and corresponding relative intensities.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Fig. 3. Multispectral and polarized imaging using the SPMM with ordinary white light beams. Credit: Compuscript Ltd\n             \n\n\nThe design and physical mechanism of the SPMM are based on the principles of geometric phase and holography. To realize a transversely dispersive metalens, the phase distributions of multiple lenses that possess different working wavelengths with corresponding foci at different positions can be encoded to a single metasurface element by the holography principle. The polarization-dependent metalens design can be obtained by adding these two Hadamard product results together. The focal position of this metalens can be switched by changing the polarization of the incident light beam. Therefore, an SPMM with twelve foci can be obtained by combining two transversely dispersive metalenses randomly as a single metasurface element, as shown in Fig. 1.\nCompared with the existing special metasurface spectra- or polarization detection elements based on a micro-metalens array, through the demonstration of the SPMM imaging with both ordinary coherent (Fig.2) and incoherent light sources (Fig.3), this work has exhibited its practical potential for the construction of ultra-compact multispectral and polarized imaging devices without the need of a multi-pass design using complicated spectral filters or mechanically moving parts. Moreover, this SPMM concept can be extended to the reconstruction of arbitrary points with both longitude and latitude on the Poincare sphere and achieve much finer partition of spectral bands via improved metalens design and nanofabrication techniques.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHui Gao et al, Multi-foci metalens for spectra and polarization ellipticity recognition and reconstruction, Opto-Electronic Science (2023).

   "text": "When many quantum particles interact, complex systems can be formed.

It is never possible to cool any object exactly to this temperature\u2014one can only approach absolute zero. This is the third law of thermodynamics.\nIn a study published in PRX Quantum, a research team at TU Wien (Vienna) has now investigated the question: How can this law be reconciled with the rules of quantum physics? They succeeded in developing a \"quantum version\" of the third law of thermodynamics: Theoretically, absolute zero is attainable. But for any conceivable recipe for it, you need three ingredients: Energy, time and complexity. And only if you have an infinite amount of one of these ingredients can you reach absolute zero.\nInformation and thermodynamics: An apparent contradiction\nWhen quantum particles reach absolute zero, their state is precisely known: They are guaranteed to be in the state with the lowest energy. The particles then no longer contain any information about what state they were in before. Everything that may have happened to the particle before is perfectly erased. From a quantum physics point of view, cooling and deleting information are thus closely related.\nAt this point, two important physical theories meet: Information theory and thermodynamics. But the two seem to contradict each other. \"From information theory, we know the so-called Landauer principle. It says that a very specific minimum amount of energy is required to delete one bit of information,\" explains Prof. Marcus Huber from the Atomic Institute of TU Wien. Thermodynamics, however, says that you need an infinite amount of energy to cool anything down exactly to absolute zero. But if deleting information and cooling to absolute zero are the same thing\u2014how does that fit together?\nEnergy, time and complexity\nThe roots of the problem lie in the fact that thermodynamics was formulated in the 19th century for classical objects\u2014for steam engines, refrigerators or glowing pieces of coal. At that time, people had no idea about quantum theory. If we want to understand the thermodynamics of individual particles, we first have to analyze how thermodynamics and quantum physics interact\u2014and that is exactly what Marcus Huber and his team did.\n\"We quickly realized that you don't necessarily have to use infinite energy to reach absolute zero,\" says Marcus Huber. \"It is also possible with finite energy\u2014but then you need an infinitely long time to do it.\" Up to this point, the considerations are still compatible with classical thermodynamics as we know it from textbooks. But then the team came across an additional detail of crucial importance:\n\"We found that quantum systems can be defined that allow the absolute ground state to be reached even at finite energy and in finite time\u2014none of us had expected that,\" says Marcus Huber. \"But these special quantum systems have another important property: they are infinitely complex.\" So you would need infinitely precise control over infinitely many details of the quantum system\u2014then you could cool a quantum object to absolute zero in finite time with finite energy. In practice, of course, this is just as unattainable as infinitely high energy or infinitely long time.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nErasing data in the quantum computer\n\"So if you want to perfectly erase quantum information in a quantum computer, and in the process transfer a qubit to a perfectly pure ground state, then theoretically you would need an infinitely complex quantum computer that can perfectly control an infinite number of particles,\" says Marcus Huber. In practice, however, perfection is not necessary\u2014no machine is ever perfect. It is enough for a quantum computer to do its job fairly well. So the new results are not an obstacle in principle to the development of quantum computers.\nIn practical applications of quantum technologies, temperature plays a key role today\u2014the higher the temperature, the easier it is for quantum states to break and become unusable for any technical use. \"This is precisely why it is so important to better understand the connection between quantum theory and thermodynamics,\" says Marcus Huber. \"There is a lot of interesting progress in this area at the moment. It is slowly becoming possible to see how these two important parts of physics intertwine.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhilip Taranto et al, Landauer Versus Nernst: What is the True Cost of Cooling a Quantum System?, PRX Quantum (2023).

He also developed a method that uses heat to adaptively correct imperfections that might occur after the mirror is unfolded.\n\"Although this work only demonstrated the feasibility of the methods, it lays the groundwork for larger packable mirror systems that are less expensive,\" said Rabien. \"It could make lightweight mirrors that are 15 or 20 meters in diameter a reality, enabling space-based telescopes that are orders of magnitude more sensitive than ones currently deployed or being planned.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                The researchers created the mirrors by using chemical vapor deposition to grow membrane mirrors on a rotating liquid inside a vacuum chamber. This allowed them to form parabolic thin membrane that can be used as the primary mirror of a telescope once coated with a reflecting surface such as aluminum. Credit: Sebastian Rabien, Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics\n             \n\n\nApplying an old process in a new way\nThe new method was developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, which Rabien says gave him some extra time to think and try out new concepts. \"In a long series of tests, we researched many liquids to find out their usability for the process, investigated how the polymer growth can be carried out homogeneously, and worked to optimize the process,\" he said.\nFor chemical vapor deposition, a precursor material is evaporated and thermally split into monomeric molecules. Those molecules deposit on the surfaces in a vacuum chamber and then combine to form a polymer. This process is commonly used to apply coatings such as the ones that make electronics water-resistant, but this is the first time it has been used to create parabolic membrane mirrors with the optical qualities necessary for use in telescopes.\nTo create the precise shape necessary for a telescope mirror, the researchers added a rotating container filled with a small amount of liquid to the inside of the vacuum chamber. The liquid forms a perfect parabolic shape onto which the polymer can grow, forming the mirror base. When the polymer is thick enough, a reflective metal layer is applied to the top via evaporation and the liquid is washed away.\n\"It has long been known that rotating liquids that are aligned with the local gravitational axis will naturally form a paraboloid surface shape,\" said Rabien. \"Utilizing this basic physics phenomenon, we deposited a polymer onto this perfect optical surface, which formed a parabolic thin membrane that can be used as the primary mirror of a telescope once coated with a reflecting surface such as aluminum.\"\nAlthough other groups have created thin membranes for similar purposes, these mirrors are typically shaped using a high-quality optical mold. Using a liquid to form the shape is much more affordable and can be more easily scaled up to large sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Membrane mirrors made using the new technique are flexible enough to be rolled up. This could be helpful for storing the mirrors inside of a launch vehicle. Credit: Sebastian Rabien, Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReshaping a folded mirror\nThe thin and lightweight mirror created using this technique can easily be folded or rolled up during the trip to space. However, it would be nearly impossible to get it back to the perfect parabolic shape after unpacking. To reshape the membrane mirror, the researchers developed a thermal method that uses a localized temperature change created with light to enable adaptive shape control that can bring the thin membrane into the desired optical shape.\nThe researchers tested their approach by creating 30-cm diameter membrane mirrors in a vacuum deposition chamber. After much trial and error, they were able to produce high quality mirrors with a surface shape suitable for telescopes. They also showed that their thermal radiative adaptive shaping method worked well, as demonstrated with an array of radiators and illumination from a digital light projector.\nThe new membrane-based mirrors could also be used in adaptive optics systems. Adaptive optics can improve the performance of optical systems by using a deformable mirror to compensate for distortion in incoming light. Because the surface of the new membrane mirrors is deformable, these mirrors could be shaped with electrostatic actuators to create deformable mirrors that are less expensive to make than those created with conventional methods.\nNext, the researchers plan to apply more sophisticated adaptive control to study how well the final surface can be shaped and how much of an initial distortion can be tolerated. They also plan to create a meter-sized deposition chamber to better study the surface structure and packaging and unfolding processes for a large-scale primary mirror.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSebastian Rabien, Adaptive Parabolic Membrane Mirrors for Large Deployable Space Telescopes, Applied Optics (2023).

   "text": "Integrated photonics is making strides towards hosting an increasing range of functionalities on a chip. Examples include information processing and computation as well as optical sensing and ranging applications. This has spurred advances in integrated laser light sources, which are needed for photonic chips to become truly autonomous devices. Thus, on-chip isolation likewise becomes important for suppressing feedback detrimental to their operation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonreciprocal optical devices can be realized using three methods: magnetic biasing, optical nonlinearity, and spatiotemporal modulation. Magnetic biasing is inherently broadband but requires lossy magneto-optical materials. Nonlinear non-reciprocal devices are achievable monolithically in certain materials, yet their operation is complicated by dependence on input power. Conversely, isolators that leverage spatiotemporal modulation have no such power scaling issues, and can readily be integrated monolithically, particularly on platforms with excellent electro-optical characteristics, such as lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI).\nIn this contribution, nonreciprocal operation is achieved by using spatiotemporal modulation of two cascaded traveling wave phase shifters. The microwave signal applied to the modulators and delay line ensures that their effect on forward-propagating light cancels out so that its spectral signature remains unchanged. However, reverse-propagating optical power is spectrally dispersed to the sidebands, which are then suppressed by a ring resonator filter, enabling an optical isolation of 27 dB.\nLithium niobate, due to its broad spectral transparency, high power handling capabilities, and strong nonlinear as well as electro-optic properties, for decades remained a staple material in nonlinear optics and optical fiber communications. The relatively recent emergence of thin-film lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI), as a direct analogue of silicon on insulator photonics, has enabled the creation of lithium niobate waveguides with tight mode confinements, that likewise allow for wafer-scale densely integrated photonics.\nRecent standout achievements on LNOI include efficient electro-optical frequency combs as well as modulators operating at CMOS voltage levels, however, long term prospects for LNOI photonics are extensive, and include fully integrated LiDAR, optical neural networks, or RF signal processing devices to name a few. Key prerequisites for such developments are emerging techniques of heterogeneous integration of on-chip coherent light sources, which must be isolated from feedback from the rest of the circuit to ensure their stable operation.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nTo address this issue, the research group of distinguished professor Arnan Mitchell from RMIT university realize integrated isolators in the LNOI waveguide platform. The findings are published in the journal Opto-Electronic Science.\nTheir device, depicted in the micrograph of Figure 1 (a), was fabricated using a loaded LNOI waveguide approach, in which refractive index contrast for light confinement is achieved not by etching out lithium niobate, but by processing a silicon nitride layer that is deposited on top of the LNOI wafer. The isolator design is based on a tandem modulator approach in which two identical traveling wave phase modulator sections are connected in series and separated by a looping delay line. The modulators are driven at the same harmonic signal frequency but with a shift in phase, so that for forward propagating light the two modulators counteract each other, and the 1550 nm wavelength carrier light exits the device unchanged.\nFor reverse propagation, this balance set by the delay line and modulating signal phase offset is not valid, hence the action of both modulators in cumulative and spectrally disperses the carrier energy into multiple sidebands. Device input is filtered through a racetrack resonator that is matched to the carrier frequency but designed to reject any modulation-induced spectral sidebands.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Figure\u00a02.\u00a0(a) The blue curve shows the measured transmission spectrum of the racetrack resonator. The red curve shows the measured spectrum of the cascaded phase modulators for light traveling in the reverse direction; Measured spectra of the isolator when operating the device in the (b) reverse direction and (c) forward direction, when using the racetrack resonator to suppress sidebands. Credit: Opto-Electronic Science (2023). DOI: 10.29026/oes.2023.220022\n             \n\n\nTesting the device by injecting the optical carrier in backward and forward directions revealed the non-reciprocal operation of the device. The blue curve in Figure 2 (a) shows the transmission spectrum of the racetrack resonator, which allows optical carriers with the same resonant frequency to pass through. Red curve shows the case when backward light was modulated but without being filtered by racetrack resonator. The original frequency of backward carriers was suppressed, and its power was transferred to sidebands.\nFigure 2 (b) shows the backward light was modulated and filtered by racetrack resonator, which means the light was strongly spectrally dispersed and is redirected without being able to pass the ring filter. Figure 2 (c) shows in forward propagation, most of the optical power remains confined in the carrier and only minimal power is transferred to the sidebands. Isolation strength was quantified by measuring the power transmission ratio between forward and reverse operation, resulting in an isolation of 27 dB.\nThis result is among the highest spatiotemporal modulation-based isolation ratios achieved on any platform to date. The demonstrated suppression of the reverse propagating light makes such isolators suitable for the integration with III-V laser diodes and Erbium doped gain sections in the thin-film lithium niobate on insulator waveguide platform.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHaijin Huang et al, Spatio-temporal isolator in lithium niobate on insulator, Opto-Electronic Science (2023).

Anisotropic nanopores with a larger concentration are observed with elliptically polarized pulses.

Hard X-rays are used to penetrate dense materials like bone or rock, while soft X-rays are required for safely imaging living matter such as tissue and cells.\nTypical single-energy detection takes place in the hard X-ray region of between 10 and 100s of kiloelectron volts (KeV). Detection in the soft window, meanwhile, may require energy levels below 1 KeV.\nSometimes, an X-ray detector must be able to operate across both energy levels. For example, when searching for tumors within breast tissue.\nExisting multi-energy X-ray detectors are made using silicon and selenium, and although they can operate in both regions, they are limited in their energy sensitivity and spatial resolution.\nA promising and potentially far more effective and versatile alternative has emerged in the form of metal halide perovskites.\nNamed for their crystal structure, perovskite materials are inexpensive to create and can effectively manage the intensity of an X-ray beam as it passes through matter, a process known as X-ray attenuation.\nImportantly, when the perovskite is fabricated within a diode device, the X-ray attenuation process induces the formation of charges that can be effectively collected to provide a signature of the X-ray energy and its intensity.\nIn this new work, it has been shown that perovskite-based multi-energy X-ray detectors can operate in a broad energy range from 0.1 KeV into the 10s of KeV, significantly wider than existing conventional multi-energy X-ray detectors.\nPrevious demonstrations of perovskite-based devices were limited to hard X-ray detection, and at a small scale ranging from millimeters to centimeters.\nNot only is this the first time that perovskites have been used for soft X-ray detection, the new approach is also suitable for scaling up to the large areas necessary for commercial use.\nAnd because the perovskite detectors will be made as a thin film, they could be combined with flexible substrates to unlock a new range of device shapes and sizes.\nProfessor Jacek Jasieniak of Monash University, an Exciton Science Chief Investigator and the senior author on the paper, said, \"This work showcases that there's a natural extension of perovskites into printed X-ray detectors.\n\"They should be cheaper to make, and could also involve modified film form factors, where you need inherent flexibility.\n\"It opens up the field to a whole new set of questions about how to use these types of devices.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBabar Shabbir et al, Printable Perovskite Diodes for Broad\u2010Spectrum Multienergy X\u2010Ray Detection, Advanced Materials (2023).

Researchers would immobilize their specimen, etch the top layer finely with a particle beam, image the revealed features with a scanning electron microscope or similar high-resolution methods, and repeat this process until the entire specimen volume has been consumed. However, in many instances, it is preferable to operate non-destructively, and then a form of tomography is necessary.\nIn a new paper published in eLight, a team of scientists led by Professor Ziling Wu from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, developed a new reconstruction method for 3D imaging.\nThe research team used integrated circuits (IC) as an exemplar because they presented some practical conveniences. ICs are rigid and, thus, require no fixing. They are also very useful in manufacturing process verification, failure analysis and counterfeits detection. On the other hand, the challenge of 3D IC imaging grows with time due to Moore's law.\nFor nondestructive 3D IC imaging at the nanoscale, hard X-rays are ideal probes because of their long penetration depth and short wavelength. Unlike medical X-ray tomography, however, which operates almost always on the intensity of the projections, in the nanoscale case it is common to seek the complex field via ptychography first, and then do tomography. This combined scheme is also known as X-ray ptychographic tomography (ptycho-tomography).\nThere are several reasons to do this. For example, if the projection approximation is still applicable, then scientists can perform two tomographic reconstructions in parallel. Most materials exhibit phase variations by 10 times larger than their respective absorption changes.\nX-ray ptycho-tomography reconstructions are performed in the same sequence as experimental acquisition, in a two-step approach. First, 2D projections are retrieved from far-field diffraction patterns using phase-retrieval algorithms, and then, tomographic reconstructions are implemented to recover the real and/or imaginary parts of a 3D object from 2D projections.\nMany applications have been successfully demonstrated with this two-step approach. These applications include IC imaging, microscopic organism imaging and studies of material properties such as fracture, percolation and hydration. However, both ptychography and tomography demand large redundancy in the data, leading to long acquisition and processing times generally.\nOne way to reduce the acquisition time is through high-precision scanners that can reliably work with efficient scanning schemes and at high scanning velocities. Reducing the data redundancy requirements in ptycho-tomography is an alternate way to speed up data acquisition but introduces ill-posedness. However, with reduced data, the conventional reconstruction algorithms are likely to produce artifacts and a general loss of fidelity.\nSupervised learning approaches often is a cause for concern regarding the generalization ability to new and unseen data. The researchers proposed a strategy to train on a subset of the sample, where a trustable but otherwise very slow alternative method can be used to obtain ground truths; and then use the train network on the rest of the sample, significantly speeding up the entire operation. This approach is appealing for integrated circuits or other large 3D specimens.\nIt is possible that transfer learning might alleviate the efforts for training RAPID anew for new experiments. For even more general specimens, like viruses and nanoparticles, comparable performance may be expected, but most likely at the cost of some redesign in the learning architecture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tZiling Wu et al, Three-dimensional nanoscale reduced-angle ptycho-tomographic imaging with deep learning (RAPID), eLight (2023).

However, there is a trade-off between accuracy and computation time; high-accuracy analysis of the phenomena requires a long computation time, and simplifying the process to shorten the computation time reduces prediction accuracy. In recent years, extensive research has been conducted on constructing models that predict physical phenomena using a fundamental AI technology known as machine learning. However, this approach was often not applicable to simulations under complex conditions as handled in conventional physical simulations, and there were issues in terms of reliability and versatility.\nBy combining physical simulations and machine learning, this research group realized a high-speed prediction model that guarantees reliability and versatility, while leveraging the strengths of machine learning to make predictions based on existing data. The group achieved high-speed predictions without significantly compromising the accuracy compared to conventional physical simulations by having the model learn from highly accurate simulation data prepared in advance. In addition, this newly-developed technology theoretically proves that prediction accuracy does not deteriorate, whereas prediction accuracy dropped with existing machine learning technology when observing the same phenomenon from a different perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Comparison of computation time and errors from the ground truth. The fast and accurate prediction is represented by the bottom left part of the figure.

The new technology successfully combines machine learning algorithms with a rigorous treatment of the boundary conditions by formulating correspondence between input physical conditions and those in the abstract, high-dimensional data space handled by machine learning algorithms.\nThis was realized by embedding the computational methods of physical simulations in a machine learning algorithm, which is a unique feature of this technology. This time, the research group succeeded in showing the possibility that machine learning can have the same versatility as conventional physical simulation without losing the advantages of machine learning.\nThis technology is expected to accelerate the evaluation process by simulating flow phenomena, which can be a bottleneck in design and manufacturing, and improve the efficiency of the entire design and manufacturing processes.

Further experiments, however, showed that light actually behaves as both a wave and as particles\u2014revealing its quantum nature.\nThese experiments had a profound impact on quantum physics, revealing the dual particle and wave nature of not just light, but other \"particles\" including electrons, neutrons, and whole atoms.\nNow, a team led by Imperial College London physicists has performed the experiment using \"slits\" in time rather than space. They achieved this by firing light through a material that changes its properties in femtoseconds (quadrillionths of a second), only allowing light to pass through at specific times in quick succession.\nLead researcher Professor Riccardo Sapienza, from the Department of Physics at Imperial, said, \"Our experiment reveals more about the fundamental nature of light while serving as a stepping-stone to creating the ultimate materials that can minutely control light in both space and time.\"\nDetails of the experiment are published today (April 3) in Nature Physics.\nThe original double-slit setup involved directing light at an opaque screen with two thin parallel slits in it. Behind the screen was a detector for the light that passed through.\nTo travel through the slits as a wave, light splits into two waves that go through each slit. When these waves cross over again on the other side, they \"interfere\" with each other. Where peaks of the wave meet, they enhance each other, but where a peak and a trough meet, they cancel each other out. This creates a striped pattern on the detector of regions of more light and less light.\nLight can also be parceled up into \"particles\" called photons, which can be recorded hitting the detector one at a time, gradually building up the striped interference pattern. Even when researchers fired just one photon at a time, the interference pattern still emerged, as if the photon split in two and traveled through both slits.\nIn the classic version of the experiment, light emerging from the physical slits changes its direction, so the interference pattern is written in the angular profile of the light. Instead, the time slits in the new experiment change the frequency of the light, which alters its color. This created colors of light that interfere with each other, enhancing and canceling out certain colors to produce an interference-type pattern.\nThe material the team used was a thin film of indium-tin-oxide, which forms most mobile phone screens. The material had its reflectance changed by lasers on ultrafast timescales, creating the \"slits\" for light. The material responded much quicker than the team expected to the laser control, varying its reflectivity in a few femtoseconds.\nThe material is a metamaterial\u2014one that is engineered to have properties not found in nature. Such fine control of light is one of the promises of metamaterials, and when coupled with spatial control, could create new technologies and even analogs for studying fundamental physics phenomena like black holes.\nCo-author Professor Sir John Pendry said, \"The double time slits experiment opens the door to a whole new spectroscopy capable of resolving the temporal structure of a light pulse on the scale of one period of the radiation.\"\nThe team next want to explore the phenomenon in a \"time crystal,\" which is analogous to an atomic crystal, but where the optical properties vary in time.\nCo-author Professor Stefan Maier said, \"The concept of time crystals has the potential to lead to ultrafast, parallelized optical switches.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRomain Tirole et al, Double-slit time diffraction at optical frequencies, Nature Physics (2023).

   "text": "When atomic nuclei such as gold or lead nuclei collide at high energy in particle colliders, they can produce quark\u2013gluon plasma (QGP)\u2014a hot and dense state of matter predicted to have existed shortly after the Big Bang. One of the key features of QGP formation in such heavy-ion collisions is a long-range spatial correspondence, or correlation, between the particles that are created in the collisions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis collective phenomenon, which manifests as a ridge-like shape in data plots and is known as the ridge, was first observed in 2005 in heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the US, and has since been observed at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in smaller collision systems such as collisions between protons.\nAt the Rencontres de Moriond conference today, the ALICE collaboration reported the observation of a ridge correlation in the simplest collision system yet. The result brings physicists a step closer to finding the origin of QGP-like collective phenomena in small collision systems.\nThe first observation of a ridge correlation in collisions other than heavy-ion collisions was made in 2010 by the CMS collaboration in \"high-multiplicity\" proton collisions that produce a relatively large number of particles. Soon after, CMS, ALICE and ATLAS observed the phenomenon also in collisions between protons and lead nuclei. These observations came as a surprise\u2014such collision systems were expected to be too small and simple to develop QGP-like collective behavior. Further studies have shown that the observed ridge correlations are indeed collective in nature, but the exact mechanisms that underpin this collective behavior in these smaller and simpler systems remain to be identified.\nIn its latest study, the ALICE collaboration set out to investigate whether a ridge correlation also occurs in \"low-multiplicity\" proton collisions that create a relatively small number of particles. The ALICE researchers analyzed a large sample of proton collisions recorded by the collaboration during the second run of the LHC to investigate how the ridge effect depends on the number of particles produced in the collisions. They then plotted in a graph the number of particle pairs produced in a set of low-multiplicity collisions along two angular directions relative to the collision axis, and found a clear ridge-like shape.\nNext, the ALICE team examined how the number of particle pairs associated with the ridge varied with multiplicity, and compared the results with previous results from electron\u2013positron collisions recorded by the ALEPH experiment at the Large Electron\u2013Positron Collider, the LHC's predecessor. This comparison showed that, for the same multiplicity, the ridge correlation in proton collisions is stronger than that deduced for electron\u2013positron collisions, in which no ridge correlation has so far been seen.\nThese new ALICE results, as well as future studies based on data from the third run of the LHC, should help physicists identify the mechanisms that govern collective behavior in small collision systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tALICE collaboration: alice-collaboration.web.cern.ch/\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCERN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tALICE collaboration sees long-range spatial correspondence in simplest collisions yet (2023, April 3)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tretrieved 15 June 2023\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom https://phys.org/news/2023-04-alice-collaboration-long-range-spatial-correspondence.html\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This document is subject to copyright.

They have developed a concrete method to compute correlation functions among fluctuations on expanding universe by making use of holography.\n\"We came to realize that our method can be applied more generically than we expected while dealing with quantum gravity,\" says Yasuaki Hikida, from the Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Witten diagrams for three- and four-point functions.

Researchers could recreate this phenomenon in the lab, but they could not fully explain how and why lightning produced X-rays.

Called spark discharge, it occurs when a voltage difference is created between a body and a conductor. In a series of lab experiments in the 1960s, scientists discovered that spark discharges produce X-rays\u2014just as lightning does. More than 60 years later, scientists are still conducting lab experiments to better understand the mechanism underpinning this process.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Schematics of one-dimensional simulation domain and principal physical processes.

Researchers have created simulations and models to explain the TGF observations, but there is a mismatch between simulated and actual sizes, according to lead author Victor Pasko, Penn State professor of electrical engineering. Pasko and his team mathematically modeled the TGF phenomenon to better understand how it can occur in observed compact space.\n\"The simulations are all very big\u2014usually several kilometers across\u2014and the community has difficulty reconciling this right now with actual observations, because when lightning propagates, it's very compact,\" Pasko said, explaining that lightning's space channel is typically several centimeters in scale, with electric discharge activity producing X-rays expanding around tips of these channels up to 100 meters in extreme cases. \"Why is that source so compact? It's been a puzzle until now. Since we're working with very small volumes, it may also have implications for the lab experiments with spark discharges underway since the 1960s.\"\nPasko said that they developed the explanation for how an electric field amplifies the number of electrons, driving the phenomenon. The electrons scatter on individual atoms, which constitute the air, as they experience acceleration. As the electrons move, most of them go forward as they gain energy and multiply, similar to a snow avalanche, allowing them to produce more electrons. As the electrons avalanche, they produce X-rays, which launch the photons backward and produce new electrons.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"From there, the question we wanted to answer mathematically was, \"What is the electric field you need to apply in order to just replicate this, to launch just enough X-rays backwards to allow amplification of these select electrons?'\" Pasko said.\nThe mathematical modeling established a threshold for the electric field, according to Pasko, which confirmed the feedback mechanism that amplifies the electron avalanches when X-rays emitted by the electrons travel backward and generate new electrons.\n\"The model results agree with the observational and experimental evidence indicating that TGFs originate from relatively compact regions of space with spatial extent on the order of 10 to 100 meters,\" Pasko said.\nIn addition to describing high-energy phenomena related to lightning, Pasko said the work may eventually help to design new X-ray sources.

   "text": "Holography, invented by Gabor, provides an approach for recording and reconstructing the complete information (i.e. intensity and phase) of the light from an object. Since its invention, holographic-related technologies have been widely applied in numerous areas, such as optical display, imaging, data storage, encryption and metrology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a new paper published in Light: Science & Applications, a team of scientists led by Professors Yueqiang Hu and Huigao from Hunan University and Zhenwei Xie from Shenzhen University developed a unique method for applying angular momentum (AM) holography for information multiplexing.\nHolography based on conventional optical devices such as spatial light modulators (SLM) suffers from the disadvantages of low resolution and small field-of-view, hindering its practical applications. On the other hand, scientists can access the high resolution, ultra-thin thickness, and high-performance counterpart by replacing the conventional components with metasurfaces.\nMetasurfaces, composed of two-dimensional subwavelength arrays of nanoscale scatters, allow for manipulating lights with multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs). It provides a new generation of versatile platforms for optical multiplexing holography.\nIn this context, different physical dimensions of light, such as wavelength, incidence angle, state of polarization (SoP) and time, have been exploited as independent information channels for holographic systems. Having almost exhausted the existing physical dimensions for multiplexing holography, the AM dimension of light has emerged as a new opportunity.\nThe optical AM, a quantum mechanical description of the photon, has boosted numerous applications in both classical and quantum optical fields, including optical tweezers, the spin-Hall effect, and quantum microscopy. The AM is categorized as orbital angular momentum (OAM) and spin angular momentum (SAM).\nUsing appropriate spatial frequency sampling of a hologram in momentum space, OAM has been implemented as an independent information carrier for optical holography. OAM-multiplexed holography shows unprecedented capacity for optical information processing due to the unbounded helical mode and intrinsic orthogonality. The linear polarization channels are added to the OAM-dependent holography, further enhancing the information capacity. The SAM has also been explored for multiplexing holography, ranging from spin-dependent to spin-decoupled.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nNumerous efforts have been devoted to generating full-polarization vectorial holography. It can offer unlimited multiplexing channels in principle due to the capacity to control the arbitrary polarization vectors on the Poincare sphere (PS), showing great potential for high-capacity optical encryption. Adding the SAM dimension to the existing OAM-multiplexed holography and spatially manipulating the full-polarization vectors simultaneously has not yet been investigated.\nThe most intuitive design approach is segmenting or interleaving several kinds of meta-atoms, each corresponding to a specific functionality. Such methods will restrict its efficiency and introduce undesirable cross-talks. To overcome these drawbacks, a metasurface consisting of non-interleaved meta-atoms would be an excellent choice. However, the realization of AM holography using either the interleaved or the non-interleaved strategies has remained elusive.\nThe research team have theoretically and experimentally proven the AM-holography paradigm based on full synergy of the SAM and OAM via a minimalist metasurface. The design methodology of AM-holography depends on independently controlling the two spin eigenstates and arbitrarily overlaying them in each operation channel. This has thereby spatially modulated the resulting waveform at will.\nThe research team demonstrates an AM meta-hologram that can reconstruct two sets of distinct holographic images to prove the concept. These is the spin-orbital locked (SOL) and spin-superimposed (SS) ones, resulting in the multi-dimensional and multi-channel holography determined by the incident AM. The multi-channel AM meta-holograms have offered additional security locks, allowing us to construct the advanced optical nested encryption platform to revolutionize the existing optical encryption schemes that suffered from limited data capacity or low security.\nIn the optical nested encryption strategy, the SOL and SS holographic images are employed to encrypt and decrypt the optical information in a specific sequence, making the encoded information invulnerable to certain brute-force attacks.\nThe nested encryption scheme theoretically owns unbounded information channels from the AM holography, catering to the ever-growing requirement of parallel high-security information transmission. It is worth noting that the design strategy is generalized and can be extended to achieve other waveform shaping functionalities such as spatial structured-light generation and polarization knots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHui Yang et al, Angular momentum holography via a minimalist metasurface for optical nested encryption, Light: Science & Applications (2023).

The symmetric and antisymmetric supermodes in the ring resonator system have frequency splitting of 2\u03ba=\u03a9/3=2\u03c0\u20226.67 MHz (\u2126 is the free spectral range) and are connected by the electro-optic phase modulator (EOM), which provides bichromatic sinusoidal modulations at different amplitudes. The supermodes act as synthetic lattice sites, with alternating hopping amplitudes g1 and g2.\nThe topologically non-trivial and trivial transmission cases can be converted flexibly by the external modulation. The Zak phase to be measured can be obtained theoretically by integrating the Berry curvature over the first Brillouin zone and take two values, which are 0 for the topologically trivial case and \u03c0 for the topologically non-trivial case, respectively.\nTo implement the proposal in the experiment, the projected band structure of the synthetic lattice is obtained through the time-resolved band structure spectroscopy by collecting the drop-port transmission spectrum through the output fiber coupler via linearly scanning the frequency of the input laser source.\nA data-analysis scheme called resonant method is applied to extract the geometric phases encoded in the bulk band due to projections of the band structures onto superpositions of the two supermodes with the frequency difference as the lattice sites in the frequency dimension.\nThe proposal is validated in experiments performed at the telecom wavelength, where distinguishable time-resolved transmission spectra in the non-trivial and trivial phases are obtained. Zak phase values (\u223c 0 and 0.98\u03c0) are then extracted in different topological phases with a good fit between the simulation results and the experimental measurements.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Experimental observed band structures and measured phases (blue circles) extracted from the chosen bands indicated by red arrows, compared with theoretical results (red lines), with modulation amplitudes (a)g\u2081\uff1cg\u2082 (non-trivial case) and (b) g\u2081\uff1eg\u2082 (trivial case), respectively.

   "text": "Gigahertz femtosecond lasers are suited to enhance and regulate laser machining quality to engineer the physicochemical properties of materials. Materials scientists seek to understand the laser-material interactions by gigahertz femtosecond lasers, although the method is complex due to the associated ablation dynamics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a new report now published in Science Advances, Minok Park and a team of scientists in laser technologies and mechanical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, studied the ablation dynamics of copper using gigahertz femtosecond bursts via time-resolved scattering imaging, emission imaging and emission spectroscopy.\nResearchers have combined several methods to reveal the process of Gigahertz femtosecond bursts, which rapidly removed molten copper from an irradiated spot, for material ejection. The process of material ejection stopped after burst irradiation due to the limited amounts of remnant matter to provide insights into the mechanisms of complex ablation triggered via Gigahertz femtosecond bursts that are employed to select optimal laser conditions in cross-cutting processes, nano-/micro-fabrication and spectroscopy.\nGigahertz and femtosecond laser ablation\nLaser ablation is a process of removing material from surfaces via the interaction of high-power lasers with significant impact across energy harvesting and storage, biomedicine, optoelectronics and spectroscopy. Materials scientists have achieved significant capacities to offer a direct, one-step, chemical-free pathway for material machining and ablation sampling by using ultrafast, femtosecond laser ablation. The process is suited to precisely regulate the ablation features.\nIn this study, Park and colleagues developed a variety of methods to examine real-time laser ablation dynamics. They studied the ablation of copper with a gigahertz femtosecond laser pulse and compared the outcomes to femtosecond pulse ablation. The combined methods resulted in the fast removal of molten liquid material, while halting material removal after burst irradiation. The researchers obtained direct insights into the dynamics and dominant mechanism of gigahertz ablation with femtosecond pulses.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe ultrafast laser experiments\nDuring the experiments, the team used an optical system to investigate the ablation mechanisms of copper with a single femtosecond laser pulse and gigahertz femtosecond bursts under atmospheric pressure. Using time-resolved scattering and emission images, the researchers visualized light emitting and non-emitting species. They characterized the crater morphology with white light interferometry and scanning electron microscopy to ablate a pristine copper surface to a depth of 500 nm. The scientists noted the appearance of irregular, resolidified structures on the irradiated spot. The ablation efficiency of the gigahertz bursts improved by manifolds compared to single-pulse irradiation.\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Single-pulse fs laser irradiation.

The images revealed the ejection of two different particle types from the substrate including those released after different timescales: (1) after a 0\u2013200 nanoseconds delay, and (2) those ejected between 300 nanoseconds to 4 microseconds.\nThe researchers explored time-resolved emission imaging and spectroscopy alongside images of ablated plumes induced via gigahertz bursts composed of 50 pulses. They noted spherically shaped copper plasmas for a period of 30 nanoseconds during the experiments.\nLaser-ablation dynamics\nAfter a time period of 200 nanoseconds, the team did not observe ejecta at the center of the laser-matter interaction zone; indicating that the target was not ablated further. This behavior distinctly differed from the dynamics of single-pulse ablation.\nThe team devised two contributing mechanisms to the underlying process of material ejection, including (1) the vaporization of materials at the center, and (2) the ejection of liquid form the molten pool edge via fast, radially outward fluid motion, to recoil pressure exerted by vaporization. While the copper nanoparticles were expelled from the edge of the molten pool, a limited amount of liquid remained freezing on the crater surface, which they verified using scanning electron microscopy.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Summary of ablation dynamics.

When they released the scattering images at a timescale later than 300s, the ejecta showed how the irradiation spot cooled down to inhibit materials removal.\nThe researchers compared the two experimental conditions and further studied the early ablation dynamics of copper driven by gigahertz bursts to note distinctly different ablation dynamics of a gigahertz burst driven with 200 pulses, compared to the gigahertz burst with 50 pulses. The outcomes provided direct confirmation of the different mechanisms of gigahertz-directed laser-induced ablation when compared to single-pulse irradiation.\nOutlook\nIn this way, Minok Park and colleagues observed the ablation dynamics of copper by using single femtosecond laser pulses and gigahertz bursts with 50\u2013200 pulses via multimodal probing methods. The single-pulse femtosecond laser irradiation produced two types of particles with different ejection speeds at different timescales.\nThe outcomes provide insights to comprehensively understand ablation mechanisms underlying gigahertz femtosecond bursts that are critical to explore a variety of applications across laser processing, machining, printing and spectroscopic diagnostics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMinok Park et al, Mechanisms of ultrafast GHz burst fs laser ablation, Science Advances (2023).

   "text": "Researchers at University of Tokyo, JTS PRESTO, Ludwig Maximilians Universit\u00e4t and Kindai University recently demonstrated the modulation of an electron source by applying laser light to a single fullerene molecule. Their study, featured in Physical Review Letters, could pave the way for the development of better performing computers and microscopic imaging devices.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"By irradiating a sharp metallic needle with femtosecond pulses, we had previously demonstrated optical control of electron emission sites on a scale of approximately 10 nm,\" Hirofumi Yanagisawa, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org. \"The optical control was achieved using plasmonic effects, but it was technically difficult to miniaturize such an electron source using the same principle. We were seeking a way to miniaturize the electron source and we hit upon the idea of using a single molecule and its molecular orbitals.\"\nYanagisawa and his colleagues set out to realize their idea experimentally using electrons emitted from molecules on a sharp metallic needle. However, they were well-aware of the difficulties they would encounter, due to unresolved difficulties associated with the use of electron emissions from molecule-covered needles.\n\"For one, it was not clear whether electron emissions originate from single molecules or not, and beyond that, the interpretation of the emission patterns was not clear,\" Yanagisawa explained. \"Although there were mysteries that we had to clarify, we thought that light-induced electron emissions from molecule-covered needles would be a new phenomenon anyway, if we could observe this, and that the phenomena would give us answers to those intractable questions.\"\nOne year after they started conducting their experiments, the researchers successfully observed light-induced changes in electron emission patterns. Understanding the physics underpinning this observed phenomenon, required an additional four years of research.\nTo miniaturize a site-selective electron source via the so-called plasmonic effect, researchers first need to change the shape of an electron emitter at an atomic scale, which is a highly technical and challenging task. Instead of changing the shape of the emitter, therefore, Yanagisawa and his colleagues tried to change the electronic structure (i.e., molecular orbital) of electrons passing through their single-molecule emitter.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"In this case, the electronic structure in a single molecule defines a sort of aperture for incoming electron waves, where the shape of the outgoing electron waves will become the shape of the aperture,\" Yanagisawa said. \"For example, if the aperture is a ring shape, the outgoing electron waves also become a ring shape. The important thing is that the aperture's shape varies with the energy of the incoming electrons in quantum mechanics.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                Fig. 2. Conceptual diagrams of turnout switches for trains (a) and electrons (b). Credit: Yanagisawa et al\n             \n\n\nEssentially, the researchers were able to change the shape of the aperture on their emitter by exciting electrons with laser pulses and changing their energies. This in turn changed the shape of the emitted electron waves.\n\"We observed subnanometric modulation in electron emission sites by light,\" Yanagisawa said. \"Optically selecting emission sites can lead to an integration of ultrafast switches that can be from three to six orders of magnitude faster than switches in a computer.\"\nThe technique introduced by the researchers could theoretically enable the integration of ultrafast switches into a single fullerene molecule. Yanagisawa and his colleagues also propose an integration scheme that would allow the integration of as many switches as desired without the need to increase the size of devices, which would generally be necessary.\nIn their next studies, they would like to further improve their ability to control electron emission using their technique, as this could facilitate the future integration of ultrafast switches into single molecules. In addition, they plan to explore the possibility of applying their method to electron microscopy technology.\nIn addition to informing the creation of vacuum nanoelectronics, in fact, their proposed method could be applied in the field of electron microscopy. The irradiation of solids using light can excite electrons within them, and some of these electrons can then be emitted into a vacuum; a process known as photoelectron emission.\n\"A photoelectron emission microscope (PEEM) can be used to observe femtosecond to attosecond electron dynamics on a nanoscale area,\" Yanagisawa said. \"Ultrafast electron dynamics play an important role, even at a single-molecule scale. However, the spatial resolution of a PEEM is around sub-10 nm or so, and hence, it was not possible to resolve electron dynamics in a single molecule.\"\nThe modulation of light-induced electron emissions from a single molecule demonstrated by this team of researchers can be combined with PEEM technology. Yanagisawa and his colleagues showed that a PEEM based on their approach attains a spatial resolution of approximately 0.3 nm, while also resolving single-molecule molecular orbitals.\n\"In the future, we will be using our microscope to investigate ultrafast electron dynamics in a single molecule,\" Yanagisawa added. \"Because our PEEM uses low-energy electrons, we expect less damage to biomolecules so that we can observe a specific biomolecule without destroying it. Femtosecond electron dynamics play a crucial role even in photosynthesis, thus we would soon like to investigate the photosynthetic process at a single-molecule scale using our PEEM.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHirofumi Yanagisawa et al, Light-Induced Subnanometric Modulation of a Single-Molecule Electron Source, Physical Review Letters (2023).

This process, which powers the sun and stars, could be a green way to create electricity on Earth without producing greenhouse gases or long-lived radioactive waste.\nThe scientists from PPPL, a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratory managed by Princeton University, have measured the dense cloud of plasma produced by a strong laser striking a solid target. The intense heat caused atoms from the surface to evaporate and emit energetic X-ray light.\nThe measurement gauged the speed of the light using the Doppler effect\u2014the same phenomenon that causes ambulance sirens to rise in pitch as they approach and then fall as they move away. Meteorologists rely on this effect to measure the speed of thunderstorms.\nPhysicists want to gain a better understanding of dense plasma in part because it is produced by inertial confinement fusion devices\u2014facilities like the DOE's National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory that last year produced more fusion power than the energy it took to heat the plasma. The more physicists can understand the behavior of the resulting dense plasma, which is ten billion times denser than the plasma inside doughnut-shaped magnetic tokamaks, the more likely they could create fusion more efficiently.\nThe scientists found evidence for the existence of a barrier, or sheath, between the outer and inner layers of the dense plasma cloud. This observation suggests that laser-produced dense plasma behaves similarly to less-dense plasma. The finding marks the first time scientists have used this Doppler technique to measure very dense plasma. The experiment was performed using Colorado State University's Advanced Laser for Extreme Photonics (ALEPH) facility.\nThe results show that dense plasma behaves much like other types of plasmas do, behavior that scientists have not been able to directly observe until now, reported Frances Kraus, lead author of a paper reporting the results in Physical Review Letters.\nPrior to this finding, researchers did not know whether they could measure X-rays with precision in dense plasma, which can obscure such observations. \"Scientists did not believe that you could pick out the X-ray behavior within all of the other signals,\" Kraus said. \"But our diagnostic shows that you can.\"\nInvented in 1960, lasers are used for a wide range of tasks, including surgery, welding, and printing. A laser\u2014the term stands for \"light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\"\u2014consists of rays of light that all have the same consists of rays of light that all have the same frequency. In addition, the photon particles that make up laser light are all traveling in the same direction and orientation. As lasers have become more powerful, there has grown a need to understand their fundamental characteristics.\n\"You have to understand what these lasers create before you can find uses for them,\" Kraus said. \"This is fundamental stuff. These super-powerful lasers will have lots of applications in the future.

But one of the greatest challenges to developing commercially viable quantum computers is the ability to scale them up from a hundred or so qubits to millions of qubits.\nIn terms of technologies, one of the front-runners to achieve large-scale quantum computing is silicon quantum dots that are a few tens of nanometers in diameter. A key advantage is that they can be fabricated using existing silicon fabrication technology. But one hurdle is that, while it is straightforward to connect two quantum dots that are next to each other, it has proved difficult to link quantum dots that are far from each other.\n\"In order to connect many qubits, we have to densely cram many of them into a very small area,\" says Akito Noiri of the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science. \"And it's very hard to use wires to connect such very densely packed qubits.\"\nNow, Noiri and co-workers have realized a two-qubit logic gate between physically distant silicon spin qubits.\n\"While there has been a lot of work in this area using various approaches, this is the first time that anyone has succeeded in demonstrating a reliable logic gate formed by two distant qubits,\" says Noiri. \"The demonstration opens up the possibility of scaling up quantum computing based on silicon quantum dots.\"\nTo connect the two qubits, the team used a method known as coherent spin shuttling, which allows single spin qubits to be moved across an array of quantum dots without affecting their phase coherence\u2014an important property for quantum computers since it carries information. This method involves pushing electrons through an array of qubits by applying a voltage.\nAlthough the physical separation between the two qubits was relatively short, Noiri is confident that it can be extended in future studies. \"We want to increase the separation to about a micrometer or so,\" he says. \"That will make the method more practical for future use.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAkito Noiri et al, A shuttling-based two-qubit logic gate for linking distant silicon quantum processors, Nature Communications (2022).

   "text": "A research team, led by Professor Yuji Nakamura of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Toyohashi University of Technology, discovered that the flickering of flames can be freely controlled by moving two flames closer together or further apart. Until now, it had been known that interference between flames separated by a certain distance causes the flames to flicker during in-phase or anti-phase. However, it was not possible to stably express the state of \"stopping the flickering of flames\" that should occur under critical conditions where the phase changes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research team has succeeded in stably expressing the state of \"stopping the flickering of flames\" by periodically adjusting the distance between flames. This makes it possible to freely control the flickering of the flames, and to elucidate the essence of flickering flames. The research is published in the journal Physical Review Applied.\nThe flickering of flames is a familiar phenomenon that is easy to observe. At the same time, it is also a mysterious and interesting phenomenon with vast complexity. For example, once flickering flames have interfered with each other, only the stable flickering mode is selectively expressed. Depending on the distance between the flames, the \"in-phase mode\" that fluctuates in the same phase and the \"anti-phase mode\" that fluctuates in the opposite phase are selectively expressed. There are also mysterious phenomena such as different fluctuation frequencies in those modes. Using these guidelines, it is possible to achieve various fluctuating states.\nAnd yet, there is no example that shows \"stopping the flickering by interfering with the fluctuating flames.\" In the past, it was shown that this state can be achieved by arranging three flames (known as \"death mode\" in reference to the complete absence of movement). However, researchers have yet to understand the reason why death mode cannot be achieved with two flames.\nWhen examining this phenomenon, the research team found that the death mode is expressed by adjusting the distance between the two flames closer or further apart in a certain cycle.\n\"When conducting experiments involving flame-to-flame interference, flickering will temporarily stop if the flames are gradually brought closer or further apart,\" explains Dr. Ju Xiaoyu, lead author and researcher at the time of the project. \"However, if the flames are kept in that position, they will eventually start flickering again.\n\"Since the flames eventually flicker, we know that flickering is a stable state. The fact that there is a delay period until the flames settle into a stable state means that if we can create a situation where flickering can be stopped within that time scale, the flickering should be stopped permanently. We were able to prove that this prediction is correct by periodically adjusting the distance between flames closer and further apart. We also demonstrated that the reason for this phenomenon can be explained by hydrodynamic properties. Moving forward, we will proceed with research aimed at constructing a theory.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCondition when flames are moved. Credit: Toyohashi University of Technology.\n\n\"It has been known that the flame flickering mode is determined by interference between flames,\" says Professor Yuji Nakamura, leader of the research team. \"Researchers in applied physics have attempted to explain this phenomenon as nonlinear physics instead of combustion engineering. Nevertheless, their explanation felt inadequate to me due to its failure to consider hydrodynamics. In response, I began to earnestly research this theme.\n\"I was amazed to witness a phenomenon in which flickering temporarily stopped in an intermediate state between in-phase and anti-phase flickering. I felt a strong desire to elucidate this mysterious transition state, a theme which has not been addressed by previous research. From the beginning, I had the idea of constantly adjusting the distance between flames to take advantage of the time delay until they settled into a stable state. Ultimately, I was able to organize this method with the help of Dr. Ju.\"\nProfessor Nakamura concludes, \"Introducing this phenomenon at events such as academic conference is sure to capture the interest of the audience without exception. However, the audience will, without exception, raise questions regarding examples of practical application. For example, 'How can these findings be used?' I repeatedly answered such questions by posing my own question\u2014'Actually, I only began researching this phenomenon out of personal curiosity, so I'd like to ask how you think my findings can be used?'\n\"This experience has led me to start my research presentations by asking the audience to refrain from questions on practical application. I believe that one appeal of conducting basic research at a university is being able to purely immerse yourself in curiosity, without the need to consider practical application.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nFuture outlook\nAlthough the research team is not considering practical application of their research at the present time, they plan to delve deeper into the theme not only through experiments, but also through numerical and theoretical analyses. This will be done in the name of basic research that is unique to universities; that is, through the elucidation of mysterious phenomenon.\nThe team plans to proceed as international joint research in collaboration with Dr. Ju and many international researchers who have expressed interest in their research. Through the international dissemination of research seeds originating in Japan, the team would like to convey to the world that this kind of (currently impractical) basic research can be pursued vigorously in Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tXiaoyu Ju et al, Flame Flickering can Cease Under Normal Gravity and Atmospheric Pressure in a Horizontally Moving Dual Burner System, Physical Review Applied (2023).

   "text": "Materials typically conduct electricity or insulate against it\u2014so experimental and theoretical physicists have been captivated by a compound called samarium hexaboride (SmB6) that appears to do both. Numerous studies over the course of 50 years have revealed that SmB6 acts like an insulator as well as an electricity-conducting metal.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, researchers from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) say it's possible to image the exact position of electrons along the surface of SmB6 with single-atom precision, enabling a breakthrough in understanding the compound's properties and why it can both insulate and conduct. The findings, published in Science, build upon SEAS research reported in 2019 that determined that SmB6 is a topological insulator\u2014meaning it conducts electricity along its surfaces but not its insides.\nDespite the 2019 discovery about SmB6's surface metallicity, many questions remained about its overall metallicity and why different measurements didn't generate consistent results.\n\"Anyone with a voltmeter should be able to tell you whether a material is conductive or insulating,\" says Harris Pirie, first author of the paper and a former Ph.D. student in the lab of Clowes Professor of Science Jenny Hoffman at SEAS. But that was never the case with SmB6. \"That intrigued us and thrust SmB6 even further into the spotlight within the physics community.\nTo understand the peculiar behavior of how electrical charges move within SmB6, Pirie and collaborators from University of Oxford, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), and other institutions needed to develop a new imaging approach to detect the distribution of electrons on SmB6.\nIn conversations with Dirk Morr of UIC, the team homed in on the idea of adapting a scanning tunneling microscope, which uses an unimaginably small needle tip to measure atomic structures on the surface of a material. Instead of measuring atomic structure, they used it to detect a magnetic resonance in SmB6 at a cold temperature, a signature of the magnetic interactions that turn the would-be metal into a low-temperature insulator. \"That magnetic interaction generates a clear resonance we can measure, and we predicted that if we could measure its excitation energy at different surface points, it would reveal the electronic charge at that position,\" Pirie says.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nScanning the needle across the surface of SmB6 to map out the electronic charges across all surface points, the team created a readout that \"looks like a topographic map you would have of a mountain range,\" Pirie says. Except those mountain peaks and valleys are the size of atoms.\nUsing this method, the team has captured the first picture of electrons accumulating around atomic defects on SmB6's surface\u2014even surfaces created by cross-sectioning a sample of SmB6 into fragments. \"It was clear right from the moment we took that measurement, we had found the electrons we were looking for,\" Pirie says. \"We saw these amazing wave patterns that the electrons formed around the defects, indicating a high signal-to-noise ratio. It was a very cool moment.\"\n\"The work gives us new understanding of the importance of single atom defects in topological materials,\" says Hoffman, the paper's senior author.\nPirie is now looking to modify the scanning tunneling microscope method to build new quantum devices. \"The atomic defects we've identified could be useful in building quantum circuits. The needle of the scanning tunneling microscope can come so ridiculously close to the sample material that it's no longer passively imaging it\u2014it can touch and change the sample,\" he says. \"I'm interested in seeing if we can move atoms around on SmB6, pushing all the electrons into specific, controlled channels or puddles. The hope is that by strategically constructing atomic defects on SmB6, electrons could be precisely trapped to form qubits\u2014the basic units necessary for quantum computing.\"\nThat might help solve a major barrier to a workable quantum computer: to operate stably, the quantum state of a a quantum computer's qubits must be entirely prohibited from entangling with electrons in the surrounding environment.\nThe imaging method could give scientists a powerful high-resolution tool to see what electrons are doing on various materials and compounds, Pirie says. \"This tool can look at what the electric charge around just one atom is doing\u2014allowing us to see the world at a smaller scale. There are so many fundamental questions this could help us answer about the world around us.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHarris Pirie et al, Visualizing the atomic-scale origin of metallic behavior in Kondo insulators, Science (2023).

   "text": "In recent months, the neutrino research facility at the European laboratory CERN has been bustling with activity. Scientists, engineers and technicians from around the world have gathered there to assemble a large prototype of a new particle detector to study the neutrino, one of the most mysterious types of particles in the universe.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeutrinos are everywhere, but they rarely interact with matter. Each second, trillions of these particles traverse our bodies and leave without a trace. By studying these ghost-like particles, physicists hope to answer questions, such as: Why is the universe made of matter? What is the relationship between the four forces of nature? How are black holes formed in the aftermath of an exploding star?\nResearchers working on the international Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy's Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, hope to solve these mysteries. Their work on the prototype detector at CERN brings them a step closer to achieving this goal.\nThe infrastructure needed for DUNE is expansive. It includes a new particle accelerator at Fermilab, which will produce a neutrino beam that will pass through 1,300 kilometers of earth before reaching the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota. At SURF, these particles will be greeted by the DUNE far detector, a gigantic subterranean detector housed 1.5 kilometers below the surface. The detector will comprise huge detector modules containing argon, an element whose highly stable nature makes it perfect for studying neutrinos. Excavation of the underground caverns for the DUNE far detector is about 60% complete.\nTesting new technology\nMembers of the DUNE collaboration, which includes scientists and engineers from more than 35 countries, are busy at work designing, testing and building the components of the first two DUNE detector modules to be installed at SURF. Module one will be a horizontal drift detector, which is based on a tried-and-tested technique that will be scaled up for DUNE. The mass production of components for this first module already has begun. The second module, known as the vertical drift detector, will feature new technology. Testing has been ongoing for the last two years.\n\"I expect exciting physics out of both the horizontal and vertical drift detectors,\" said Steve Kettell, the technical coordinator for the vertical drift detector, based at the DOE's Brookhaven National Laboratory. \"But the vertical drift technology opens up significant opportunities for building additional detectors that are lower in cost and easier to install.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nHorizontal vs. vertical\nOn a basic level, horizontal and vertical drift detectors work in the same way. When a neutrino interacts with an argon atom inside the detector's liquid-argon-filled chamber, the particles produced in this interaction release electrons. A strong electric field between opposite sides of the detector chamber pushes these loose electrons to an anode, a large structure that detects the arrival of charged particles. In a horizontal drift detector, the electric field exists between two opposing walls, and the electrons drift horizontally; in a vertical drift detector, the electric field runs between the bottom and top of the detector, and the electrons drift vertically. The argon-neutrino interaction also produces a brief flash of light that both detectors capture with a separate photon detection system.\n\"Fundamentally, there's nothing different about vertical drift and horizontal drift,\" Kettell explained. \"We are detecting neutrino events in essentially the same manner.\"\nThe differences are in the details. The anode of the horizontal drift detector consists of large planes of tightly wound wires, known as anode plane assemblies, or APAs. They are 6 meters tall and 2.3 meters wide. The anode of the vertical drift detector, on the other hand, will be composed of charge readout planes, or CRPs. They are large, perforated-printed circuit boards that are 3 meters by 3.5 meters in size and have copper strips printed onto their surfaces. Like the wires in the APAs, the copper strips in the CRPs will collect the drifting electrons.\nThe DUNE vertical drift detector will feature multilayer CRPs at the top and at the bottom. \"The CRPs have perforated 2.5-millimeter holes, so that electric charge can pass through and go to another layer to get collected,\" said Dominique Duchesneau, leader of the CRP consortium and a physicist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research. Each CRP layer has differently orientated copper strips, he added, which \"gives you the possibility to have multiple views of the electrons.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                This newly designed high-voltage extender helps create a 300,000-volt electric field between the top and bottom of the vertical drift prototype detector. Credit: DUNE collaboration\n             \n\n\nA key advantage of CRPs is that because they are made of simple metal-plated circuit boards rather than a tight coil of wires, they are cheaper and easier to manufacture and install than APAs.\n\"With the vertical drift detector, we're trying to demonstrate that we can build a less expensive detector that works equally well,\" Kettell said.\nBecause the vertical drift detector technology requires fewer elements than the horizontal drift, it provides a larger active volume. A larger active volume means that there will be more space in which particle interactions can be collected, said In\u00e9s Gil-Botella, a DUNE physics coordinator based at the Centre for Energy, Environmental and Technological Research in Spain. \"You're maximizing the possibility of seeing neutrino interactions in this liquid argon.\"\nAnother innovation is the photon detection system DUNE scientists plan to build for the vertical drift detector, an upgrade of the ARAPUCA technology developed for the first DUNE far detector module. This new system will cover all four cryostat walls as well as the cathode with photon detection modules. (In contrast, in the horizontal drift detector, the photon detectors only are embedded in the APA planes, behind the wires.) To power and read out the photo sensors on the high-voltage cathode, which is set to 300 kilovolts, the vertical drift team uses a powerful laser that provides power via optical fibers.\nIn addition, the argon within the vertical drift detector will be doped with xenon to enhance the number of photons that get detected when particles interact with atoms in the liquid \u2014and to enhance the uniformity of light detection throughout the chamber. Together, these features will make this photon detection system more capable of detecting low-energy physics events, such as those triggered by supernovae or solar neutrino events, Gil-Botella said.\nA bustle of activity\nThe team working on the DUNE vertical drift detector comes from around the world. Major contributions are being made by CERN, France, Italy, Spain and the U.S. But members also come from several other countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America. \"There's been tremendous progress on many fronts,\" said Kettell.\nThis group has been busy. To date, they have successfully tested small-scale, 32-centimeter-by-32-centimeter CRPs in a 50-liter liquid-argon-filled chamber fitted with a cathode, electronics and a photon detection system. This early prototype was able to collect data from cosmic-ray tracks with \"good signal-to-noise performance,\" said Kettell. They have also tested full-size, 3-meter by 3.5-meter CRPs with the cathode, electronics, and the photon detection system in a large coldbox at CERN.\nThe team has demonstrated that the components of the vertical drift detector could read out signals at 300 kilovolts\u2014the high voltage that will be needed for creating the electric field in the full-sized DUNE detector. They have also shown that electrons can drift six meters\u2014the maximum distance electrons will travel in the final-size module\u2014and use the CRPs to receive these tracks. \"The next big milestone we'll face is the installation of all of the systems together at a larger scale,\" Gil-Botella said.\nThe team is now assembling parts into a larger vertical drift prototype, dubbed \"vertical drift module-0,\" in a large cryogenic vessel at CERN, about the size of a small house. This prototype will contain two full-sized CRPs on both the top and bottom of the detector, with the cathode installed in the middle, as well as an advanced photon detection system. Electrons knocked loose in the upper half of the detector will drift upward toward the CRP set at the top, and electrons produced in the lower half will drift in the down direction, until they reach the CRP layers at the bottom. CRP development has been led by France, with the construction of the top CRPs in France and the bottom CRPs in the U.S.\nThe DUNE researchers aim to complete the installation of the vertical drift prototype detector in spring 2023. Once complete, the team will fill the detector with liquid argon and turn it on, so that scientists can observe the tracks left by particle beams and cosmic rays that pass through it.\nUltimately, the goal is to have the components of the vertical drift detector ready to be installed in one of the large caverns in South Dakota in 2027.\n\"What I really would like to see is the installation of the first CRPs in the big cryostat at SURF, which will come in several years,\" Duchesneau said. \"In the meantime, I think module-0 running and taking data in the real configuration of the vertical drift is a very exciting step.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFermi National Accelerator Laboratory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDUNE collaboration tests new technology for second detector module (2023, March 31)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tretrieved 15 June 2023\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom https://phys.org/news/2023-03-dune-collaboration-technology-detector-module.html\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This document is subject to copyright.

   "text": "Preparations for the construction of the first detector module of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment are rapidly progressing. Members of the international DUNE collaboration have begun the final tests of detector components that will be shipped to South Dakota. There they will become part of a one-of-a-kind experiment designed to study some of the most elusive particles in the universe: neutrinos.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDUNE is an experiment aimed at exploring the nature of neutrinos. Scientists hope that unlocking the secrets of these particles will shed light on some of the biggest mysteries in physics, such as why the universe is made of matter and how neutron stars and black holes are forged in the aftermath of exploding stars.\nDUNE, hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy's Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, will be housed at two locations: the Fermilab site in Illinois and the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota. The far detector, an enormous structure envisioned to ultimately comprise four modules, will be located 1.5 kilometers underground at SURF. Each module will be a liquid-argon time projection chamber, or LArTPC, designed to be filled with 17,000 tons of argon, an element commonly found in air that is ideal for studying neutrinos.\nThe first DUNE detector module to be built at SURF will employ horizontal drift technology. When neutrinos collide with the argon atoms inside the module, they will produce charged particles. These charged particles knock out electrons as they travel through the argon. The electrons are attracted by a strong electric field towards anode plane assemblies, or APAs, which record a projection of where the electrons were produced. By measuring the timing of when electrons hit the APAs, scientists are able to reconstruct three-dimensional particle tracks.\nWhen complete, the first detector module will contain 150 APAs, each a large rectangular plane approximately 2.3 meters by 6 meters in size and composed of tightly wound copper-beryllium wires. \"We are going to effectively plaster a wall with a grid of wires,\" said Justin Evans, a professor of physics at the University of Manchester. He is leading the effort to build APAs in the U.K.\nThe technology for the first module was successfully tested in a scaled-down version called ProtoDUNE at the CERN Neutrino Platform in 2019. Although it was only one-twentieth of the size to the final DUNE detector module, it still was the largest LArTPC ever constructed and operated.\n\"That was the first time that we in the U.K. built any of these wire grids and took data from them,\" said Evans. \"And they worked wonderfully.\"\nIn addition to proving that the detector technology would work, the horizontal drift prototype revealed where design improvements could be made. With this in mind, scientists designed ProtoDUNE II, an upgraded prototype that will undergo tests at CERN this year.\n\"With a prototype, there's always lessons learned,\" said Thomas Wieber, the installation team leader at CERN. \"We want to prove that what we think is going to work better actually does work better.\"\nDUNE scientists are also working on developing the technology for a vertical drift detector, which is the planned technology for the second far detector module. Preparations for testing the new technology in a separate prototype detector, known as vertical drift module-0, are underway at CERN as well.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nTesting the full assembly process\nTesting all aspects of the horizontal drift module assembly also involves ensuring that all the detector components, which come from DUNE collaborators around the world, will arrive safely. To ensure this process goes smoothly, ProtoDUNE II also has served as a testbed for the installation process. The groups involved in manufacturing the detector components brought all their test parts together at CERN to assemble and test the prototype.\n\"We have had collaborators coming in from all over the world,\" said Daniela Macina, the installation coordinator for the horizontal drift detector at CERN. \"This is the first time we've integrated and installed the final DUNE horizontal drift detectors all together.\"\nProtoDUNE II contains four APAs. All four were tested in a cold box filled with super-cold gaseous nitrogen in order to ensure that the electronics function properly at frigid temperatures. All four APAs passed the test. They then were assembled in the ProtoDUNE II cryostat, along with other parts of the prototype. These parts include the electronics and light sensors, which identify photons that are released when neutrinos interact with the liquid argon in the detector.\n\"We needed to assemble things according to a procedure that will be as close as possible to the one we'll use in South Dakota,\" Macina said.\nLater this year, the team will fill ProtoDUNE II with liquid argon and shoot a beam of particles through the detector to test it. \"We don't expect big surprises, because there were only minor changes between ProtoDUNE and ProtoDUNE II,\" said Macina.\nAs the final work on ProtoDUNE II takes place at CERN, scientists are also ramping up production of the APAs that will be installed at SURF. Of the 150 APAs that will be installed in the first module of the far detector, 136 APAs will be produced at the Daresbury Laboratory in the U.K., and another 14 will be produced at the University of Chicago.\nTo support the mass production of these parts, the Daresbury Laboratory in the U.K. has constructed an APA factory where the team has set up four production lines, each with six-meter-long machines for winding the wires around steel frames to create the APAs.\n\"We have four of those set up, all working in parallel,\" Evans said. \"We're trying to get to the point where each production line can produce one APA every two months.\"\nShipping detector components to South Dakota\nActivities related to the detector installation have also started up in South Dakota, where the excavation of the caverns for the DUNE far detector are about 60% complete. In early November, the team shipped one of the APAs from the first prototype at CERN to SURF for a logistics test. The process of transporting the long, rectangular APA from Europe to the United States, offloading the structure, then lowering it a mile below the ground through a relatively narrow mineshaft was successfully completed.\n\"We're using older APAs to validate those procedures so that we're not going to damage anything when we start bringing the real APAs to SURF,\" said Fermilab scientist Eric James, a technical coordinator who focuses on DUNE's horizontal drift detector.\nDespite all the details that need to be worked out to bring the first DUNE detector module to life, DUNE scientists are not losing sight of their ultimate goal: exploring a new frontier of neutrino science.\n\"I'm hugely excited about what we will see when we switch this thing on,\" Evans said. \"There is so much the neutrino can tell us about the universe.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFermi National Accelerator Laboratory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDUNE collaboration ready to ramp up mass production for first detector module (2023, March 31)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tretrieved 15 June 2023\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom https://phys.org/news/2023-03-dune-collaboration-ready-ramp-mass.html\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This document is subject to copyright.

The underlying mechanism of the newly observed phenomenon involves the unique role of dark-autoionizing states through coupling with other pertinent electronic states.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to this work, the team will be able to study the ultrafast dynamics of a single dark autoionizing state at the femtosecond timescale, which was previously impossible due to its inability to undergo single-photon emission or absorption, combined with the ultrashort lifetime of these states.\nRecently published in the journal Physical Review Letters, their results allow the generation of ultrafast extreme ultraviolet light relevant for advanced ultrafast science applications such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and photoemission electron microscopy.\nThis work was done in collaboration with Professor Vasily Strelkov at the Prokhorov General Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia, and Research Assistant Professor Muhammad Ashiq Fareed at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA.\nUnraveling the mysteries of the dark-autoionizing states\nIn their laboratories at the \u00c9nergie Mat\u00e9riaux T\u00e9l\u00e9communications Research Centre, Professors Tsuneyuki Ozaki and Fran\u00e7ois L\u00e9gar\u00e9, along with Ph.D. student Mangaljit Singh, have been exploiting special types of electronic states, known as dark-autoionizing states. Their work was accomplished using high-order harmonic generation, an optical phenomenon unconventional to laser physics.\n\"The newly published results are a step forward not only in understanding the behavior of dark autoionizing states under intense ultrafast laser-matter interactions, but also in bringing intense extreme-ultraviolet laser sources from large-scale synchrotron and free-electron laser facilities to the moderate-sized laser laboratories,\" says Ph.D. student Mangaljit Singh, first author of the study.\nMany limitations imposed by the fundamentals of laser physics restrict most lasers used in medicine, communications, or industry. Likewise, they tend to operate only in the ultraviolet, visible (from violet to red), or the invisible near and mid-infrared wavelength range. However, many advanced scientific applications require lasers to operate at shorter wavelengths in the extreme ultraviolet range.\nThe state-of-the-art systems employ commercially available primary laser sources for high-order harmonic generation from noble gases to develop secondary sources of coherent extreme ultraviolet light.\nIn this study, instead of noble gases, Singh and colleagues used a laser-ablated plume (obtained from the laser ablation of a solid material) for the high-order harmonic generation in sync with the unique response of dark-autoionizing states.\nThey found that under certain resonance conditions governed by the primary laser parameters and the electronic structure of the atomic and ionic species in the laser-ablated plume, the conversion efficiency, and hence the power of the extreme ultraviolet laser source is enhanced by more than ten times. This implies that the same extreme ultraviolet power can be obtained using a primary laser with power that is one-tenth of the power required for a typical noble gas.\nIn addition to providing an intense extreme ultraviolet light source, this study also shows for the first time the prospect of studying the dynamics of dark autoionizing states at the femtosecond timescale using the technique of high harmonic spectroscopy. Such dark states could be the basis of several quantum technologies, especially in improving the performance of quantum computation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMangaljit Singh et al, Ultrafast Resonant State Formation by the Coupling of Rydberg and Dark Autoionizing States, Physical Review Letters (2023).

They introduce a potential landscape of much larger length scale than the crystal periodicity of the constituent 2D layers, providing a novel paradigm for engineering band structures and hence a plethora of exotic quantum phenomena.\nFor instance, the moir\u00e9 potential landscape can fold the electronic band structure into a mini-Brillouin zone, resulting in the formation of flat bands and a rich phase diagram of strongly correlated and topological states, such as superconductivity, orbital magnetism, Wigner crystal states, Chern insulator states and quantum simulators.\nWhen moir\u00e9 superlattices couple with light, they open up unprecedented possibilities for catching the first glimpse of many emergent photonic and optoelectronic phenomena. For example, moir\u00e9 superlattices offer a powerful strategy for engineering excitonic quasiparticles in both real and momentum spaces, giving rise to quantum-dot-like moir\u00e9 excitons and Bragg-umklapp moir\u00e9 excitons, respectively.\nTriggered by the breakthrough of moir\u00e9 excitons, a plethora of fascinating photonic and optoelectronic properties have been witnessed in moir\u00e9 superlattices over the past few years with unprecedented speed, including but not limited to moir\u00e9 excitons/polaritons, resonantly hybridized excitons, reconstructed collective excitations, strong mid-/far-infrared photoresponses, terahertz single-photon detection, and symmetry-breaking optoelectronics.\nThe new degree of freedom afforded by using moir\u00e9 superlattices provides new paradigms for engineering light-matter interactions for numerous applications, such as versatile quantum light sources, ultralow-threshold broadband excitonic lasing and intelligent infrared sensors.\nThe researchers also discussed future opportunities and research directions in this field, such as developing advanced techniques for probing emergent photonics and optoelectronics in an individual moir\u00e9 supercell, exploring new ferroelectric, magnetic, and multiferroic moir\u00e9 systems, and using external degrees of freedom to engineer moir\u00e9 properties, thus resulting in exciting physics and potential technological innovations.\n\"The dizzying pace of recent achievements suggests that we are just starting down the path of exploring moir\u00e9 photonics and optoelectronics,\" said Prof. Du Luojun from IOP, first author of the study. Du also noted that the future progression of the field will undoubtedly bring more surprises and further transform the landscape of basic scientific research and technological innovation in physics, materials science, optical quantum technologies, energy harvesting, information and beyond.

It is based on the ability to allow and stop the flow of electrons through a material. Spin electronics, or spintronics, is a spinoff. It is based on the spin of electrons, and the fact that the electron spin along with the electric charge creates a magnetic field.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This property could be exploited for building blocks in future computer memory storage, brain-like and other novel computing systems, and high-efficiency microelectronics,\" said Charudatta Phatak, group leader in the Materials Science division at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory.\nA team including researchers at Argonne and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (MagLab) discovered surprising properties in a magnetic material of iron, germanium and tellurium. This material is in the form of a thin sheet that is only a few to 10 atoms in thickness. It is called a 2D ferromagnet.\nThe team discovered that two kinds of magnetic fields can coexist in this ultrathin material. Scientists call them merons and skyrmions. They are like miniature swirling storm systems dotting the flat landscape of the ferromagnet. But they differ in their size and swirling behavior.\nKnown and studied for about 15 years, skyrmions are about 100 nanometers in size\u2014approximately the same as a single virus molecule\u2014and their magnetic fields flow in complicated patterns, resembling those of the strands of a knot in a rope. Only recently discovered, merons are roughly the same size and have magnetic fields that swirl around like whirlpools.\n\"Both skyrmions and merons are very stable because like firmly tied knots, they are difficult to untangle,\" said Luis Balicas, who holds a joint appointment at MagLab and Florida State University. \"This stability along with their magnetic properties makes them attractive as carriers of information.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                Evolution of magnetization as a function of the temperature in single crystalline Fe5-xGeTe2.

Also, merons remained present up to room temperature, an important consideration to exploit them in practical devices. In the past, they had only been observed at much lower temperature in different materials.\nThe team also showed that skyrmions and merons are detectable from their effect on an applied current, by measuring the voltage. This feature means they are adaptable to the binary code used in all digital computers. This code consists of combinations of 1 and 0. In a spintronic device, a 1 would be indicated by an electrical signal detecting a skyrmion or meron. The absence of an electrical signal would then convey a 0.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nDetecting and characterizing the different magnetic textures in a film fewer than ten atoms thick required a special scientific tool. Argonne physicist Yue Li led that challenging task using an instrument called a Lorentz transmission electron microscope (TEM). This microscope includes aberration correction technology to improve its resolution. This TEM can visualize the magnetization of materials at the nanoscale under different magnetic fields over a wide temperature range, a unique capability available at Argonne. The range extends from minus 280 Fahrenheit to room temperature.\nThe team performed additional magnetic and other imaging at Argonne's Center for Nanoscale Materials, a DOE Office of Science user facility.\n\"Much more basic research is needed to fully understand the behavior of skyrmions and merons under different conditions, and how to employ them in coding information,\" Balicas said. \"Many seemingly science fiction schemes are out there.

In contrast to completely disordered systems, one defining feature of turbulent flows is the existence of coherent structures, which are spatial-temporally correlated over a range of scales.\nIt has long been known that these coherent structures are the primary carriers for mass, momentum, and heat transport in turbulence. However, owing to the inherent characteristics of turbulent flows, such as strong nonlinearity and strong dissipation, how to manipulate coherent structures to control turbulent transport has been a long-standing issue.\nIn the past decade, Prof. Xia's team have made significant progresses in this issue. By conducting a series of studies in a canonical thermal turbulence system, namely the turbulent Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard convection, they discovered a new mechanism of tuning turbulent heat transport via coherent structure manipulation through simple geometrical confinement.\nUnder this mechanism, the heat transfer efficiency is controlled by the coherency of thermal structures (characterized by their geometrical properties), rather than the turbulence intensity.\nAs a result, the heat transport efficiency can be significantly enhanced even the resultant flow is much slower. Very importantly, this mechanism is fundamentally different from the prevalent heat-management approach based on the classical view of wall-bounded turbulence, which usually centers on directly modifying the diffusion-dominant boundary layer to enhance or inhibit turbulent heat transfer.\nIn the review article, Prof. Xia and his collaborators introduced, and explained in detail, the physical picture behind this newly discovered mechanism, and discussed its potential applications in passive thermal management (such as electronics cooling).\nMoreover, by introducing additional examples of thermal turbulence systems that are subject to various dynamical processes (including rotation, double-diffusion, magnetic field, tilting, modification by polymer additive and so on), they further demonstrate how the framework of coherent structure manipulation can be generalized to understand heat transport behaviors in seemingly different turbulence systems in a unified way. This universal mechanism is expected to be realized in other types of turbulent flows.\nThis review article also covers other important progresses in this research topic and outlines some future directions. These not only provide new understanding for the communities of turbulence research and heat transfer, but also promote the design and development of engineering systems with tunable transport efficiencies.\nThe work is published in National Science Review.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKe-Qing Xia et al, Tuning Heat Transport Via Coherent Structure Manipulation: Recent Advances in Thermal Turbulence, National Science Review (2023).

Tuning and controlling Rashba interactions is a particularly promising technology, as it can potentially be integrated directly into functional logic and memory devices.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nScientists and engineers need devices that can process information efficiently with ultra-low power consumption. Recently, there have been new developments in logic and memory devices that use the spin of electrons, in addition to their electronic charge, to store and process information. To accomplish this, the device architecture needs a strong interaction between the spin of electrons and their orbital moments.\nThis coupling, known as Rashba effect, allows for easy manipulation of spin currents and can lead to lower energy consumption. In particular, it can facilitate voltage-driven magnetization switching for logic and memory computing with reduced energy consumption, as proposed by Intel. However, to be useful in this regard, this effect must be significantly large even at zero applied voltages, and this has been difficult to realize in traditional semiconducting and metallic systems.\nThe research team led by Professor Ariando from the Department of Physics, NUS, demonstrated that lattice polarization and the trapping of interfacial charge carriers can result in a large Rashba spin-orbit effect at the oxide material interface in the absence of an external bias. Their findings have now been published in Physical Review Letters.\nOxide systems have great potential for exploiting the Rashba effect because their multiple degrees of freedom (charge, spin, orbital, and lattice) are entangled with one another. Under Prof. Ariando's guidance and with the support of the research team, Dr. Ganesh Ji Omar, the lead author of the paper, came up with a new and different methodology for controlling the Rashba effect in oxide material systems.\nIn their experiments, the researchers developed two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at LaAlO3-SrTiO3 interfaces and buffered by a LaFeO3 carrier modulating layer. All individual oxide layers during the fabrication process were controlled in real time and the resulting structures were validated using high-resolution electron microscopy. This heterostructure led to significant enhancement of Rashba effect at the correlated LaAlO3-SrTiO3 interfaces even when no external voltage was applied. This remarkable enhancement effect was explained using a framework of \"orbital hybridization of interfacial electronic wave functions\" at oxide interfaces (see figure above). The theoretical research team further validated this unconventional Rashba effect using density functional theory.\nProf. Ariando said, \"This work highlights the fundamental role of lattice polarization in achieving the observed enhancement of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and is particularly promising for efficient spin-to-charge conversion. Moreover, it can lead to the discovery of various other exotic properties, such as spiral magnetism, topological superconductivity, and intrinsic spin Hall effect.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tG.

It is made up of particles that simultaneously form a rigid crystal and yet at the same time flow without friction since all the particles belong to the same single quantum state.\nA solid becomes \"super\" when its quantum properties match the well-known quantum properties of superconductors. A supersolid simultaneously has two orders, solid and super:\nSolid because of the spatially repeating pattern of particles.Super because the particles can flow without resistance.\n\"Although a supersolid is rigid, it can flow like a liquid without resistance,\" explains Lead author Dr. Sara Conti (University of Antwerp).\nThe study was conducted at UNSW (Australia), University of Antwerp (Belgium) and University of Camerino (Italy) and has been published in Physical Review Letters.\nA 50-year journey toward the exotic supersolid\nGeoffrey Chester, a Professor at Cornell University, predicted in 1970 that solid helium-4 under pressure should at low temperatures display:\nCrystalline solid order, with each helium atom at a specific point in a regularly ordered lattice and, at the same time,Bose-Einstein condensation of the atoms, with every atom in the same single quantum state, so they flow without resistance.\nHowever in the following five decades the Chester supersolid has not been unambiguously detected.\nAlternative approaches to forming a supersolid-like state have reported supersolid-like phases in cold-atom systems in optical lattices. These are either clusters of condensates or condensates with varying density determined by the trapping geometries. These supersolid-like phases should be distinguished from the original Chester supersolid in which each single particle is localized in its place in the crystal lattice purely by the forces acting between the particles.\nThe new Australia-Europe study predicts that such a state could instead be engineered in two-dimensional (2D) electronic materials in a semiconductor structure, fabricated with two conducting layers separated by an insulating barrier of thickness d.\n\n\n\n\n\n                The phase diagram's triple point is particularly intriguing. There should be exciting physics coming from the exotic interfaces separating these domains. Credit: FLEET\n             \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne layer is doped with negatively-charged electrons and the other with positively-charged holes.\nThe particles forming the supersolid are interlayer excitons, bound states of an electron and hole tied together by their strong electrical attraction. The insulating barrier prevents fast self-annihilation of the exciton bound pairs. Voltages applied to top and bottom metal \"gates\" tune the average separation r0  between excitons.\nThe research team predicts that excitons in this structure will form a supersolid over a wide range of layer separations and average separations between the excitons. The electrical repulsion between the excitons can constrain them into a fixed crystalline lattice.\n\"A key novelty is that a supersolid phase with Bose-Einstein quantum coherence appears at layer separations much smaller than the separation predicted for the non-super exciton solid that is driven by the same electrical repulsion between excitons,\" says co-corresponding author Prof. David Neilson, University of Antwerp.\n\"In this way, the supersolid pre-empts the non-super exciton solid. At still larger separations, the non-super exciton solid eventually wins, and the quantum coherence collapses.\"\n\"This is an extremely robust state, readily achievable in experimental setups,\" adds co-corresponding author Prof. Alex Hamilton (UNSW). \"Ironically, the layer separations are relatively large and are easier to fabricate than the extremely small layer separations in such systems that have been the focus of recent experiments aimed at maximizing the interlayer exciton binding energies.\"\nAs for detection, for a superfluid it is well known that this cannot be rotated until it can host a quantum vortex, analogous to a whirlpool. But to form this vortex requires a finite amount of energy, and hence a sufficiently strong rotational force. So up to this point, the measured rotational moment of inertia (the extent to which an object resists rotational acceleration) will remain zero. In the same way, a supersolid can be identified by detecting such an anomaly in its rotational moment of inertia.\nThe research team has reported the complete phase diagram of this system at low temperatures.\n\"By changing the layer separation relative to the average exciton spacing, the strength of the exciton-exciton interactions can be tuned to stabilize either the superfluid, or the supersolid, or the normal solid,\" says Dr. Sara Conti.\n\"The existence of a triple point is also particularly intriguing. At this point, the boundaries of supersolid and normal-solid melting, and the supersolid to normal-solid transition, all cross. There should be exciting physics coming from the exotic interfaces separating these domains, for example, Josephson tunneling between supersolid puddles embedded in a normal-background.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSara Conti et al, Chester Supersolid of Spatially Indirect Excitons in Double-Layer Semiconductor Heterostructures, Physical Review Letters (2023).

   "text": "What does quantum mechanics, the most successful theory ever proposed by physics, teach us about reality? The starting point for most philosophers of physics is that quantum mechanics must somehow provide a description of the world as it is independently of us, the users of the theory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has led to a large number of incompatible worldviews. Some believe the implication of quantum mechanics is that there are parallel worlds as in the Marvel Comic universe; some believe it implies signals that travel faster than light, contradicting all that Einstein taught us. Some say it implies that the future affects the past.\nAccording to QBism, an approach developed by Christopher Fuchs and me, the great lesson of quantum mechanics is that the usual starting point of the philosophers is simply wrong. Quantum mechanics does not describe reality as it is by itself. Instead, it is a tool that helps guide agents immersed in the world when they contemplate taking actions on parts of it external to themselves.\nThe use of the word \"agent\" rather than the familiar \"observer\" highlights that quantum mechanics is about actions that participate in creating reality, rather than observations of a reality that exists independently of the agent.\nQBism and its homophone, the art movement Cubism, share the understanding that reality is more than what a single agent's perspective can capture. However, unlike the art movement, QBism does not attempt to represent reality. It does not attempt to bring the different perspectives together in one \"third-person\" view. QBism is fundamentally anti-representational and first person.\n Rescuing free will\nThis puts QBism in direct contradiction with the two pillars of the 19th-century conception of a mechanistic universe. One is that nature is governed by physical laws in the same way that a mechanical toy is governed by its mechanism. The other is that it is, in principle, possible to have an objective view of the universe from the outside\u2014from a God's eye or third-person standpoint.\nThis mechanistic vision is still dominant among 21st-century scientists. For instance, in their 2010 book The Grand Design, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow write: \"It is hard to imagine how free will can operate if our behavior is determined by physical law, so it seems that we are no more than biological machines and that free will is just an illusion.\"\nInstead, the QBist vision is that of an unfinished universe, of a world that allows for genuine freedom, a world in which agents matter and participate in the making of reality.\nA key aspect of quantum mechanics is randomness. Rather than making firm predictions, quantum mechanics is concerned with the probabilities for potential measurement outcomes. The physicist Ed Jaynes famously expressed that to understand quantum mechanics, one has to understand probability first.\nIn this spirit, QBism's starting point is the personalist Bayesian approach to probability (originally a method of statistical inference and now a fully fledged theory of decision making under uncertainty). In this approach, probabilities are an agent's personal degrees of belief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo rather than describing the statistics of some experiment, probabilities provide guidance to agents on how they should act. In other words, probabilities are not descriptive but \"normative\"\u2014analogous to an instruction manual. It turns out that the standard probability rules can be derived from the (normative) principle that one's probabilities should fit together in a way that guards against a sure loss when used for making decisions.\nQBism's great insight was that the probabilities that appear in quantum mechanics are no different. They are not, as in the standard view, fixed by physical law, but express an agent's personal degrees of belief about the consequences of measurement actions the agent is contemplating.\nIn QBism, the role of the quantum laws is to provide extra normative principles about how an agent's probabilities should fit together. Rather than providing a description of the world, the rules of quantum mechanics are an addition to the standard probability rules; to classical (non-quantum) decision theory. They assist physicists in decisions such as how to design a quantum computer in order to minimize the probability of error, or what atoms to use in an atomic clock in order to increase the precision of time measurements.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurements are actions\nJust like \"observer\", the term \"measurement\" can be misleading because it suggests a pre-existing property that is revealed by the measurement. Instead, a measurement should be thought of as an action an agent takes to elicit a response from the world. A measurement is an act of creation that brings something entirely new into the world, an outcome that is shared between the agent and the agent's external world.\nQuantum mechanics is often depicted as \"weird\" and hard, or indeed impossible, to understand. As a matter of fact, the weirdness of quantum mechanics is an artifact of looking at it the wrong way. Once the two main QBist insights\u2014that the quantum rules are guides to action and that measurements do not reveal pre-existing properties\u2014are taken on board, all quantum paradoxes disappear.\nTake Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, for example. In the usual formulation, the unfortunate animal is described by a \"quantum state\" taken to be a part of reality and implying that the cat is neither dead nor alive.\nThe QBist, by contrast, does not regard the quantum state as a part of reality. The quantum state a QBist agent might assign has no bearing on whether the cat is alive or dead. All it expresses is the agent's expectations concerning the consequences of possible actions they might take on the cat. Unlike most interpretations of quantum mechanics, QBism respects the fundamental autonomy of the cat.\nOr take quantum teleportation. According to a common way of presenting this operation, a particle's quantum state, again regarded as a part of reality, disappears at one place (A) and mysteriously reappears at another (B)\u2014quite literally as in a transporter in the Star Trek science fiction series.\nFor a QBist, however, nothing real is transported from A to B. All that happens in quantum teleportation is that an agent's belief about the particle at A becomes, after the operation, the same agent's belief about a particle at B. The quantum state that expresses the agent's belief about the particle at A initially is mathematically identical to the quantum state that expresses that same agent's belief about the particle at B after the operation. Quantum teleportation is a powerful tool used in applications such as quantum computing, but in QBism there is nothing counter-intuitive or weird about it.\nQBism is an ongoing project. It spells out clearly the meaning of all mathematical objects in the theory and is thus a fully developed interpretation of quantum mechanics. Yet, QBism is also a program for developing new physics and has already yielded deep insights even if it is still a work in progress.\nQBism has also led to a fruitful dialogue with the kindred philosophical schools of thought of pragmatism and phenomenology. Its vision of the world is one in which agents possess genuine freedom and respect each other's autonomy. I like to think that this is what quantum mechanics has been trying to tell us about reality all along.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProvided by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Conversation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

   "text": "Nuclear physicists may have finally pinpointed where in the proton a large fraction of its mass resides. A recent experiment carried out at the U.S. Department of Energy's Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility has revealed the radius of the proton's mass that is generated by the strong force as it glues together the proton's building block quarks. The result was recently published in Nature.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest mysteries of the proton is the origin of its mass. It turns out that the proton's measured mass doesn't just come from its physical building blocks, its three so-called valence quarks.\n\"If you add up the Standard Model masses of the quarks in a proton, you only get a small fraction of the proton's mass,\" explained experiment co-spokesperson Sylvester Joosten, an experimental physicist at DOE's Argonne National Laboratory.\nOver the last few decades, nuclear physicists have tentatively pieced together that the proton's mass comes from several sources. First, it gets some mass from the masses of its quarks, and some more from their movements. Next, it gets mass from the strong force energy that glues those quarks together, with this force manifesting as \"gluons.\" Lastly, it gets mass from the dynamic interactions of the proton's quarks and gluons.\nThis new measurement may have finally shed some light on the mass that is generated by the proton's gluons by pinpointing the location of the matter generated by these gluons. The radius of this core of matter was found to reside at the center of the proton. The result also seems to indicate that this core has a different size than the proton's well-measured charge radius, a quantity that is often used as a proxy for the proton's size.\n\"The radius of this mass structure is smaller than the charge radius, and so it kind of gives us a sense of the hierarchy of the mass versus the charge structure of the nucleon,\" said experiment co-spokesperson Mark Jones, Jefferson Lab's Halls A&C leader.\nAccording to experiment co-spokesperson Zein-Eddine Meziani, a staff scientist at DOE's Argonne National Laboratory, this result actually came as somewhat of a surprise.\n\"What we have found is something that we really weren't expecting to come out this way. The original goal of this experiment was a search for a pentaquark that has been reported by researchers at CERN,\" Meziani said\nThe experiment was performed in Experimental Hall C in Jefferson Lab's Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility, a DOE Office of Science user facility. In the experiment, energetic 10.6 GeV (billion electron-volt) electrons from the CEBAF accelerator were sent into a small block of copper. The electrons were slowed down or deflected by the block, causing them to emit bremsstrahlung radiation as photons. This beam of photons then struck the protons inside a liquid hydrogen target. Detectors measured the remnants of these interactions as electrons and positrons.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe experimenters were interested in those interactions that produced J/\u03a8 particles amongst the hydrogen's proton nuclei. The J/\u03a8 is a short-lived meson that is made of charm/anti-charm quarks. Once formed, it quickly decays into an electron/positron pair.\nOf the billions of interactions, the experimenters found about 2,000 J/\u03a8 particles in their cross section measurements of these interactions by confirming the coincident electron/positron pairs.\n\"It's similar to what we've been doing all along. By doing elastic scattering of the electron on the proton, we've been getting the proton's charge distribution,\" said Jones. \"In this case, we did exclusive photo-production of the J/\u03a8 from the proton, and we're getting the gluon distribution instead of the charge distribution.\"\nThe collaborators were then able to insert these cross section measurements into theoretical models that describe the gluonic gravitational form factors of the proton. The gluonic form factors detail the mechanical characteristics of the proton, such as its mass and pressure.\n\"There were two quantities, known as gravitational form factors, that we were able to pull out, because we had access to these two models: the generalized parton distributions model and the holographic quantum chromodynamics (QCD) model. And we compared the results from each of these models with lattice QCD calculations,\" Meziani added.\nFrom two different combinations of these quantities, the experimenters determined the aforementioned gluonic mass radius dominated by graviton-like gluons, as well as a larger radius of attractive scalar gluons that extend beyond the moving quarks and confine them.\n\"One of the more puzzling findings from our experiment is that in one of the theoretical model approaches, our data hint at a scalar gluon distribution that extends well beyond the electromagnetic proton radius,\" Joosten said. \"To fully understand these new observations and their implications on our understanding of confinement, we will need a new generation of high-precision J/\u03a8 experiments.\"\nOne possibility for further exploration of this tantalizing new result is the Solenoidal Large Intensity Device experiment program, called SoLID. The SoLID program is still in the proposal stage. If approved to move forward, experiments conducted with the SoLID apparatus would provide new insight into J/\u03a8 physics.\n\"The big next step is to measure J/\u03a8 production with the SoLID detector. It will really be able to make high-precision measurements in this region. One of the major pillars of that program is J/\u03a8 production, along with transverse momentum distribution measurements and parity-violating deep inelastic scattering measurements,\" Jones said.\nJones, Joosten and Meziani represent an experimental collaboration that includes more than 50 nuclear physicists from 10 institutions. The spokespeople also want to highlight Burcu Duran, the lead author and a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Duran featured this experiment in her Ph.D. thesis as a graduate student at Temple University, and she was a driving force behind the analysis of the data.\nThe collaboration conducted the experiment over about 30 days in February\u2013March 2019. They agree that this new result is intriguing, and they say that they all are looking forward to future results that will shed additional light on the glimpses of new physics that it implies.\n\"The bottom line for me\u2014there's an excitement right now. Could we find a way to confirm what we are seeing? Is this new picture information going to stick?\" Meziani said. \"But to me, this is really very exciting. Because if I think now of a proton, we have more information about it now than we've ever had before.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tZein-Eddine Meziani, Determining the gluonic gravitational form factors of the proton, Nature (2023).

Such materials get their name due to a property that allows them to hold an electric charge and then to release it when stress is applied. These materials are currently used in products such as sonar equipment, guitar pickups and cellphone speakers. In this new research, the pair in Michigan found the first known example of a piezoelectric material that exists in liquid form at room temperature.\nThe researchers were studying properties of ionic liquids, which are made from salts with unsymmetrical, flexible organic cations and symmetrical weakly coordinating anions. Electricity builds up within them and is released when they are pressed or squeezed. The liquid piezoelectric material was discovered as the researchers applied pressure with a piston to a sample of an ionic liquid in a cylinder. To their surprise, they found that this led to the release of electricity. They also found that the amount of electricity released was proportional to the amount of pressure applied. Further testing showed that the optical properties of the ionic liquids changed when they released electricity. In some instances, the researchers found changes in how the liquid bent light.\nThey were not able to explain why the ionic liquids they tested had piezoelectric properties but suggest that applying pressure likely serves to separate charge within the fluid, allowing some to be released. They plan to continue studying the material to better understand why it behaved in the ways they observed.\nThe researchers also suggest that liquid piezoelectric materials could prove to be useful, especially ones made using ionic liquids, because they would be more environmentally friendly than solid materials. They also note that liquid piezoelectric materials could allow more variety in device shape, opening up wider design opportunities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMd.

   "text": "Few things carry the same aura of mystery as dark matter. The name itself radiates secrecy, suggesting something hidden in the shadows of the universe.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA collaborative team of scientists called COHERENT, including Kate Scholberg, Arts & Sciences Distinguished Professor of Physics, Phillip Barbeau, associate professor of Physics, and postdoctoral scholar Daniel Pershey, attempted to bring dark matter out of the shadows of the universe and into a slightly less glamorous destination: a brightly lit, narrow hallway in a basement.\nNot an ordinary basement, though. Working in an area of Oak Ridge National Laboratory nicknamed Neutrino Alley, the team typically focuses on subatomic particles called neutrinos. They are produced when stars die and become supernovas, or, on a more down-to-Earth level, as a by-product of proton collisions in particle accelerators.\nNot coincidentally, Neutrino Alley is located directly underneath one of the most powerful particle accelerators in the world, Oak Ridge's Spallation Neutron Source (SNS). Neutrino Alley houses a collection of detectors specifically designed to observe neutrinos as they pass through and collide with them.\nNeutrinos aren't the only by-product of SNS's operations, though. Dark matter (not to be confused with the movie villain favorite anti-matter) is also produced when particle accelerators crash protons together. Following up on years of theoretical calculation, the COHERENT team set out to capitalize both on SNS's power and on the sensitivity of their neutrino detectors to observe dark matter in Neutrino Alley.\n\"And we didn't see it,\" says Scholberg. \"Of course, if we had seen it, it would have been more exciting, but not seeing it is actually a big deal.\"\nShe explains that the fact that dark matter wasn't observed by their neutrino detectors allows them to greatly refine the theoretical models of what dark matter looks like.\n\"We know exactly how the detector would respond to dark matter if dark matter had certain characteristics, so we were looking for that specific fingerprint.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe fingerprint in question is the way in which the nuclei of the atoms in the neutrino detector recoil when hit by a neutrino, or in this case, by a dark matter particle.\n\"It's like throwing projectiles at a bowling ball on a sheet of ice,\" said Pershey. The bowling balls, in his analogy, are the atoms contained in the neutrino detector\u2014which in this experiment was a 14.6 kg cesium iodide crystal. \"You can tell a lot about the projectile and the force with which it was thrown by how much the bowling ball recoils upon contact.\"\nWhen it comes to dark matter, any information is good information. No one really knows what it is. Almost 100 years ago, physicists realized that the universe couldn't behave the way it did if all it contained was the stuff we can see.\n\"We're floating in a sea of dark matter,\" said Jason Newby, group leader for neutrino research at Oak Ridge National Lab and a co-author of the study. The consensus among physicists is that dark matter makes up to 85% of the mass of the universe. It must be subject to gravity to explain the universe's behavior, but it doesn't interact with any sort of light or electromagnetic wave, appearing dark.\n\"We learned about it by looking at big galaxies rotating around each other, seeing that they rotate way faster than they ought to, implying that they have more mass than they appear to have,\" said Pershey. \"So we know that there's extra stuff out there, we just need to learn where to look for it.\"\n\"Even though we're in the realm of mostly no results,\" said Newby, \"it's really important that everywhere you can look, you look, and then you can rule out a whole number of possibilities and focus on a new area with strategy rather than just using a 'spaghetti on the wall' approach.\"\n\"We're extending our reach for what models for dark matter can exist, and that's very powerful,\" said Scholberg.\nShe points out that the achievement doesn't stop there: the experiment also allowed the team to extend the worldwide search for dark matter in a new way.\n\"The typical detection technology is to go underground, build a very sensitive detector, and wait for these dark matter particles to just pass through,\" said Pershey.\nThe problem? Dark matter particles may be traveling quite leisurely through the air. If they also happen to be very light, they may not reach the detector with enough energy to create a detectable fingerprint.\nThe COHERENT team experimental setup addresses this issue.\n\"When you go to an accelerator, you produce those particles at significantly higher energies,\" said Pershey. \"And that gives them a lot more oomph to knock into nuclei and make the dark matter signal appear.\"\nSo, what now? It's not quite back to the drawing board. Neutrino Alley is currently preparing to receive a much larger and more sensitive detector, which, combined with COHERENT's refined search parameters, will greatly improve the chances of catching one of these devilish particles.\n\"We're at the doorstep of where the dark matter should be,\" said Pershey.\nRelated research is published in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tD.

The most common form of ice, known as ice Ih, has a hexagonal lattice structure, but under certain conditions, ice can form other structures, with 20 different forms found so far.\nIn the case of cubic ice, known as ice Ic, a hundred years ago it was thought to be responsible for a particular type of halo around the sun or moon. In fact, the question of whether cubic ice really exists has long been controversial, as it has been difficult to perfectly detect pure-phase ice Ic in a large number of experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Interstitial Fe impurity (IFI) induced zero bound state (ZBS).

The preferential nucleation of ice Ic on low-temperature substrates was demonstrated.

The study is being conducted using Heliotron J, the latest iteration of experimental fusion plasma devices at the Institute of Advanced Energy, located on KyotoU's Uji campus in south Kyoto.\n\"Initially, we did not expect these phenomena in Heliotron J but were surprised to find that plasmas were forming without cyclotron resonance,\" group leader Kazunobu Nagasaki explains.\nBuilding on decades of experience, Nagasaki's team is exploring the fusion plasma discharges in Heliotron J.\nThe team injected intense bursts of 2.45-GHz microwave power into a feed gas. Microwave ovens in the home operate at this same frequency but Heliotron J is around 10 times more powerful and concentrated over a few gas atoms.\n\"Unexpectedly, we found that blasting the microwaves without alignment of Heliotron J's magnetic field created a discharge that ripped electrons from their atoms and produced an especially dense plasma,\" marvels Nagasaki.\n\"We are extremely grateful that our colleague could continue supporting the study, despite the war in Ukraine.

   "text": "In two new studies, researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have greatly improved the efficiency and power output of a series of chip-scale devices that generate laser light at different colors while all using the same input laser source.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany quantum technologies, including miniature optical atomic clocks and future quantum computers, will require simultaneous access to multiple, widely varying laser colors within a small region of space. For instance, up to six different laser colors are needed for all the steps required for a leading atom-based design for quantum computation, including preparing the atoms, cooling them, reading out their energy states, and performing quantum logic operations.\nTo create multiple laser colors on one chip, NIST researcher Kartik Srinivasan and his colleagues have spent the last few years studying nonlinear optical devices, such as those made of silicon nitride, which have a special property: The color of laser light entering the device can differ from the color that exits. In their experiment, incoming light is converted into two different colors\u2014which correspond to two different frequencies. For instance, near-infrared laser light incident on the material is converted into shorter-wavelength visible laser light (at higher frequency than the source) and longer-wavelength infrared laser light (at lower frequency).\nIn previous work, the team demonstrated that this conversion process, known as optical parametric oscillation, can occur within a silicon nitride microresonator, a ring-shaped device small enough to be fabricated on a chip. The light races around the ring some 5,000 times, building a high enough intensity for the silicon nitride to convert it into the two different frequencies. The two colors are then coupled into a straight rectangular channel, also made of silicon nitride, that lies adjacent to the ring and acts as a transmission line, or waveguide, transporting the light where it is needed.\nThe specific colors generated are determined by the dimensions of the microresonator as well as the color of the input laser light. Because many different microresonators with slightly different dimensions are created during the fabrication process, the technique provides access to a wide range of output colors on a single chip, all using the same input laser.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Srinivasan and his colleagues, which include researchers from the Joint Quantum Institute (JQI), a collaboration between NIST and the University of Maryland, found that the process was highly inefficient. Much less than 0.1 percent of the input laser light was converted into either of the two output colors traveling in the waveguide. The team traced most of the inefficiency to poor coupling between the ring and the waveguide.\nIn the first study, Srinivasan and his NIST/JQI collaborators, led by Jordan Stone, redesigned the straight waveguide so that it was U-shaped and wrapped around a portion of the ring. With this modification, the researchers were able to convert about 15 percent of the incoming light to the desired output colors, more than 150 times the amount in their earlier experiment. In addition, the converted light possessed more than one milliwatt of power over a wide range of wavelengths, from the visible to the near-infrared.\nGenerating a milliwatt of power is a milestone, said Srinivasan, because that amount is usually enough for several applications. For example, it can enable a tiny laser to excite electrons to jump, or transition, from one specific energy level to another inside an atom. Exciting these transitions is part of common protocols for generating quantum states of light, such as single-photon states, from single atoms or atom-like systems such as quantum dots.\nIn addition, milliwatt power levels can be sufficient for laser stabilization. Some atoms have transition energies that are very stable and insensitive to environmental effects, and as a result, provide a good reference by which a laser frequency can be compared and corrected, ultimately improving its noise properties.\nThe researchers reported their results in the December 2, 2022 issue of APL Photonics.\nIn the second study, Srinivasan and his colleagues, led by Edgar Perez, improved the power output and efficiency of the technique even further. By increasing the coupling between the ring and the waveguide and suppressing effects that may interfere with the color conversion, the team increased the output laser power to as high as 20 milliwatts and converted as much as 29 percent of the incident laser light to the output color. Although the colors in this study were limited to the near-infrared, the team plans to extend their work to visible wavelengths.\nThe researchers reported their findings in the Jan. 16, 2023 issue of Nature Communications.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEdgar F.

Though some of these sources of aerosols aren't much of a concern, aerosols originating from industrial sources, such as wastewater treatment plants, and even natural sources, such as sea spray and dust, have the capacity to make more of an impact on the environment and even public health.\nAn aerosol is a suspension of liquid droplets or fine solid particles suspended in the air. Though aerosols are generated in numerous ways, one of the most significant sources is through the bursting of bubbles at the interface between a liquid and the air. Most previous research has focused on \"clean\" bubbles despite contaminated interfaces being more prevalent.\nNew research from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Mechanical Science and Engineering assistant professor Jie Feng and graduate student Zhengyu Yang has shown that bursting bubbles coated by a thin oil layer produce drops with smaller sizes, greater overall number of drops, and are ejected at a higher velocity than bubbles generated in clean water. This research was recently published in Nature Physics.\nAerosols are quite ubiquitous in our environment, and they can be natural or anthropogenic in nature. Bubble-bursting aerosols play a key role in the transfer of mass across liquid interfaces. Sea spray aerosols, for example, are primarily generated by bubble bursting at the ocean surface. The drops that are produced from bubble bursting can impact air pollution, global climate and even the transmission of infectious diseases. One important parameter of these droplets is their size since that is indicative of residence time and transport in the atmosphere\u2014small drops are more easily lifted by winds and can travel much further.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-speed side view of a singular jet from an oil-coated bubble bursting with \u03bco\u2009=\u20094.6\u2009mPa\u2009s and \u03c8o\u2009=\u200910%.

When the bubble rises from deeper water to the surface, it will collect contaminants and form an organic layer around it. We call this a contaminated bubble. When it reaches the surface and bursts, it can actually aerosolize these contaminants into small droplets.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nFeng and Yang investigated the impact a thin layer of oil has on bursting bubbles, as a model system for contaminated bubbles. The bursting of a millimeter-sized bare bubble at an aqueous surface produces drops with a typical size of around 100 micrometers (\u00b5m) (a typical human hair is around 100-200 \u00b5m). In this work, they found that drops can be as small as a few \u00b5m when the bursting bubble is coated by a thin layer of oil. Additionally, bare bubble bursting produces drops with a typical ejection velocity of 1 meter per second (m/s), whereas oil-coated bubble bursting produces drops with an ejection velocity as large as 10 m/s.\nFeng summarizes, \"The main conclusion of our work is that we found, for these contaminated bubbles, they can quite effectively aerosolize the contaminants into micron size droplets.\"\nIn an industrial setting like a wastewater treatment plant, smaller contaminated drops can pose a significant risk to those that work in the plant. Bubble bursting in these settings may generate acidic mists and bioaerosols. Understanding the effect of contaminated bubbles on size distribution and ejection speeds is crucial to designing effective personal protective equipment and implementing additional guidelines on air and water quality near such facilities.\nOn a broader scale, aerosols have an effect on weather, climate, and even human health.\n\"These droplets can transport pathogens, bacteria, and viruses,\" Yang said. \"When you have these small aerosols, and they can be ejected higher, the small size and higher ejection speed can help them stay in the atmosphere for a longer time.\" Understanding size and composition of aerosols is important to improve global modeling efforts. Furthermore, these contaminated drops can pose a greater risk of pollutant spread as well as infection since smaller aerosols are able to penetrate further in the respiratory tract than larger aerosols.\nOther contributors to this work include Bingqiang Ji (co-author, postdoc, MechSE, UIUC) and Jesse T.

Kahn Term Professor in the School of Arts & Sciences, has resulted in a significant breakthrough in detecting neutrinos.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe international collaborative experiment known as Sudbury Neutrino Observation (SNO+), located in a mine in Sudbury, Ontario, roughly 240 km (about 149.13 mi) from the nearest nuclear reactor, has detected subatomic particles, known as antineutrinos, using pure water. Klein notes that prior experiments have done this with a liquid scintillator, an oil-like medium that produces a lot of light when charged particles like electrons or protons pass through it.\n\"Given that the detector needs to be 240km, about half the length of New York state, away from the reactor, large amounts of scintillator are needed, which can be very expensive,\" Klein says. \"So, our work shows that very large detectors could be built to do this with just water.\"\nWhat neutrinos and antineutrinos are and why you should care\nKlein explains that neutrinos and antineutrinos are tiny subatomic particles that are the most abundant particles in the universe and considered fundamental building blocks of matter, but scientists have had difficulty detecting them due to their sparse interactions with other matter and because they cannot be shielded, meaning they can pass through any and everything. But that doesn't mean they're harmful or radioactive: Nearly 100 trillion neutrinos pass through our bodies every second without notice.\nThese properties, however, also make these elusive particles useful for understanding a range of physical phenomena, such as the formation of the universe and the study of distant astronomical objects, and they \"have practical applications as they can be used to monitor nuclear reactors and potentially detect the clandestine nuclear activities,\" Klein says.\nWhere they come from\nWhile neutrinos are typically produced by high energy reactions like nuclear reactions in stars, such as the fusion of hydrogen into helium in the sun wherein protons and other particles collide and release neutrinos as a byproduct, antineutrinos, Klein says, are usually produced artificially, \"for instance, nuclear reactors, which, to split atomic nuclei, produce antineutrinos as a result of radioactive beta decay from the reaction,\" he says. \"As such, nuclear reactors produce large amounts of antineutrinos and make them an ideal source for studying them.\"\nWhy this latest finding is a breakthrough\n\"So, monitoring reactors by measuring their antineutrinos tells us whether they are on or off,\" Klein says, \"and perhaps even what nuclear fuel they are burning.\"\nKlein explains that a reactor in a foreign country could therefore be monitored to see if that country is switching from a power-generating reactor to one that is making weapons-grade material. Making the assessment with water alone means an array of large but inexpensive reactors could be built to ensure that a country is adhering to its commitments in a nuclear weapons treaty, for example; it is a handle on ensuring nuclear nonproliferation.\nWhy this hasn't been done before\n\"Reactor antineutrinos are very low in energy, and thus a detector must be very clean from even trace amounts of radioactivity,\" Klein says. \"In addition, the detector must be able to 'trigger' at a low enough threshold that the events can be detected.\"\nHe says that, for a reactor as far away as 240km, it's particularly important that the reactor contain at least 1,000 tons of water. SNO+ satisfied all these criteria.\nLeading the charge\nKlein credits his former trainees Tanner Kaptanglu and Logan Lebanowski for spearheading this effort. While the idea for this measurement formed part of Kaptanglu's doctoral thesis, Lebanowski, a former postdoctoral researcher, oversaw the operation.\n\"With our instrumentation group here, we designed and built all the data acquisition electronics and developed the detector 'trigger' system, which is what allowed SNO+ to have an energy threshold low enough to detect the reactor antineutrinos.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA.

In this case, the measurement results of the single excitation and the multiple excitations overlap and usually cannot be separated, making it difficult to understand the material.\nTo remedy this, the laser power is usually reduced to such an extent that multiple excitations are less likely than single excitations. However, they cannot be completely avoided and can therefore lead to erroneous interpretations of the data. Even when multiple excitations are themselves the subject of investigation, it is still difficult to distinguish between two, three, four, or even more excitations.\nA complex problem with a simple solution\nA team of physicists and physical chemists from the Julius-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrzburg (JMU) and the University of Ottawa (Canada) has now solved this decades-old problem. They present their method in the current issue of the journal Nature. In the experiment conducted in the group of W\u00fcrzburg professor Tobias Brixner, the researchers used the common method of \"transient absorption\" to track very fast changes in various materials that occur in a millionth of a millionth of a second.\nWhile the standard method uses a single laser power, the researchers used several different powers and combined the data according to a newly derived formula. In this way, they were able to systematically separate the effects from single to six-fold excitation.\n\"Not so long ago, I wouldn't have thought that such a distinction was even possible,\" Brixner says, \"especially with such a simple procedure that any spectroscopic research group can implement and use without much additional effort.\"\nHowever, deriving the \"recipe\" was anything but simple and required in-depth analysis.

   "text": "Light is composed of electric and magnetic fields that oscillate perpendicular to each other. When these oscillations are restricted, say, along a plane, it results in polarized light. Polarized light is of great importance in optical communications, and can similarly revolutionize how information is stored.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent electronic devices store information in the form of electronic charge. However, spin\u2014a uniquely quantum property of electrons\u2014offers an alternative. The spin can be controlled using polarized light to store information. A polarized light beam interacts with electron spins within a semiconductor to generate spin-polarized electrons, i.e., spins aligned along a specific direction. So far, only uniformly polarized light, i.e., light with a spatially uniform polarization, has been exploited to control electron spins. However, if the polarization has an additional spatial structure (variation), it can produce spatially structured electron spins, opening up new ways to store information.\nTo this end, a group of researchers, led by Junior Associate Professor Jun Ishihara from and including graduate student Takachika Mori, graduate student (at the time of the research) Takuya Suzuki, and Professor Kensuke Miyajima from Tokyo University of Science (TUS), Japan, has now devised a method for generating such spatially structured electron spins using a structured light with spatially varying polarization profile. The study, published in the journal Physical Review Letters, was done in collaboration with research groups from Chiba University, Tohoku University, and Tsukuba University in Japan.\n\"In this work, we generated a doughnut-shaped structured light\u2014a vector optical vortex beam with an orbital angular momentum (OAM)\u2014from a basic Gaussian beam using vortex half-wave plate and quarter-wave plate devices. We then used this beam to excite the electron spins confined within a gallium arsenide/aluminum gallium arsenide semiconductor quantum well. These spins, in turn, formed a helical spatial structure in a circle,\" explains Dr. Ishihara.\nInterestingly, while the beam with an OAM number equal to one produced a helix with two spin periods\u2014spin up and spin down\u2014around the circle, an OAM number of two resulted in a helix with four such alterations. These observations indicated that the spatial polarization structure of the optical vortex, determined by the OAM, was transferred to the electron spins inside the semiconductor. In addition, increasing the OAM number was suggested to enable higher information storage capacity, characterized by higher spin repetition rate around the circle.\nMoreover, the researchers utilized the effective magnetic field of the spin-orbit interaction acting on electron spins in the quantum well to simultaneously generate two spin waves with opposite phases in the vertical direction using a single beam. This suggested that various spin states with spatial structures could be produced by exploiting the effective magnetic fields (a characteristic of solids) alongside structured light beams.\nWith such exciting results, the researchers discuss the future prospects of their work. \"The conversion of the spatial polarization structure of light into a spatial structure of spin along with the generation of new spin spatial structures in combination with effective magnetic fields in solids are expected to lead to elemental technologies for higher-order quantum media conversion and information capacity enhancement using spin textures,\" says Dr. Ishihara.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJun Ishihara et al, Imprinting Spatial Helicity Structure of Vector Vortex Beam on Spin Texture in Semiconductors, Physical Review Letters (2023).

   "text": "Nickelates are a material class that has excited scientists because of its recently discovered superconducting ability, and now a new study led by Cornell has changed where scientists thought this ability might originate, providing a blueprint for how more functional versions might be engineered in the future.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperconductivity was predicted in nickel-based oxide compounds, or nickelates, more than 20 years ago, yet only realized experimentally for the first time in 2019, and only in samples that are grown as very thin, crystalline films\u2014less than 20 nanometers thick\u2014layered on a supporting substrate material.\nResearchers worldwide have been working to better understand the microscopic details and origins of superconductivity in nickelates in an effort to create samples that successfully superconduct in macroscopic \"bulk\" crystalline form, but have yet to be successful. This limitation led some researchers to speculate that superconductivity was not being hosted in the nickelate film, but rather at the atomic interface where the film and substrate meet.\nIn \"Resolving the Polar Interface of Infinite-Layer Nickelate Thin Films,\" published in Nature Materials, a research team led by Lena Kourkoutis, associate professor of applied and engineering physics, and Berit Goodge, Ph.D. '22, Minerva Group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Physics of Solids, used an advanced scanning transmission electron microscope and electron energy loss spectroscopy to provide an unprecedented look at the atomic interface between a nickelate film and its strontium titanate substrate.\nWhat they discovered was an intermediate compound formed at the interface\u2014one that had never been predicted and that alleviated the kind of electronic charge buildup that could give rise to superconductivity. The finding proved that the previously proposed model of a superconducting interface is not valid\u2014the superconductivity is instead occurring in the nickelate film itself.\n\"An important outcome of our work was establishing what the atomic and electronic structure of the interface actually looks like,\" Kourkoutis said. \"Previous work had assumed a structure that, as far as we can see, simply doesn't exist. We are now providing the true structure of that interface so that scientists can use that information to better understand these materials and engineer new variations in the future.\"\nThe discovery is encouraging for the field because it shows that superconductivity may not be reliant on the thin-film geometry. This means that creation of superconducting bulk crystals theoretically should be possible, according to Goodge.\n\"There are certain experiments to probe the fundamental physics of this system which can't be done until we have really high-quality bulk crystals,\" Goodge said. \"And so, while the thin films are an excellent platform, we do want to be able to expand out to larger crystals to do those other measurements. Now we know there's not some fundamental physical limitation why superconductivity occurs only in thin films.\"\nGoodge added that these efforts will support advancements across a broader range of superconducting families to develop new compounds for technological applications.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBerit Goodge, Resolving the polar interface of infinite-layer nickelate thin films, Nature Materials (2023).

The more ways there are of arranging things in a system, whether it be gas atoms in a box, people in a queue, parts in a mixture, or building blocks along a polymer chain, the higher the entropy is. The same applies to a unique class of alloys known as high-entropy alloys (HEAs). In a material like metal telluride, tellurium and metal ions are usually arranged in an ordered, crystalline pattern, in a low-entropy configuration. However, if the single type of metal is replaced with a blend of five different metals, there is a whole range of ways in which the metal sites can be filled. This leads to a high-entropy (or high entropy-of-mixing) state, with unique physical properties.\nA team led by Associate Professor Yoshikazu Mizuguchi of Tokyo Metropolitan University have been studying the superconductivity of high-entropy metal telluride. At high pressures, the critical temperature (Tc) below which superconductivity arises is known to decrease with higher pressure in more conventional materials. However, recent research found that metal telluride high-entropy alloys with a large number of metals had a particularly robust superconductivity at high pressure, with a Tc that didn't decrease much as the pressure was ramped up further.\n\n\n\n\n\n                    (a) Tc vs pressure. Alloys with more potential occupants for their metal sites, specifically the two high-entropy alloys (HEAs), have a Tc which stops changing with higher pressure. (b) Gradient in Tc vs. pressure. Alloys with a high entropy of mixing have a gradient value closer to zero, meaning that Tc hardly changes with changing pressure.

Credit: Tokyo Metropolitan University\n                 \n\n\nNow, the team has begun to figure out why by measuring and simulating the atomic structure, as well as what energies the electrons like to take (the band structure). It turns out that the disorder introduced by the range of metals that can sit in the metal sites has real implications for its properties. For example, the ways in which the atoms in the crystalline lattice can vibrate in a normal crystal are often confined to specific frequencies, like different modes of vibration on a guitar string.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nBut thanks to the disorder in how the metal sites are filled, a simulation of the density of states, a map of the frequencies at which the atomic structure likes to vibrate, showed an extremely broadened structure, and not a series of peaks. This is typical of glasses, solids with a disordered structure, but not of crystalline materials like metal telluride. A similar broadening was found in the band structure, where the energies of states in which electrons can lie were blurred out. This was also found to correlate with real, experimentally measured local structural disorder using X-ray diffraction techniques.\nInterestingly, it was found that this glassiness and blurriness only become prominent when the metal telluride structure had a high entropy. This also correlated with the critical temperature no longer dropping with pressure. The team believe there might be a unique coupling between the behavior of electrons in the material, the vibrational behavior of the atomic lattice, and the superconducting properties. They now have their sights set on experiments with single crystals of high-entropy telluride, continuing the search for exotic mechanisms that might explain how superconductivity works.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYoshikazu Mizuguchi et al, Glassy atomic vibrations and blurry electronic structures created by local structural disorders in high-entropy metal telluride superconductors, Materials Today Physics (2023).

   "text": "In the same way as the traditional optical interference technique, shearography obtains object deformation information by obtaining the phase, and the measured object is often dynamic in practical applications, so the spatial carrier method, which can extract the phase information from a single speckle pattern, becomes a necessary phase extraction method for the practicalization of shearography. However, due to the coupling relationship between shearing amount and spatial carrier frequency, the spatial carrier method often suffers from spectrum overlapping, which seriously affects the quality of the extracted phase.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently, Prof. Yonghong Wang and his team from Hefei University of Technology, published a research paper in Light: Advanced Manufacturing, entitled \"A robust phase extraction method for overcoming spectrum overlapping in shearography.\"\nThe paper reviews the causes of spectrum overlapping in spatial carrier shearography and proposes a phase extraction method based on an improved windowed Fourier ridge algorithm to achieve high quality phase extraction in spectrum overlapping. Simulations and practical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for various cases.\nIn many cases, spatial carrier shearography is inevitably subject to spectrum overlapping, such as large deformation detection or large aera detection. If the phase extraction method can extract a high quality phase in the case of spectrum overlapping, it will be beneficial to the practical application of shearography.\nThe windowed Fourier ridge (WFR) is a phase extraction method proposed by Prof. Qian KeMao of NTU mainly for phase extraction of project fringes. However, in shearography, the spectrum overlapping produced is the most serious due to the consistency of the spectrum size of background light, object light and conjugate object light, and it also puts forward higher requirements for the parameter setting of WFR algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n\n                Figure 2. (a) Unwrapped phase map of the method described in this paper, (b) unwrapped phase map of the nonlinear filter, and (c) unwrapped phase map of the binary mask filter. Credit: Yonghong Wang\n             \n\n\nSince modern optical systems widely use circular aperture diaphragms, the proposed method uses the Hough transform to analyze the speckle pattern spectrum, obtains the coordinates of the center point of the object spectrum and the radius of the spectrum, and roughly determines the frequency band of the window Fourier ridge through the correspondence between the frequency domain coordinates and the spatial coordinates of the camera sensors, which reduces the running time of the algorithm and allows searching the local frequency with a smaller step size.\nIn addition, for the regional characteristics of the object light spectrum when the spectrum is mixed, using a large window for WFR will lead to increased speckle size, and a small window will be mixed with zero-order information, so this paper proposes the use of a linearly transformed elliptical window for WFR, as shown in Figure 1, the elliptical window with the long axis parallel to the y-axis direction is used near the zero-frequency, and with the right shift of the frequency scan interval linearly changes to an elliptical window with the long axis parallel to the x-axis direction, thus maximizing the use of spectrum information and improving the quality of phase extraction.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers obtained the speckle patterns under different spectrum overlapping cases by simulation and experiment, and also compared two other phase extraction methods. Taking the measured object as a non-destructive testing standard as an example, Figure 2 shows the real phase of the phase map obtained by the three phase extraction methods after filtering and unwrapping.\nIt can be seen from Figure 2 that the unwrapped phase obtained by the proposed method is very smooth, while the other two methods have obvious fringe breaks causing the unwrapped phase anomaly, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tXiangwei Liu et al, A robust phase extraction method for overcoming spectrum overlapping in shearography, Light: Advanced Manufacturing (2023).

Their unique memory design, introduced in a paper in Physical Review Letters, has been found to be extremely robust, meaning that it could store information for long periods of time despite ongoing network activity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are building a network of quantum computers, which use trapped ions to store and process quantum information,\" Peter Drmota, one of the researchers who carried out the study, told Phys.org. \"To connect quantum processing devices, we use single photons emitted from a single atomic ion and utilize quantum entanglement between this ion and the photons.\"\nTrapped ions, charged atomic particles that are confined in space using electromagnetic fields, are a commonly used platform for realizing quantum computations. Photons (i.e., the particles of light), on the other hand, are generally used to transmit quantum information between distant nodes. Drmota and his colleagues have been exploring the possibility of combining trapped ions with photons, to create more powerful quantum technologies.\n\"Until now, we have implemented a reliable way of interfacing strontium ions and photons, and used this to generate high-quality remote entanglement between two distant network nodes,\" Drmota said. \"On the other hand, high-fidelity quantum logic and long-lasting memories have been developed for calcium ions. In this experiment, we combine these capabilities for the first time, and show that it is possible to create high-quality entanglement between a strontium ion and a photon and thereafter store this entanglement in a nearby calcium ion.\"\nIntegrating a quantum memory into a network node is a challenging task, as the criteria that need to be fulfilled for such a system to work are higher than those required for the creation of a standalone quantum processor. Most notably, the developed memory would need to be robust against concurrent network activity.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \n\n\n\n\n\n\"This means that the quantum information stored in the memory must not degrade while a network link is established,\" Drmota explained. \"This requires extreme isolation between the memory and the network, but at the same time, there also needs to be a fast and reliable mechanism that couples the memory to the network when needed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n                View inside the vacuum chamber, where we trap strontium and calcium ions using electric fields and lasers.

The limited crosstalk in this mixed-species architecture also allowed them to detect errors in real-time and to utilize what is known as in-sequence cooling. Mixed-species entangling gates provided the missing connection between the network and the memory.\n\"One of the technical error sources that we face with trapped-ion qubits is dephasing due to magnetic field noise,\" Drmota said. \"Nevertheless, calcium-43 features transitions that are insensitive to magnetic fields, eliminating this error, hence boosting their coherence time. While strontium-88 is perfectly suited for generating photons for networking, it is sensitive to magnetic field noise.\"\nAlthough strontium-88 is known to be sensitive to magnetic field noise, the researchers were able to preserve entanglement between their memory ion and a photon for a longer time, by transferring quantum information from the strontium to calcium in the system. Specifically, they could preserve this entanglement for over 10s, which is at least 1000 times longer than they observed between a bare strontium ion and a photon.\n\"Furthermore, the strontium ion can be reused to generate further entangled photons, and we show that this process does not affect the fidelity of entanglement between the memory and the previous photon, hence achieving robustness to network activity,\" Drmota said. \"Notably, we managed to integrate the complexity associated with multiple challenging techniques, which have been developed in isolation in different setups over many years, in a single experiment.\"\nIn initial tests, the quantum memory created by Drmota and his colleagues achieved very promising results, as it was found to be highly robust, preserving entanglement between a trapped ion and photon for at least 10s. The team's demonstration of this quantum memory could be an important milestone on the ongoing quest to realize distributed quantum information processing.\nUsing their design, individual quantum computational nodes can be loaded with a given number of processing qubits (i.e., calcium), while the network qubit (i.e., strontium) can then be used to create quantum links between distant modules. Ultimately, this promising quantum memory could pave the way towards the creation of scalable quantum computing systems, as using small modules that can process quantum information and interconnecting them with other modules circumvents the need for large and complex ion traps.\n\"The robust quantum memory could be used in quantum repeaters, for private (blind) quantum computation, and is key for new developments in quantum communications, metrology and time keeping,\" Drmota added. \"For example, for the nascent field of entangled atomic clocks, the long entanglement storage durations achieved in our experiments will lead to an order-of-magnitude improvement in the precision of frequency comparison between distant clocks.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tP.

   "text": "A team of nuclear physicists and engineers from Sun Yat-sen University and the China Academy of Engineering Physics, both in China, has developed a more accurate way to track the sources of illegally trafficked radioactive materials. In their paper published in the journal Physical Review Letters, the group describes their new method and its accuracy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs more countries develop the technology to build nuclear reactors for producing electricity, or as a propulsion source for ships or submarines, the threat of illegally trafficked radioactive materials rises. Such material poses a threat as a component in dirty bombs. As part of the effort to slow or stop such trafficking, scientists have been developing ways to trace the origin of such materials as a means of policing those who have access to such technology and are willing to sell it to terrorist organizations.\nCurrently, it is difficult to identify spent fuel that came from boiling water reactors (BWRs) versus pressurized water reactors (PWRs), which makes it nearly impossible to trace a sample back to its source. In this new effort, the team in China has developed a process that greatly improves the ability to discern the difference.\nTo trace the source of a sample of spent fuel, forensic physicists look for clues to help identify the time it was inside of a reactor, the extent of its enrichment and finally, the reactor type. To measure and identify reactor type, the researchers studied the characteristics of spent fuel held in databases containing information collected over the past half-century.\nThey then developed linear equations that related the quantities to one another. Next, they applied their equations to isotopes found in the databases, using their results to tweak their equations. They found they were able to use some of the measurements of the materials to calculate other characteristics and identify the sources of materials originating from six types of nuclear reactors.\nThe research team then trained a deep-learning AI network to find the differences between spent fuel from BWRs versus PWRs using their equations and tested it on another dataset. They found it to be 91% accurate in identifying BWR sources and 95% accurate in identifying PWR sources.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMore information:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShengli Chen et al, Linear Regression and Machine Learning for Nuclear Forensics of Spent Fuel from Six Types of Nuclear Reactors, Physical Review Applied (2023).
