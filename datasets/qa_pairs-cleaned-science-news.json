  "text": "For the past few years, American democracy has been perceived as backsliding. Politicians' refusal to accept election results despite a lack of evidence of fraud, the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and state-level restrictions on voting access and aggressive gerrymandering are all signs of democracy in crisis.          A new Northwestern University-led study, however, suggests that the full picture may not be as dire as it seems\u2014but highlights the importance of democratic norms and learning about other party's beliefs. Specifically, the research suggests that when state legislators learn that the views of voters from the other party are less extreme than they anticipated, they are less likely to endorse anti-democratic actions.The results were published today, May 30, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by a team of political scientists and sociologists from multiple universities. James Druckman, the Payson S. Wild Professor of Political Science at Northwestern, was a co-principal investigator on the study, which forms part of the larger Strengthening Democracy Project.The researchers' survey involved 534 state legislators from both parties, finding that the average legislator is actually less hostile toward the other party than the general public (64.2 vs. 71.3 on a zero to 100 scale where higher scores indicate more hostility), less supportive of undemocratic practices (11.2 vs. 26.4) and less supportive of partisan violence (3.8 vs. 10.9).Furthermore, while state legislators tended to have fairly accurate ideas about voters in their own parties' levels of hostility to the other party and support for undemocratic practices and partisan violence, they tended to overestimate the opposing party's voters' levels of support for these same things.\"Increasing partisan discord is definitely a challenge for democratic functioning; that should be worrisome,\" Druckman said. \"But I don't necessarily think that we are on an unavoidable path to the complete erosion of democracy. It's still possible that things could stabilize.\"A subgroup of surveyed legislators who received accurate information about the opposing party's voters' actual (more moderate) views after reporting what they thought those views might be subsequently changed some of their own views.Once this group of legislators learned that voters from the opposing party supported undemocratic practices less than they had anticipated, they self-reported lower support for these practices. This was true for both Democrats and Republicans.      State legislators perform key functions from drawing voting districts to holding power over the way elections are conducted, so their role in maintaining American democracy is fundamental.Overall, the results emphasize that misperceptions of members of the other party as having more animus and being more undemocratic than they actually are can create a vicious cycle that degrades democracy by potentially escalating the appetite for undemocratic activity that keeps the other party from power, the authors wrote.Conversely, more accurate bipartisan information can lead to less undemocratic attitudes and, potentially, actions among legislators.Druckman noted that the study had a few limitations. Though legislators from virtually all state legislatures and both major parties were invited to participate\u2014and the sample was appropriately balanced in size between Democrats and Republicans, male and female respondents, and states with and without term limits\u2014it's difficult to say whether the legislators who chose to participate may have been somewhat more pro-democracy, or less extreme, than their caucuses as a whole.For example, it's possible that some far-right legislators with extreme anti-democratic views may have declined to participate, since some evidence suggests that those partisans have lower trust and willingness to participate in political surveys.Additionally, there are some states\u2014including closely divided ones like North Carolina and Wisconsin\u2014where democratic norms have eroded, gerrymandering is extreme and other severely anti-democratic actions have already taken place. The study doesn't look granularly at the state level to see whether hyper-partisanship in these places might be \"moving the goalposts\" of what is perceived as acceptable there or nationally, Druckman said.Nevertheless, given that the legislators who received accurate information about the average opposing-party voters' views changed some of their views to be less anti-democratic upon finding that they were overestimating the threat to their power posed by the other party, the study still emphasizes that norms and dialogue are key to maintaining a functioning democracy.Druckman speculated that state legislatures that are full-time, in which no one party has a supermajority (meaning it can ignore the will of the minority party and perhaps even the governor), might better facilitate cross-partisan dialogue and professionalism, which can lead to contact and esteem between people in government.Ultimately, individuals can make a difference just by working together proactively at a baseline level, Druckman said, to promote democratic norms.\"In Utah, the two candidates for governor in 2020 came together and did an ad where they said that they would mutually respect the outcome of the election, regardless of what it was. So, they sent a pretty strong bipartisan message about respecting democracy,\" he said. \"That's a very positive approach.\" More information:James N.

  "text": "Stone Age humans may have made extended maritime voyages on the Caspian Sea, according to a new study published in the journal Open Archaeology.          The research analyzed ornamental beads made from the disk-shaped shells of a species of cockle (Didacna sp.) found at the Kaylu rock shelter, a cave-like burial site near the eastern shoreline of the Caspian Sea.Kaylu was used by Stone Age people over an extended period in the late Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. The transition between these periods is particularly significant in human cultural evolution as it parallels the transition between hunter-gathering cultures and herding and farming cultures, which occurred around 11,500 years ago in the region. Although Kaylu was excavated in the mid-twentieth century, its deposits were poorly described, and it wasn't comprehensively reassessed or directly dated until its rediscovery in 2018.For this study, lead author Solange Rigaud of the CNRSand University of Bordeaux, France and colleagues used a wide range of tools and techniques to determine how the beads were made and used. Microscopic, morphometric, spectrometric and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses showed a distinct stylistic change between the beads worn by the last hunter-gatherers and the first farmers.

DOI: 10.1515/opar-2022-0289             The analyses also enabled the researchers to compare the beads found at Kaylu with others from various sites across the region. Neolithic beads found in the northern, eastern and western Caspian Sea differed significantly enough from those found in the southern region to indicate that they followed a different route of cultural diffusion.It is well-established that the southern Caspian Sea area played a major role in the spread of farming technologies and practices, with the movement of farmers and herders along a route through what is now northern Iran. Rigaud's results suggest that cultural traditions also spread around the northern coastline of the Caspian Sea, independently of the inland route.However, another more exciting explanation is that Stone Age people engaged in maritime voyaging on the Caspian Sea. \"Seafaring contacts between these communities may have granted the rapid circulation of specific bead-types\u2014along with people, information, knowledge and symbols\u2014from either side of the Caspian Sea by long maritime voyages,\" Rigaud said.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the project that Heggeness has launched?",
  "answer_squad": " The Care Board",
  "text": "Any parent can tell you that work doesn't stop when you leave the office and go home. Yet national and international economic statistics only consider the work that happens \"at the market,\" or outside the home\u2014not caring for children, cooking, cleaning or caring for elders, tasks largely handled by women, in calculating economic statistics like gross domestic product.          A new study from the University of Kansas argues for including such work, or \"girly economics,\" for a full understanding of work happening in the country to produce better labor statistics and equitable public policy.Misty Heggeness saw firsthand how data often overlooked work in the home during her time with the U.S. Census Bureau. Now an associate professor of public affairs & administration and associate research scientist with KU's Institute for Policy & Social Research, she has written a study about how care work at home has been traditionally overlooked, how it leads to incomplete economic statistics and how such numbers are necessary for good public policy.Heggeness presented the paper, titled \"The Girly Economics of Care Work: Implications for Economic Statistics,\" at the American Economic Association annual meeting in January, and it was published in the AEA Papers and Proceedings.\"Women are and have always been economic agents. If we were to collect information about economic activity in a broader sense, what we would find is women are more active than men,\" Heggeness said. \"The total amount of paid and unpaid economic activity show for people working full-time jobs, women engage in about one additional hour of economic activity per day.\"The study is linked to a project Heggeness has launched. The Care Board is an effort to gather existing data and statistics on the care economy and make them available in one online location with a dashboard to help researchers, policymakers and others find useful information. The project will generate new statistics on such economic data as well.Heggeness cites an Institute for Women's Policy Research study that found among working adults, women average one extra hour per day on unpaid household chores and care work than men. And while an hour per day may not seem significant, over the course of a year, that adds up to 249 additional hours, or 31 days of additional work by women.      The consequences of excluding such data have been in place for decades. Heggeness points out that in 1953, the United Nations standardized a system of measurements to determine gross domestic product. One of the most widely used economic statistics in the world, GDP does not include work done inside the home.The United States does, however, collect data on care work outside the home. Such data shows that roughly 14% of the U.S. labor force is engaged in teaching, janitorial and cleaning services, and child care. That represents 23.4 million people, more than the state of Florida. But with unpaid care work in the home, such as caring for children or other family members, confusion can reign during times of economic crisis.During the COVID-19 pandemic, the additional stress on parents was widely reported. In addition to their full-time jobs, parents had to ensure kids could take part in online learning from home and saw other domestic tasks increase dramatically as well. The concern was that the additional stress would drive many parents, especially mothers, to leave the labor force.But a lack of reliable statistics on unpaid care work left both journalists and economists scrambling to determine just how much additional work was done and carried implications that women's work in the formal sector of the economy was less important than men's, Heggeness said.\"There are components about global and national history, whether intentional or not, that have been driven historically by men and that are determined by a monetized wage or price,\" Heggeness said. \"If we limit ourselves to that, we are blinding ourselves to the realities women contribute to the economy and keeping it going.\"After pointing out how unpaid care activities\u2014what she calls the underbelly of the economy\u2014are not included in official statistics, Heggeness wrote about the urgency of including such data, as the economy would not function without it.As a result, researchers, statisticians and economists cannot accurately track economic phenomena like a pandemic, growth or recessions without including all economic activity in primary measures. Similarly, it is difficult to measure how overworked or stressed care workers might be, and policymakers cannot develop effective policy to address such problems without a full slate of information, she wrote.\"To not generate statistics with depth and nuance now is an egregious flaw in the profession. We owe it to society and the generations that come after us to use the rich depth of cumulating administrative and real-time data on our economic lives both within and outside of our homes to generate a more complete picture of the modern caregiver and more accurately estimate their economic contributions to society,\" Heggeness wrote.\"With urgency, we must update national accounting systems and leading economic statistics to capture the modern realities of work, care and the economy and incorporate these statistics into mainstream views of our economy.\" More information:Misty L.

  "question_squad": " What did the researchers use to conduct the study?",
  "answer_squad": " Lucid and Mechanical Turk platforms",
  "text": "In October 2020, two rival candidates for office in Utah made an unusual television ad together. Incumbent Republican Gov. Spencer Cox and his Democratic challenger, Chris Peterson, appeared in the same spot to note they were both \"dedicated to the American values of liberty, democracy, and justice for all people,\" as Cox said, and that \"our common values transcend our political differences,\" as Peterson put it.          Such reassurances are unusual, however, and can be overwhelmed by other messages. Indeed, a new study co-authored by an MIT scholar finds that U.S. citizens likely overestimate how much their political opponents seek to undermine democracy\u2014a finding presenting both bad news and good news.One ominous implication of the research is that by believing their political opponents wish to curtail democracy, some partisans will then justify the erosion of democratic norms by their own side.\"This can result in a death spiral for democracy,\" says Alex \"Sandy\" Pentland, an MIT professor and co-author of a new paper detailing the results, which are based on surveys and experiments involving thousands of Americans.As the paper notes, false claims about the 2020 election by former president Donald Trump and others, as well as false news reports about purported election malfeasance, have made such beliefs common among Republicans; at the same time, Democratic Party leaders publicly emphasize that many Republican-backed measures imperil democracy.Yet the more positive implication of the findings is that partisans on both sides largely avow that they support democracy, to a greater degree than their rivals think, and seem receptive to hearing that their political opponents do as well\u2014perhaps through approaches like the joint Utah ad.Pentland adds: \"We find that making people aware of how much voters on each side support democracy has the effect of rather dramatically lowering the temperature on toxic polarization, and even changing which candidates people say they will vote for. Knowing that opposing groups also support democracy may be a core requirement for maintaining a strong democracy.\" For this reason, he notes, \"There is also hope in these findings, and that is that by reducing fear between partisans, we can strengthen democratic institutions.\"The paper, \"Why voters who value democracy participate in democratic backsliding,\" appears in Nature Human Behavior. The authors are Alia Braley, a doctoral candidate in political science at the University of California at Berkeley; Gabriel Lenz, a professor of political science at UC Berkeley; Dhaval Adjodah '11, SM '13, Ph.D. '19, a fellow at the philanthropic research initiative Schmidt Futures and a former research scientist at MIT; Hossein Rahnama, an associate professor at Toronto Metropolitan University and a former visiting professor at the MIT Media Lab; and Pentland, professor of media arts and sciences and the Toshiba Professor at the Media Lab.      To conduct the study, the researchers conducted an online survey and then a pair of experiments, using the Lucid and Mechanical Turk platforms. The survey asked a representative sample of 1,973 U.S. citizens to estimate their political opponents' willingness to subvert democratic norms, and to state their own willingness to do so, when presented with seven types of nondemocratic actions, such as limiting polling stations, banning rallies, and more.Overall, the results were similar between members of the two main U.S. parties; Democrats estimated that Republicans would be willing to subvert 5.0 democratic norms on average, while being willing to subvert 1.5 themselves; Republicans estimated Democrats would be willing to subvert 5.2 democratic norms on average, while being willing to subvert 1.2 themselves.Individuals who estimated their opponents were relatively more ready to stop democratic practices were, themselves, more willing to abandon those norms. The scholars believe this tendency is exacerbated by the debunked claims of leaders like Trump.In general, people \"have overlooked the significance of would-be authoritarians' frequent claims that their opponents are breaking democratic rules,\" Lenz says, alluding to similar claims by leaders such as former president Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. He adds: \"It causes their supporters, in this case Republicans, to tolerate the erosion of democratic norms by politicians like Trump. Instead of perceiving Trump as undermining democracy, they view him as leveling a playing field they believe has already been heavily tilted against them.\"However, the research also shows that people are receptive to valid information showing that their opponents are intent on upholding democratic practices. In an experiment involving 2,545 U.S. citizens, the researchers queried respondents about their perceptions of norm-breaking, then divided them into treatment and control groups, and gave the first group feedback about how their perceptions aligned with the facts.On a scale from 0 to 1, using the same seven cases from the initial survey, participants who had received fact-based feedback only rated their political opponents' willingness to subvert democratic norms at 0.40, whereas those given no factual feedback rated their opponents' intent to subvert democratic norms at 0.64. People in the treatment group were less willing to break democratic norms themselves, and, in hypothetical election scenarios, were less willing to vote for candidates who support the subversion of norms.In still another online experiment, this time again involving 1,973 U.S. citizens, the researchers then changed the format of the previous experiment to reduce the chances that respondents could anticipate follow-up questions. The results were broadly similar, although, in an additional observation, the scholars found that both Republican and Democratic participants reporting higher levels of ethnic antagonism were more likely to support subverting democratic norms.Overall, the results of the two follow-on experiments suggest that better information about political opponents helps raise confidence and trust levels; when Democrats see that many Republicans value democracy, and when Republicans see that many Democrats value democracy, there is at least an opening for people to avoid the downward spiral the U.S. may be facing.\"This work has important implications in a time when many people are looking for solutions to toxic polarization,\" Braley says. \"People will become more willing to uphold democracy when they are less afraid of the other side.\"She adds: \"One possibility when facing a politician like Trump is to launch a counter-narrative aimed at Republicans, showing that Democrats actually will uphold democracy. According to our research, this should make Republicans more willing to hold their representatives accountable.\"Exactly how to do that at a large scale is unclear. While the ad by the Utah candidates in 2020 was probably effective, it can be hard to reach large numbers of citizens. The researchers\u2014like their colleagues elsewhere in the U.S.\u2014say they will have to continue studying which approaches seem to help bolster bipartisan support for democracy.\"Our next step is to take these findings and test the best mechanisms for reducing these mutual fears between partisans in real-world contexts,\" Braley says.

  "answer_race": " Register office weddings are popular with older couples.",
  "question_squad": " What was the average age of the bride in the register office sample?",
  "answer_squad": " 6.7 percent",
  "text": "Register office weddings were more popular with older couples rather than runaway teenagers when introduced by the Victorians, new analysis shows.          More than a million couples chose to avoid a church for their wedding in favor of a register office following the Marriage Act 1836 until the death of Queen Victoria.Some couples chose to marry in a register office because they had something to hide. Others did so because of practical considerations of location, cost, and speed.Professor Rebecca Probert, from the University of Exeter Law School, analyzed information about 286 register office weddings celebrated between 1837 and 1901, with examples from 40 counties and 151 different registration districts.Older couples were overrepresented, and many of these were remarriages having first had a ceremony in a church. Brides and grooms marrying in the register office were twice as likely to be in their 40s and older.In 2020 Professor Probert put out a call via the Lost Cousins network of family historians and societies interested in family history inviting family historians whose ancestors had married in 'a civil ceremony' to provide information. A total of 184 got in touch and between them provided information about 1,132 weddings celebrated between 1837 and 2017.According to the national figures, in 1901 4.9 percent of marriages were recorded as involving a groom in their 40s, and 3.5 percent as involving one aged 50 or over. For brides, the percentages were even lower, with 3.6 percent of marriages recorded as involving a bride in her 40s, and just 1.6 percent involving one aged 50 or over. Within the sample exampled by Professor Probert 9.8 percent of grooms were recorded as being in their 40s, and 7.3 percent as over 50; similarly, 6.6 percent of brides were recorded as being in their 40s and 3.7 percent as over 50.During the Victorian era 16.7 percent of all marriages were stated to be remarriages for one or both of the parties. By contrast, 25 percent of the register office sample were stated to be widow(ers) or (more rarely) divorce(e)s.Professor Probert also found impediments for 24 marriages, or 8.4 percent. Three men married a daughter or niece of their deceased wife, while one woman married her deceased husband's brother, and seven men married their deceased wife's sister. The other 13 cases involved an existing spouse.In other cases individuals seem to have given false details. Within the sample, 6.2 percent of grooms and 8.9 percent of brides are known to have adjusted their ages (sometimes upwards, sometimes downwards). There were also 15 marriages in the sample (around 5.2 percent of the sample) in which there was an age gap of 20 years or more between the bride and groom. In one case where the bride was 33 years older than the groom, her given age was recorded as 50 rather than the actual 62, while he claimed to be 30 rather than 29.Within the register office sample, at least 14.7 percent of brides were pregnant, many of whom would have been very visibly pregnant at the time of the wedding.Increasing urbanization may also have played a role in the increase in register office weddings, for those who were living far away from their family or who did not have a deep connection with their new parish church.Professor Probert said, \"There's no simple answer to the question of who married in a register office in Victorian England. Individuals often made different choices at different stages in their lives. Working with family historians is a great way of building up a picture of what happened in practice.\"The study is published in the journal Family & Community History.

  "text": "Child sex abuse is one of the most heinous criminal offenses, so when a victim becomes an offender, it's evidence of a system failure.          When a 'victim-offender' is sentenced in court, a University of South Australia researcher is recommending judges acknowledge the offender's early trauma, in conjunction with the consequences for the crime, in their sentencing comments.The call for this to become best practice, follows new research that demonstrates multiple instances where judges implicitly or explicitly assumed knowledge that a victim-offender 'should have known better.\"UniSA researcher Dr. Bronwyn Arnold says it is important that judges recognize the unresolved trauma of child sex abuse.\"In this study I looked at the end point of the cycle\u2014when a child sex offender is sentenced by a judge for their crimes.\"\"The study found that, in several cases, judges assumed that the perpetrator should have been aware of the pain they were causing to their victims. But when the offender was also a victim of child sex abuse is this really appropriate?\"\"Psychological research shows that victims of sexual abuse may experience cognitive distortions in relation to abuse, including normalization and positive associations of their sexual abuse experiences. What this means is that they are less likely to be able to empathize with their victims, or 'know better.'\"\"The fallout from child sexual abuse is lifelong, with victims suffering serious long-term physical and psychological harms.\"\"So, while I am not downplaying the offense at all, I am saying that victim-offenders do not have a choice over the development of cognitive distortions which may facilitate offending behavior.\"In Australia, about 1.4 million adults were victims of child sexual abuse, with the first instance of abuse occurring between the ages of 6-8 years old.Victims of child sex abuse are almost five times more likely than the general population to be charged with any offense than their non-abused counterparts, with strongest associations found for sexual and violent offenses.The study recommends avoiding the use of statements that impute knowledge of victims' harm onto the offenders in the future.\"The assumption that offenders should know that they were causing harm has intuitive appeal. Yet these assumptions do not necessarily reflect their lived experience,\" Dr. Arnold says.\"For judges to acknowledge the unresolved trauma of victim-offenders, they're taking one step towards healing that damage.\"\"If the acknowledgment of an offender's harm could reduce their risk of reoffending, it should be done help stop the cycle of abuse once the offender is (eventually) released into the community.\"The findings are published in the journal Current Issues in Criminal Justice.

  "question_squad": " What did the authors of the study use to help students plan their study methods better?",
  "answer_squad": " artificial intelligence",
  "text": "According to a study by the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC), the Eurecat technology center and the Autonomous University of Madrid, published in PLOS ONE, students worked more continuously during the pandemic, which led to an improvement in their results.          The data analysis conducted over five academic years shows that continuous study, i.e. study beginning at least three months before examinations, is the best method for achieving good grades. This means that identifying how students are studying helps to predict their future performance.The authors of the study used artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the results well in advance, enabling them to help students who were potentially going to achieve poor results. As they were warned in advance, the students were able to review their preparation methods and change their learning strategies if they were not productive. It also enabled the teaching staff to identify bad practices both during learning and, later, in examinations, since it detected both copying and cases of plagiarism.\"UNESCO declared the importance of AI in education in 2019,\" said the lead researcher, Laia Subirats, a course instructor with the UOC's Faculty of Computer Science, Multimedia and Telecommunications, and a research advisor in the ADaS Lab group at the UOC's eHealth Center and a researcher at Eurecat. \"In this study, we show that it can be used to prevent bad practices when studying and to identify unusual results that may be concealing misconduct, such as plagiarism.\"The study is based on an analysis of the exercises done by 396 students on the Applied Computer Science course on the bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering program at the Autonomous University of Madrid with the e-valUAM adaptive learning tool. This e-learning platform presents tests with questions that vary depending on whether the answers given are correct or not.Based on the results of these tests, the research showed that AI can be used to help students to plan their study methods better. \"AI can help continuous learning in various ways,\" Subirats explained. \"In addition to detecting poor study strategies and bad practices, it can also personalize the pace of learning, provide personalized feedback through smart tutors, and answer questions by means of educational chatbots.\"Three learning profilesIn the data analysis, the students were classified into three groups according to how they studied and the results they achieved: those who work continuously, those who leave it to the last minute, and those obtaining poor results in general. The continuous study group achieved the best results. As a result, the authors of the study argue that strategies to encourage this practice should be sought.During the lockdown, among other things, face-to-face classes were replaced and teachers assigned more activities to do at home, which encouraged students to work more continuously. The researchers point out that alternative mechanisms must now be sought to maintain the more consistent working method that was adopted during the months when the students were unable to leave their homes.According to Laia Subirats, there are various tools to help students to study continuously, such as providing educational resources, constant feedback, collaborative learning and gamification. \"Some examples that encourage continuous study are establishing study goals and routines, learning collaboratively by interacting with the teacher and peers, doing practicals or similar exercises, writing the information in the students' own words, studying out loud and applying mnemonic techniques,\" she explained.Getting students to use these strategies and helping them with tools such as AI is the aim put forward by this study to encourage more consistent work and, as a result, better performance.

  "text": "Osaka Metropolitan University scientists found that Japanese and Chinese, who are considered to have high-context cultures with a high degree of reliance on information shared by the speaker and listener, are code-switching from high-context cultures to low-context cultures when communicating with people from each other's country. Furthermore, the scientists found that the Japanese do not engage in much code-switching with Chinese students in Japan.          When people communicate, speakers and listeners use information shared by both the parties, which is referred to as context. It is believed that there are cultural differences in the degree of reliance on this context, with Westerners having a low-context culture, i.e., they speak more directly, and Easterners having a high-context culture, i.e., they are subtle and speak less directly.Although Chinese are assumed to be in a high-context culture, Yamashina (2018) found that Chinese people are viewed as more direct speakers i.e., low-context cultural communicators by Japanese. A research team led by Professor Hiroshi Yama, from the Graduate School of Literature and Human Sciences, Osaka Metropolitan University, interpreted the results as that Chinese who know Japanese people try to be less context-dependent when communicating in Japanese.This is called \"code-switching.\" Generally, a low-context situation tends to arise when people engage in intercultural communication and interaction. The team found that Japanese and Chinese, who are considered to have high-context cultures, are code-switching from high-context cultures to low-context cultures when communicating with people from each other's country. Furthermore, it was found that the Japanese do not engage in much code-switching with Chinese students in Japan.This study provides empirical evidence that low-context cultural situations may arise when people engage in intercultural communication. This study also suggests that low-context cultures are more likely to be formed in environments with substantial intercultural interaction.\"The results of this research can be developed as a socioecological explanatory theory of how cultural differences between low-/high-context emerge,\" explained Professor Yama. \"The findings also provide hints for improving efficiency in actual communication situations. In the future, we will continue to examine the relationship between people's ability to adapt to life, contextual dependence, and code-switching ability.\"Their findings were published in Global Networks.

  "text": "Researchers at the Eberhard Karls University of T\u00fcbingen and colleagues in Germany have taken a closer look at the birch tar used to affix Neanderthal tools and found a much more complex technique for creating the adhesive than previously considered.          In their paper, \"Production method of the K\u00f6nigsaue birch tar documents cumulative culture in Neanderthals,\" published in Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences, the team compared different methods of creating birch tar to the chemical residues found on ancient Neanderthal tools.One of the attributes of human intelligence is the ability to synthesize substances and materials not found in nature. Tools use was once part of this consideration, but since several animals have been discovered altering and manipulating materials to be used as tools, it has become a less unique sign of intelligent behavior.Synthetic material manufacturing remains a significant aspect of our cognitive advantage over other animals, as it requires sentient thinking, planning and comprehension of our actions to convert raw materials through a learned process.The T\u00fcbingen study illustrates that modern humans are not alone in this ability and were not the first to reach this mental milestone. The birch tar used by Neanderthals predates any known adaptation by modern humans by 100,000 years. The sticky material was used as an adhesive backing to connect stone to bone and wood in tools and weapons, with the added benefit of being water-resistant and resistant to organic decomposition.How Neanderthals made birch tar has been speculated to be either a manufactured process or a found substance scrapped from rocks after a fire. Through a comparative chemical analysis of two birch tar pieces from Germany and a large reference birch tar collection made with Stone Age techniques, the researchers found that Neanderthals did not simply find birch tar after a fire, nor did they use the simplest manufacturing method.Instead, researchers have discovered that the Neanderthals who made the German birch tar used the most efficient method with a stepwise oxygen-restricted distillation process of underground heating to extract the synthetic adhesive.According to the authors, \"This degree of complexity is unlikely to have been invented spontaneously.\" Suggesting that the technique would have started with simpler methods and been developed into the more complex process by experimentation.To test the process that led to the German birch tar, the researchers engaged in experimental archaeology by recreating five different techniques for extraction, two above-ground and three below ground. With the birch tar extracted, the team applied infrared spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and micro\u2011computed tomography to analyze and compare their tar-making techniques with the ancient birch tar artifacts.Oxygen availability at the time of extraction left a clear marker on the experimental tars, creating a signature that clearly separated above-ground from below-ground methods. The ancient artifacts matched the below-ground manufacturing process. Both ancient tar artifacts and the below-ground experiments showed some soil mineral interaction and were free from soot-related carbons, unlike the above-ground techniques.Underground transformative techniques are trickier to execute than above-ground techniques because some elements cannot be observed or corrected after the procedure begins requiring a more precise set-up procedure.The evidence for cognitively complex Neanderthals has only increased in recent years, as archaeological evidence reveals many of the technological firsts thought to be modern human inventions were already in use among Neanderthals. At this point, it may benefit anyone who prefers thinking of human intelligence as an exceptional uniqueness to concede that Neanderthals were humans too.According to the authors, \"... Neanderthal birch tar making seems to be the first documented manifestation of this kind in human evolution.\" More information:Patrick Schmidt et al, Production method of the K\u00f6nigsaue birch tar documents cumulative culture in Neanderthals, Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences (2023).

  "text": "Researchers at the Francis Crick Institute have identified three 4,000-year-old British cases of Yersinia pestis, the bacteria causing the plague\u2014the oldest evidence of the plague in Britain to date, reported in a paper published in Nature Communications.          Working with the University of Oxford, the Levens Local History Group and the Wells and Mendip Museum identified two cases of Yersinia pestis in human remains found in a mass burial in Charterhouse Warren in Somerset and one in a ring cairn monument in Levens in Cumbria.They took small skeletal samples from 34 individuals across the two sites, screening for the presence of Yersinia pestis in teeth. This technique is performed in a specialist clean room facility where they drill into the tooth and extract dental pulp, which can trap DNA remnants of infectious diseases.They then analyzed the DNA and identified three cases of Yersinia pestis in two children estimated to be aged between 10 and 12 years old when they died, and one woman aged between 35 and 45. Radiocarbon dating was used to show it's likely the three people lived at roughly the same time.The plague has previously been identified in several individuals from Eurasia between 5,000 and 2,500 years before present (BP), a period spanning the Late Neolithic and Bronze Age (termed LNBA), but hadn't been seen before in Britain at this point in time. The wide geographic spread suggests that this strain of the plague may have been easily transmitted.                Map showing the distribution of LNBA Yersinia pestis strains. New genomes sequenced in this study are in purple. Credit: Pooja Swali et al. Nature Communications.             This strain of the plague\u2014the LNBA lineage\u2014was likely brought into Central and Western Europe around 4,800 BP by humans expanding into Eurasia, and now this research suggests that it extended to Britain.Using genome sequencing, the researchers showed that this strain of the Yersinia pestis looks very similar to the strain identified in Eurasia at the same time.The individuals identified all lacked the yapC and ymt genes, which are seen in later strains of plague, the latter of which is known to play an important role in plague transmission via fleas. This information has previously suggested that this strain of the plague was not transmitted via fleas, unlike later plague strains such as the one that caused the Black Death.Because pathogenic DNA\u2014DNA from bacteria, protozoa, or viruses which cause disease\u2014degrades very quickly in samples which might be incomplete or eroded, it's also possible that other individuals at these burial sites may have been infected with the same strain of plague.

Credit: Tony Audsley                 The Charterhouse Warren site is rare as it doesn't match other funeral sites from the time period\u2014the individuals buried there appear to have died from trauma. The researchers speculate that the mass burial wasn't due to an outbreak of plague but individuals may have been infected at the time they died.Pooja Swali, first author and Ph.D. student at the Crick, said, \"The ability to detect ancient pathogens from degraded samples, from thousands of years ago, is incredible. These genomes can inform us of the spread and evolutionary changes of pathogens in the past, and hopefully help us understand which genes may be important in the spread of infectious diseases. We see that this Yersinia pestis lineage, including genomes from this study, loses genes over time, a pattern that has emerged with later epidemics caused by the same pathogen.\"Pontus Skoglund, group leader of the Ancient Genomics Laboratory at the Crick, said, \"This research is a new piece of the puzzle in our understanding of the ancient genomic record of pathogens and humans, and how we co-evolved.\"                Charterhouse Warren - pit, taken in 1972. Credit: Tony Audsley             \"We understand the huge impact of many historical plague outbreaks, such as the Black Death, on human societies and health, but ancient DNA can document infectious disease much further into the past. Future research will do more to understand how our genomes responded to such diseases in the past, and the evolutionary arms race with the pathogens themselves, which can help us to understand the impact of diseases in the present or in the future.\" More information:Pooja Swali, Yersinia pestis genomes reveal plague in Britain 4000 years ago, Nature Communications (2023).

  "answer_squad": " Strengthening Democracy Project",
  "text": "For the past few years, American democracy has been perceived as backsliding. Politicians' refusal to accept election results despite a lack of evidence of fraud, the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and state-level restrictions on voting access and aggressive gerrymandering are all signs of democracy in crisis.          A new Northwestern University-led study, however, suggests that the full picture may not be as dire as it seems\u2014but highlights the importance of democratic norms and learning about other party's beliefs. Specifically, the research suggests that when state legislators learn that the views of voters from the other party are less extreme than they anticipated, they are less likely to endorse anti-democratic actions.The results were published today, May 30, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by a team of political scientists and sociologists from multiple universities. James Druckman, the Payson S. Wild Professor of Political Science at Northwestern, was a co-principal investigator on the study, which forms part of the larger Strengthening Democracy Project.The researchers' survey involved 534 state legislators from both parties, finding that the average legislator is actually less hostile toward the other party than the general public (64.2 vs. 71.3 on a zero to 100 scale where higher scores indicate more hostility), less supportive of undemocratic practices (11.2 vs. 26.4) and less supportive of partisan violence (3.8 vs. 10.9).Furthermore, while state legislators tended to have fairly accurate ideas about voters in their own parties' levels of hostility to the other party and support for undemocratic practices and partisan violence, they tended to overestimate the opposing party's voters' levels of support for these same things.\"Increasing partisan discord is definitely a challenge for democratic functioning; that should be worrisome,\" Druckman said. \"But I don't necessarily think that we are on an unavoidable path to the complete erosion of democracy. It's still possible that things could stabilize.\"A subgroup of surveyed legislators who received accurate information about the opposing party's voters' actual (more moderate) views after reporting what they thought those views might be subsequently changed some of their own views.Once this group of legislators learned that voters from the opposing party supported undemocratic practices less than they had anticipated, they self-reported lower support for these practices. This was true for both Democrats and Republicans.      State legislators perform key functions from drawing voting districts to holding power over the way elections are conducted, so their role in maintaining American democracy is fundamental.Overall, the results emphasize that misperceptions of members of the other party as having more animus and being more undemocratic than they actually are can create a vicious cycle that degrades democracy by potentially escalating the appetite for undemocratic activity that keeps the other party from power, the authors wrote.Conversely, more accurate bipartisan information can lead to less undemocratic attitudes and, potentially, actions among legislators.Druckman noted that the study had a few limitations. Though legislators from virtually all state legislatures and both major parties were invited to participate\u2014and the sample was appropriately balanced in size between Democrats and Republicans, male and female respondents, and states with and without term limits\u2014it's difficult to say whether the legislators who chose to participate may have been somewhat more pro-democracy, or less extreme, than their caucuses as a whole.For example, it's possible that some far-right legislators with extreme anti-democratic views may have declined to participate, since some evidence suggests that those partisans have lower trust and willingness to participate in political surveys.Additionally, there are some states\u2014including closely divided ones like North Carolina and Wisconsin\u2014where democratic norms have eroded, gerrymandering is extreme and other severely anti-democratic actions have already taken place. The study doesn't look granularly at the state level to see whether hyper-partisanship in these places might be \"moving the goalposts\" of what is perceived as acceptable there or nationally, Druckman said.Nevertheless, given that the legislators who received accurate information about the average opposing-party voters' views changed some of their views to be less anti-democratic upon finding that they were overestimating the threat to their power posed by the other party, the study still emphasizes that norms and dialogue are key to maintaining a functioning democracy.Druckman speculated that state legislatures that are full-time, in which no one party has a supermajority (meaning it can ignore the will of the minority party and perhaps even the governor), might better facilitate cross-partisan dialogue and professionalism, which can lead to contact and esteem between people in government.Ultimately, individuals can make a difference just by working together proactively at a baseline level, Druckman said, to promote democratic norms.\"In Utah, the two candidates for governor in 2020 came together and did an ad where they said that they would mutually respect the outcome of the election, regardless of what it was. So, they sent a pretty strong bipartisan message about respecting democracy,\" he said. \"That's a very positive approach.\" More information:James N.

  "text": "Stone Age humans may have made extended maritime voyages on the Caspian Sea, according to a new study published in the journal Open Archaeology.          The research analyzed ornamental beads made from the disk-shaped shells of a species of cockle (Didacna sp.) found at the Kaylu rock shelter, a cave-like burial site near the eastern shoreline of the Caspian Sea.Kaylu was used by Stone Age people over an extended period in the late Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. The transition between these periods is particularly significant in human cultural evolution as it parallels the transition between hunter-gathering cultures and herding and farming cultures, which occurred around 11,500 years ago in the region. Although Kaylu was excavated in the mid-twentieth century, its deposits were poorly described, and it wasn't comprehensively reassessed or directly dated until its rediscovery in 2018.For this study, lead author Solange Rigaud of the CNRSand University of Bordeaux, France and colleagues used a wide range of tools and techniques to determine how the beads were made and used. Microscopic, morphometric, spectrometric and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses showed a distinct stylistic change between the beads worn by the last hunter-gatherers and the first farmers.

DOI: 10.1515/opar-2022-0289             The analyses also enabled the researchers to compare the beads found at Kaylu with others from various sites across the region. Neolithic beads found in the northern, eastern and western Caspian Sea differed significantly enough from those found in the southern region to indicate that they followed a different route of cultural diffusion.It is well-established that the southern Caspian Sea area played a major role in the spread of farming technologies and practices, with the movement of farmers and herders along a route through what is now northern Iran. Rigaud's results suggest that cultural traditions also spread around the northern coastline of the Caspian Sea, independently of the inland route.However, another more exciting explanation is that Stone Age people engaged in maritime voyaging on the Caspian Sea. \"Seafaring contacts between these communities may have granted the rapid circulation of specific bead-types\u2014along with people, information, knowledge and symbols\u2014from either side of the Caspian Sea by long maritime voyages,\" Rigaud said.

  "text": "Any parent can tell you that work doesn't stop when you leave the office and go home. Yet national and international economic statistics only consider the work that happens \"at the market,\" or outside the home\u2014not caring for children, cooking, cleaning or caring for elders, tasks largely handled by women, in calculating economic statistics like gross domestic product.          A new study from the University of Kansas argues for including such work, or \"girly economics,\" for a full understanding of work happening in the country to produce better labor statistics and equitable public policy.Misty Heggeness saw firsthand how data often overlooked work in the home during her time with the U.S. Census Bureau. Now an associate professor of public affairs & administration and associate research scientist with KU's Institute for Policy & Social Research, she has written a study about how care work at home has been traditionally overlooked, how it leads to incomplete economic statistics and how such numbers are necessary for good public policy.Heggeness presented the paper, titled \"The Girly Economics of Care Work: Implications for Economic Statistics,\" at the American Economic Association annual meeting in January, and it was published in the AEA Papers and Proceedings.\"Women are and have always been economic agents. If we were to collect information about economic activity in a broader sense, what we would find is women are more active than men,\" Heggeness said. \"The total amount of paid and unpaid economic activity show for people working full-time jobs, women engage in about one additional hour of economic activity per day.\"The study is linked to a project Heggeness has launched. The Care Board is an effort to gather existing data and statistics on the care economy and make them available in one online location with a dashboard to help researchers, policymakers and others find useful information. The project will generate new statistics on such economic data as well.Heggeness cites an Institute for Women's Policy Research study that found among working adults, women average one extra hour per day on unpaid household chores and care work than men. And while an hour per day may not seem significant, over the course of a year, that adds up to 249 additional hours, or 31 days of additional work by women.      The consequences of excluding such data have been in place for decades. Heggeness points out that in 1953, the United Nations standardized a system of measurements to determine gross domestic product. One of the most widely used economic statistics in the world, GDP does not include work done inside the home.The United States does, however, collect data on care work outside the home. Such data shows that roughly 14% of the U.S. labor force is engaged in teaching, janitorial and cleaning services, and child care. That represents 23.4 million people, more than the state of Florida. But with unpaid care work in the home, such as caring for children or other family members, confusion can reign during times of economic crisis.During the COVID-19 pandemic, the additional stress on parents was widely reported. In addition to their full-time jobs, parents had to ensure kids could take part in online learning from home and saw other domestic tasks increase dramatically as well. The concern was that the additional stress would drive many parents, especially mothers, to leave the labor force.But a lack of reliable statistics on unpaid care work left both journalists and economists scrambling to determine just how much additional work was done and carried implications that women's work in the formal sector of the economy was less important than men's, Heggeness said.\"There are components about global and national history, whether intentional or not, that have been driven historically by men and that are determined by a monetized wage or price,\" Heggeness said. \"If we limit ourselves to that, we are blinding ourselves to the realities women contribute to the economy and keeping it going.\"After pointing out how unpaid care activities\u2014what she calls the underbelly of the economy\u2014are not included in official statistics, Heggeness wrote about the urgency of including such data, as the economy would not function without it.As a result, researchers, statisticians and economists cannot accurately track economic phenomena like a pandemic, growth or recessions without including all economic activity in primary measures. Similarly, it is difficult to measure how overworked or stressed care workers might be, and policymakers cannot develop effective policy to address such problems without a full slate of information, she wrote.\"To not generate statistics with depth and nuance now is an egregious flaw in the profession. We owe it to society and the generations that come after us to use the rich depth of cumulating administrative and real-time data on our economic lives both within and outside of our homes to generate a more complete picture of the modern caregiver and more accurately estimate their economic contributions to society,\" Heggeness wrote.\"With urgency, we must update national accounting systems and leading economic statistics to capture the modern realities of work, care and the economy and incorporate these statistics into mainstream views of our economy.\" More information:Misty L.

  "text": "In October 2020, two rival candidates for office in Utah made an unusual television ad together. Incumbent Republican Gov. Spencer Cox and his Democratic challenger, Chris Peterson, appeared in the same spot to note they were both \"dedicated to the American values of liberty, democracy, and justice for all people,\" as Cox said, and that \"our common values transcend our political differences,\" as Peterson put it.          Such reassurances are unusual, however, and can be overwhelmed by other messages. Indeed, a new study co-authored by an MIT scholar finds that U.S. citizens likely overestimate how much their political opponents seek to undermine democracy\u2014a finding presenting both bad news and good news.One ominous implication of the research is that by believing their political opponents wish to curtail democracy, some partisans will then justify the erosion of democratic norms by their own side.\"This can result in a death spiral for democracy,\" says Alex \"Sandy\" Pentland, an MIT professor and co-author of a new paper detailing the results, which are based on surveys and experiments involving thousands of Americans.As the paper notes, false claims about the 2020 election by former president Donald Trump and others, as well as false news reports about purported election malfeasance, have made such beliefs common among Republicans; at the same time, Democratic Party leaders publicly emphasize that many Republican-backed measures imperil democracy.Yet the more positive implication of the findings is that partisans on both sides largely avow that they support democracy, to a greater degree than their rivals think, and seem receptive to hearing that their political opponents do as well\u2014perhaps through approaches like the joint Utah ad.Pentland adds: \"We find that making people aware of how much voters on each side support democracy has the effect of rather dramatically lowering the temperature on toxic polarization, and even changing which candidates people say they will vote for. Knowing that opposing groups also support democracy may be a core requirement for maintaining a strong democracy.\" For this reason, he notes, \"There is also hope in these findings, and that is that by reducing fear between partisans, we can strengthen democratic institutions.\"The paper, \"Why voters who value democracy participate in democratic backsliding,\" appears in Nature Human Behavior. The authors are Alia Braley, a doctoral candidate in political science at the University of California at Berkeley; Gabriel Lenz, a professor of political science at UC Berkeley; Dhaval Adjodah '11, SM '13, Ph.D. '19, a fellow at the philanthropic research initiative Schmidt Futures and a former research scientist at MIT; Hossein Rahnama, an associate professor at Toronto Metropolitan University and a former visiting professor at the MIT Media Lab; and Pentland, professor of media arts and sciences and the Toshiba Professor at the Media Lab.      To conduct the study, the researchers conducted an online survey and then a pair of experiments, using the Lucid and Mechanical Turk platforms. The survey asked a representative sample of 1,973 U.S. citizens to estimate their political opponents' willingness to subvert democratic norms, and to state their own willingness to do so, when presented with seven types of nondemocratic actions, such as limiting polling stations, banning rallies, and more.Overall, the results were similar between members of the two main U.S. parties; Democrats estimated that Republicans would be willing to subvert 5.0 democratic norms on average, while being willing to subvert 1.5 themselves; Republicans estimated Democrats would be willing to subvert 5.2 democratic norms on average, while being willing to subvert 1.2 themselves.Individuals who estimated their opponents were relatively more ready to stop democratic practices were, themselves, more willing to abandon those norms. The scholars believe this tendency is exacerbated by the debunked claims of leaders like Trump.In general, people \"have overlooked the significance of would-be authoritarians' frequent claims that their opponents are breaking democratic rules,\" Lenz says, alluding to similar claims by leaders such as former president Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. He adds: \"It causes their supporters, in this case Republicans, to tolerate the erosion of democratic norms by politicians like Trump. Instead of perceiving Trump as undermining democracy, they view him as leveling a playing field they believe has already been heavily tilted against them.\"However, the research also shows that people are receptive to valid information showing that their opponents are intent on upholding democratic practices. In an experiment involving 2,545 U.S. citizens, the researchers queried respondents about their perceptions of norm-breaking, then divided them into treatment and control groups, and gave the first group feedback about how their perceptions aligned with the facts.On a scale from 0 to 1, using the same seven cases from the initial survey, participants who had received fact-based feedback only rated their political opponents' willingness to subvert democratic norms at 0.40, whereas those given no factual feedback rated their opponents' intent to subvert democratic norms at 0.64. People in the treatment group were less willing to break democratic norms themselves, and, in hypothetical election scenarios, were less willing to vote for candidates who support the subversion of norms.In still another online experiment, this time again involving 1,973 U.S. citizens, the researchers then changed the format of the previous experiment to reduce the chances that respondents could anticipate follow-up questions. The results were broadly similar, although, in an additional observation, the scholars found that both Republican and Democratic participants reporting higher levels of ethnic antagonism were more likely to support subverting democratic norms.Overall, the results of the two follow-on experiments suggest that better information about political opponents helps raise confidence and trust levels; when Democrats see that many Republicans value democracy, and when Republicans see that many Democrats value democracy, there is at least an opening for people to avoid the downward spiral the U.S. may be facing.\"This work has important implications in a time when many people are looking for solutions to toxic polarization,\" Braley says. \"People will become more willing to uphold democracy when they are less afraid of the other side.\"She adds: \"One possibility when facing a politician like Trump is to launch a counter-narrative aimed at Republicans, showing that Democrats actually will uphold democracy. According to our research, this should make Republicans more willing to hold their representatives accountable.\"Exactly how to do that at a large scale is unclear. While the ad by the Utah candidates in 2020 was probably effective, it can be hard to reach large numbers of citizens. The researchers\u2014like their colleagues elsewhere in the U.S.\u2014say they will have to continue studying which approaches seem to help bolster bipartisan support for democracy.\"Our next step is to take these findings and test the best mechanisms for reducing these mutual fears between partisans in real-world contexts,\" Braley says.

  "answer_squad": " 6.7 percent",
  "text": "Register office weddings were more popular with older couples rather than runaway teenagers when introduced by the Victorians, new analysis shows.          More than a million couples chose to avoid a church for their wedding in favor of a register office following the Marriage Act 1836 until the death of Queen Victoria.Some couples chose to marry in a register office because they had something to hide. Others did so because of practical considerations of location, cost, and speed.Professor Rebecca Probert, from the University of Exeter Law School, analyzed information about 286 register office weddings celebrated between 1837 and 1901, with examples from 40 counties and 151 different registration districts.Older couples were overrepresented, and many of these were remarriages having first had a ceremony in a church. Brides and grooms marrying in the register office were twice as likely to be in their 40s and older.In 2020 Professor Probert put out a call via the Lost Cousins network of family historians and societies interested in family history inviting family historians whose ancestors had married in 'a civil ceremony' to provide information. A total of 184 got in touch and between them provided information about 1,132 weddings celebrated between 1837 and 2017.According to the national figures, in 1901 4.9 percent of marriages were recorded as involving a groom in their 40s, and 3.5 percent as involving one aged 50 or over. For brides, the percentages were even lower, with 3.6 percent of marriages recorded as involving a bride in her 40s, and just 1.6 percent involving one aged 50 or over. Within the sample exampled by Professor Probert 9.8 percent of grooms were recorded as being in their 40s, and 7.3 percent as over 50; similarly, 6.6 percent of brides were recorded as being in their 40s and 3.7 percent as over 50.During the Victorian era 16.7 percent of all marriages were stated to be remarriages for one or both of the parties. By contrast, 25 percent of the register office sample were stated to be widow(ers) or (more rarely) divorce(e)s.Professor Probert also found impediments for 24 marriages, or 8.4 percent. Three men married a daughter or niece of their deceased wife, while one woman married her deceased husband's brother, and seven men married their deceased wife's sister. The other 13 cases involved an existing spouse.In other cases individuals seem to have given false details. Within the sample, 6.2 percent of grooms and 8.9 percent of brides are known to have adjusted their ages (sometimes upwards, sometimes downwards). There were also 15 marriages in the sample (around 5.2 percent of the sample) in which there was an age gap of 20 years or more between the bride and groom. In one case where the bride was 33 years older than the groom, her given age was recorded as 50 rather than the actual 62, while he claimed to be 30 rather than 29.Within the register office sample, at least 14.7 percent of brides were pregnant, many of whom would have been very visibly pregnant at the time of the wedding.Increasing urbanization may also have played a role in the increase in register office weddings, for those who were living far away from their family or who did not have a deep connection with their new parish church.Professor Probert said, \"There's no simple answer to the question of who married in a register office in Victorian England. Individuals often made different choices at different stages in their lives. Working with family historians is a great way of building up a picture of what happened in practice.\"The study is published in the journal Family & Community History.

  "text": "Child sex abuse is one of the most heinous criminal offenses, so when a victim becomes an offender, it's evidence of a system failure.          When a 'victim-offender' is sentenced in court, a University of South Australia researcher is recommending judges acknowledge the offender's early trauma, in conjunction with the consequences for the crime, in their sentencing comments.The call for this to become best practice, follows new research that demonstrates multiple instances where judges implicitly or explicitly assumed knowledge that a victim-offender 'should have known better.\"UniSA researcher Dr. Bronwyn Arnold says it is important that judges recognize the unresolved trauma of child sex abuse.\"In this study I looked at the end point of the cycle\u2014when a child sex offender is sentenced by a judge for their crimes.\"\"The study found that, in several cases, judges assumed that the perpetrator should have been aware of the pain they were causing to their victims. But when the offender was also a victim of child sex abuse is this really appropriate?\"\"Psychological research shows that victims of sexual abuse may experience cognitive distortions in relation to abuse, including normalization and positive associations of their sexual abuse experiences. What this means is that they are less likely to be able to empathize with their victims, or 'know better.'\"\"The fallout from child sexual abuse is lifelong, with victims suffering serious long-term physical and psychological harms.\"\"So, while I am not downplaying the offense at all, I am saying that victim-offenders do not have a choice over the development of cognitive distortions which may facilitate offending behavior.\"In Australia, about 1.4 million adults were victims of child sexual abuse, with the first instance of abuse occurring between the ages of 6-8 years old.Victims of child sex abuse are almost five times more likely than the general population to be charged with any offense than their non-abused counterparts, with strongest associations found for sexual and violent offenses.The study recommends avoiding the use of statements that impute knowledge of victims' harm onto the offenders in the future.\"The assumption that offenders should know that they were causing harm has intuitive appeal. Yet these assumptions do not necessarily reflect their lived experience,\" Dr. Arnold says.\"For judges to acknowledge the unresolved trauma of victim-offenders, they're taking one step towards healing that damage.\"\"If the acknowledgment of an offender's harm could reduce their risk of reoffending, it should be done help stop the cycle of abuse once the offender is (eventually) released into the community.\"The findings are published in the journal Current Issues in Criminal Justice.

  "text": "According to a study by the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC), the Eurecat technology center and the Autonomous University of Madrid, published in PLOS ONE, students worked more continuously during the pandemic, which led to an improvement in their results.          The data analysis conducted over five academic years shows that continuous study, i.e. study beginning at least three months before examinations, is the best method for achieving good grades. This means that identifying how students are studying helps to predict their future performance.The authors of the study used artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the results well in advance, enabling them to help students who were potentially going to achieve poor results. As they were warned in advance, the students were able to review their preparation methods and change their learning strategies if they were not productive. It also enabled the teaching staff to identify bad practices both during learning and, later, in examinations, since it detected both copying and cases of plagiarism.\"UNESCO declared the importance of AI in education in 2019,\" said the lead researcher, Laia Subirats, a course instructor with the UOC's Faculty of Computer Science, Multimedia and Telecommunications, and a research advisor in the ADaS Lab group at the UOC's eHealth Center and a researcher at Eurecat. \"In this study, we show that it can be used to prevent bad practices when studying and to identify unusual results that may be concealing misconduct, such as plagiarism.\"The study is based on an analysis of the exercises done by 396 students on the Applied Computer Science course on the bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering program at the Autonomous University of Madrid with the e-valUAM adaptive learning tool. This e-learning platform presents tests with questions that vary depending on whether the answers given are correct or not.Based on the results of these tests, the research showed that AI can be used to help students to plan their study methods better. \"AI can help continuous learning in various ways,\" Subirats explained. \"In addition to detecting poor study strategies and bad practices, it can also personalize the pace of learning, provide personalized feedback through smart tutors, and answer questions by means of educational chatbots.\"Three learning profilesIn the data analysis, the students were classified into three groups according to how they studied and the results they achieved: those who work continuously, those who leave it to the last minute, and those obtaining poor results in general. The continuous study group achieved the best results. As a result, the authors of the study argue that strategies to encourage this practice should be sought.During the lockdown, among other things, face-to-face classes were replaced and teachers assigned more activities to do at home, which encouraged students to work more continuously. The researchers point out that alternative mechanisms must now be sought to maintain the more consistent working method that was adopted during the months when the students were unable to leave their homes.According to Laia Subirats, there are various tools to help students to study continuously, such as providing educational resources, constant feedback, collaborative learning and gamification. \"Some examples that encourage continuous study are establishing study goals and routines, learning collaboratively by interacting with the teacher and peers, doing practicals or similar exercises, writing the information in the students' own words, studying out loud and applying mnemonic techniques,\" she explained.Getting students to use these strategies and helping them with tools such as AI is the aim put forward by this study to encourage more consistent work and, as a result, better performance.

  "text": "Osaka Metropolitan University scientists found that Japanese and Chinese, who are considered to have high-context cultures with a high degree of reliance on information shared by the speaker and listener, are code-switching from high-context cultures to low-context cultures when communicating with people from each other's country. Furthermore, the scientists found that the Japanese do not engage in much code-switching with Chinese students in Japan.          When people communicate, speakers and listeners use information shared by both the parties, which is referred to as context. It is believed that there are cultural differences in the degree of reliance on this context, with Westerners having a low-context culture, i.e., they speak more directly, and Easterners having a high-context culture, i.e., they are subtle and speak less directly.Although Chinese are assumed to be in a high-context culture, Yamashina (2018) found that Chinese people are viewed as more direct speakers i.e., low-context cultural communicators by Japanese. A research team led by Professor Hiroshi Yama, from the Graduate School of Literature and Human Sciences, Osaka Metropolitan University, interpreted the results as that Chinese who know Japanese people try to be less context-dependent when communicating in Japanese.This is called \"code-switching.\" Generally, a low-context situation tends to arise when people engage in intercultural communication and interaction. The team found that Japanese and Chinese, who are considered to have high-context cultures, are code-switching from high-context cultures to low-context cultures when communicating with people from each other's country. Furthermore, it was found that the Japanese do not engage in much code-switching with Chinese students in Japan.This study provides empirical evidence that low-context cultural situations may arise when people engage in intercultural communication. This study also suggests that low-context cultures are more likely to be formed in environments with substantial intercultural interaction.\"The results of this research can be developed as a socioecological explanatory theory of how cultural differences between low-/high-context emerge,\" explained Professor Yama. \"The findings also provide hints for improving efficiency in actual communication situations.

  "answer_squad": " Production method of the K\u00f6nigsaue birch tar documents cumulative culture in Neanderthals",
  "text": "Researchers at the Eberhard Karls University of T\u00fcbingen and colleagues in Germany have taken a closer look at the birch tar used to affix Neanderthal tools and found a much more complex technique for creating the adhesive than previously considered.          In their paper, \"Production method of the K\u00f6nigsaue birch tar documents cumulative culture in Neanderthals,\" published in Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences, the team compared different methods of creating birch tar to the chemical residues found on ancient Neanderthal tools.One of the attributes of human intelligence is the ability to synthesize substances and materials not found in nature. Tools use was once part of this consideration, but since several animals have been discovered altering and manipulating materials to be used as tools, it has become a less unique sign of intelligent behavior.Synthetic material manufacturing remains a significant aspect of our cognitive advantage over other animals, as it requires sentient thinking, planning and comprehension of our actions to convert raw materials through a learned process.The T\u00fcbingen study illustrates that modern humans are not alone in this ability and were not the first to reach this mental milestone. The birch tar used by Neanderthals predates any known adaptation by modern humans by 100,000 years. The sticky material was used as an adhesive backing to connect stone to bone and wood in tools and weapons, with the added benefit of being water-resistant and resistant to organic decomposition.How Neanderthals made birch tar has been speculated to be either a manufactured process or a found substance scrapped from rocks after a fire. Through a comparative chemical analysis of two birch tar pieces from Germany and a large reference birch tar collection made with Stone Age techniques, the researchers found that Neanderthals did not simply find birch tar after a fire, nor did they use the simplest manufacturing method.Instead, researchers have discovered that the Neanderthals who made the German birch tar used the most efficient method with a stepwise oxygen-restricted distillation process of underground heating to extract the synthetic adhesive.According to the authors, \"This degree of complexity is unlikely to have been invented spontaneously.\" Suggesting that the technique would have started with simpler methods and been developed into the more complex process by experimentation.To test the process that led to the German birch tar, the researchers engaged in experimental archaeology by recreating five different techniques for extraction, two above-ground and three below ground. With the birch tar extracted, the team applied infrared spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and micro\u2011computed tomography to analyze and compare their tar-making techniques with the ancient birch tar artifacts.Oxygen availability at the time of extraction left a clear marker on the experimental tars, creating a signature that clearly separated above-ground from below-ground methods. The ancient artifacts matched the below-ground manufacturing process. Both ancient tar artifacts and the below-ground experiments showed some soil mineral interaction and were free from soot-related carbons, unlike the above-ground techniques.Underground transformative techniques are trickier to execute than above-ground techniques because some elements cannot be observed or corrected after the procedure begins requiring a more precise set-up procedure.The evidence for cognitively complex Neanderthals has only increased in recent years, as archaeological evidence reveals many of the technological firsts thought to be modern human inventions were already in use among Neanderthals. At this point, it may benefit anyone who prefers thinking of human intelligence as an exceptional uniqueness to concede that Neanderthals were humans too.According to the authors, \"... Neanderthal birch tar making seems to be the first documented manifestation of this kind in human evolution.\" More information:Patrick Schmidt et al, Production method of the K\u00f6nigsaue birch tar documents cumulative culture in Neanderthals, Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences (2023).

  "text": "Researchers at the Francis Crick Institute have identified three 4,000-year-old British cases of Yersinia pestis, the bacteria causing the plague\u2014the oldest evidence of the plague in Britain to date, reported in a paper published in Nature Communications.          Working with the University of Oxford, the Levens Local History Group and the Wells and Mendip Museum identified two cases of Yersinia pestis in human remains found in a mass burial in Charterhouse Warren in Somerset and one in a ring cairn monument in Levens in Cumbria.They took small skeletal samples from 34 individuals across the two sites, screening for the presence of Yersinia pestis in teeth. This technique is performed in a specialist clean room facility where they drill into the tooth and extract dental pulp, which can trap DNA remnants of infectious diseases.They then analyzed the DNA and identified three cases of Yersinia pestis in two children estimated to be aged between 10 and 12 years old when they died, and one woman aged between 35 and 45. Radiocarbon dating was used to show it's likely the three people lived at roughly the same time.The plague has previously been identified in several individuals from Eurasia between 5,000 and 2,500 years before present (BP), a period spanning the Late Neolithic and Bronze Age (termed LNBA), but hadn't been seen before in Britain at this point in time. The wide geographic spread suggests that this strain of the plague may have been easily transmitted.                Map showing the distribution of LNBA Yersinia pestis strains. New genomes sequenced in this study are in purple. Credit: Pooja Swali et al. Nature Communications.             This strain of the plague\u2014the LNBA lineage\u2014was likely brought into Central and Western Europe around 4,800 BP by humans expanding into Eurasia, and now this research suggests that it extended to Britain.Using genome sequencing, the researchers showed that this strain of the Yersinia pestis looks very similar to the strain identified in Eurasia at the same time.The individuals identified all lacked the yapC and ymt genes, which are seen in later strains of plague, the latter of which is known to play an important role in plague transmission via fleas. This information has previously suggested that this strain of the plague was not transmitted via fleas, unlike later plague strains such as the one that caused the Black Death.Because pathogenic DNA\u2014DNA from bacteria, protozoa, or viruses which cause disease\u2014degrades very quickly in samples which might be incomplete or eroded, it's also possible that other individuals at these burial sites may have been infected with the same strain of plague.

The researchers speculate that the mass burial wasn't due to an outbreak of plague but individuals may have been infected at the time they died.Pooja Swali, first author and Ph.D. student at the Crick, said, \"The ability to detect ancient pathogens from degraded samples, from thousands of years ago, is incredible. These genomes can inform us of the spread and evolutionary changes of pathogens in the past, and hopefully help us understand which genes may be important in the spread of infectious diseases. We see that this Yersinia pestis lineage, including genomes from this study, loses genes over time, a pattern that has emerged with later epidemics caused by the same pathogen.\"Pontus Skoglund, group leader of the Ancient Genomics Laboratory at the Crick, said, \"This research is a new piece of the puzzle in our understanding of the ancient genomic record of pathogens and humans, and how we co-evolved.\"                Charterhouse Warren - pit, taken in 1972.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards hindsight bias?",

  "question_squad": " What did the researchers want to find out about the relationship?",
  "answer_squad": " if people would evaluate the couple and their relationship differently when they knew the couple had broken up",
  "text": "\"I knew they wouldn't last\" is the reaction people often have when hearing that a couple they know has broken up.          However, a new study, published in the open-access journal Social Psychological Bulletin, suggests that people might want to think twice before assuming they could have seen the break-up coming. Hindsight bias might just be playing tricks on their memory.Having conducted a series of surveys among over 1,000 college students and community adults in total, a research team from the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire concludes that it is only after someone learns about a couple's break-up that they perceive a break-up as more obvious.Furthermore, it is at this point that the observer is more likely to focus on the negative qualities of the relationship instead of the positive ones and evaluate the relationship more unfavorably, thereby justifying the \"logical\" outcome.To test the role of hindsight bias, the researchers ran two studies. In both studies, they gave each of the survey participants a story that described a seemingly happy and loving couple who had a number of good things going for them, such as a great emotional connection, but also a number of bad things, such as different religious beliefs.Then, in each study, the researchers split the respondents into three groups, and each of the groups was given different information about the couple's relationship status six months later.One group was given no information. One group was told that the couple broke up. And the third group was told a positive outcome: that the couple simply \"stayed together\" (in the first study) or \"got engaged\" (in the second study).The researchers wanted to find out if people would evaluate the couple and their relationship differently when they knew the couple had broken up as opposed to staying together.After the respondents were given the whole fictional scenario, they were asked about how they had thought the relationship would develop when they first read about the couple. They were also asked to rate the quality of the described relationship.As a result, the researchers report, there was not much of a difference in the responses between the groups that received either no information or a positive scenario.However, there was a stark contrast between those two groups and the group who were told the couple broke up. Those who were told the couple was no more rated a break-up as more obvious than the other groups did, and rated the couple's relationship more negatively.The researchers suggest that once a break-up has happened, \"signs of the impending break-up that were ignored or unnoticed in foresight may become more relevant, as they now supply ideas for how things could have been different.\"\"As individuals update their knowledge and use newly acquired outcome information to make sense of experiences, they may forget or reinterpret thoughts and predictions they previously had,\" the researchers write.\"Thus, memory might be reconstructed with more weight placed on the negative elements of the relationship. Likewise, aspects of the relationship might be reinterpreted to make sense of the outcome. After a break-up, for instance, what was previously interpreted as constant attention and affection may be reinterpreted as neediness of an overbearing partner. Similarly, differences in beliefs that were previously interpreted as opportunities for perspective-taking and negotiation may be reinterpreted as insurmountable barriers.\"In conclusion, the team points to their data as evidence that post-break-up self-blame and negative reactions from others\u2014which pose a risk for depression and anxiety\u2014might be unwarranted.\"We hope that future research will explore the psychological consequences of hindsight bias in romantic relationships, as well as the specific mechanisms that may operate to produce the bias.\" More information:April Bleske-Rechek et al, I \"knew\" they wouldn't last: Hindsight bias in judgments of a dating couple, Social Psychological Bulletin (2023).

  "text": "When it comes to how couples manage money, not everyone jumps to join their accounts.          New research from the University of Georgia looked at demographic and personal factors that revealed what makes couples more or less likely to pool finances.A survey of more than 600 married or cohabitating individuals found that moving in together was not enough of a reason to combine finances. While some traditional indicators of stability\u2014marriage, more dependents and higher net worth\u2014increased the likelihood of joint accounts, having two sources of income made couples more likely to split finances.\"I just always assumed, based on my family background, that couples always pool their money. If they were married, they just pooled assets and income and made joint decisions,\" said the study's co-author John Grable, an endowed professor in UGA's College of Family and Consumer Sciences. \"That's not always the case, and this study shows we can actually identify groups of people or profiles of individuals and couples where pooling resources is not as common.\"The study's authors believe these results can not only help other researchers and financial counselors gain insight into financial integration styles, but they could help couples understand their approach to joint finances.\"Our research does suggest that people have a really hard time talking about money,\" said co-author, Ph.D. graduate, UGA part-time lecturer and financial planner Michelle Kruger. \"So, if they're able to even establish whether they have the same kind of goals and values when it comes to spending money, that probably indicates a level of cohesiveness.\"Combining resources or keeping accounts separateThe study found that married participants were 4.5 times more likely to have pooled finances, which Grable said is expected.\"Pooling assets in a case where there's not a marital agreement can be really dangerous for the couple and the individual because the law doesn't provide the same protection for unmarried cohabitating couples as it would for a married couple,\" Grable said.The impact of net worth, on the other hand, was more surprising.Individuals identified their household's net worth as positive, zero or negative. Couples with a positive net worth, meaning their combined assets were higher than their combined debts, were more likely to merge finances. Those with a neutral net worth were less likely to combine, and negative net worth did not have a significant impact either way.\"To me, it was interesting that it wasn't driven primarily by income. It wasn't necessarily the level of debt that mattered, but the net worth,\" Grable said. \"And debt could include credit cards, student loans, auto loans, mortgages, those kinds of things.\"Researchers also found that a growing household could push couples toward joint accounts. With a one-person increase in household size, the likelihood of a combined account increased by about 20%.On the other hand, individuals with a bachelor's degree or higher level of education were slightly less likely to combine accounts. And couples with multiple income earners were about 50% less likely to pool finances. If both partners have income, they may choose to manage that income alone, researchers said. A non-working partner, however, could face challenges if they could not access any household income.\"If there's one income earner, and I make the income, do I feel entitled to make all the decisions on how the income is spent or saved? That can create a power dynamic problem in a relationship,\" Grable said. \"The pooling of assets helps alleviate some of that.\"      Conversation a key factor in financial decisions and relationship healthAside from demographics, agreeing on spending was also a top indicator of how couples manage their finances. Couples who had more open conversations about money and agreed with their approach were 105% more likely to combine their accounts.\"Agreeing on spending mattered a lot,\" Kruger said. \"That's a good thing. That's something we want couples to factor in when they are making decisions about how to manage their money, whether that's together or separate.\"This aligns with existing research, which shows that couples who pool resources tend to exhibit more stability in their marriage, Grable said.\"If a couple decides because they don't agree on spending to kind of keep things separate, that's a potential warning sign there might be stability issues or power structure issues within that couple,\" he said. \"It's not something to be alarmed about, or a predictor of divorce or separation, but it is something to consider.\"While this study provided insight into how couples might approach their finances, there is not a hard and fast rule for what financial integration style sets couples up for success. That has to come from communication and seeking out resources or help when issues arise, researchers said.And when they seek out guidance from a financial planner or counselor, a better understanding of these factors can help guide conversations and steps forward.\"There are so many different ways that couples do this. What's most important is that they find a system that works for them,\" Kruger said. \"But when there is trust and communication, couples can come to a place where they're both happy with how they're managing things.\" More information:Michelle Kruger et al, Factors Associated with Couples Pooling their Finances, Contemporary Family Therapy (2023).

  "text": "Ghana's informal urban markets play a key role in the country's economy. They employ more than 80% of the people who work in the informal sector. They create livelihoods for traders, give urban residents access to essential household products, and add value to the culture of urban life.          Most market traders rely on credit from financial institutions, family and friends. Few have insurance. Without insurance, traders are left vulnerable to fire disasters, as urban markets are prone to fire outbreaks.There are no statistics on the number of fires that have gutted markets in Ghana. That's because the numbers fall under the Ghana National Fire Service's classification of commercial fires. In 2022 there were 986 recorded commercial fires in Ghana.Urban market fires in the informal sector have received relatively little attention from local governments compared to flood disasters. And research shows that local government authorities have failed to include fire risk in their urban management and development plans.Our study showed that risk communication is an important part of fire disaster management. Providing adequate information on fire risks is crucial in disaster prevention and response. But effective fire risk communication requires that authorities engage regularly with communities. In this case, traders. It must do so in a way that draws on community knowledge and practices.Risk communication in informal urban marketsWe did our research in the Makola and Nima markets in Accra, Ghana's capital city. The Makola market is large, having more than 35,000 traders and hawkers. It was established in 1924 and has grown in an unregulated way. The Nima market is much smaller but has also grown haphazardly in a slum area.The selection of these two markets enabled us to compare and understand socio-cultural factors affecting fire risk communication.We combined interviews and focus group discussions with market women, executives of traders' unions, and officials of the Ghana National Fire Service, the National Disaster Management Organisation, and the Regional Coordinating Council.One of our key findings was that informal traders lose trust in the authorities when they fail to keep the promises made after previous fire disasters. This leads to traders' distrust of risk communication information and actions by authorities.In addition, fire risk communication by the authorities has been ineffective because of limited engagement between traders and city authorities. Traders told us that a continuous relationship with officials of the Accra Metropolitan Assembly would have helped reduce market fires.There was also the issue of language, which hampered effective fire risk communication. Some traders said that most radio discussions on fire risks and hazards were conducted in languages they did not understand. For instance, in the Nima market, which is dominated by traders from northern Ghana and neighboring west African countries, the traders mentioned that fire risk communication was delivered by traders' association executives mostly in English and other southern languages. Traders weren't proficient in these. Obviously, being unable to understand a particular language affects the ability to comprehend a message.Religious beliefs also contributed to the way traders perceived fire risk communication messages. Some traders attributed fire outbreaks to the wrath of God on some traders due to perceived corrupt trading activities or punishment for moral failures.      Top-down approach doesn't workOur research shows that top-down risk communication involving authorities has been ineffective in reducing disasters. Research shows that communication is most effective when it involves authorities and residents at risk or affected by disasters.This allows for the development of communication strategies that are embedded in the cultures and environments of the communities.Each community's culture contains strategies and practices for dealing with disasters. Tapping into this makes risk communication more effective and builds social resilience. It shapes a community's perception of risks.Our findings point to issues which city authorities and disaster management institutions should consider when planning communication on fire risks in informal urban markets.Firstly, they should incorporate traders' circumstances in all communication plans. They should also work within each market's existing social structures, including traders' associations. Trust is crucial\u2014so disaster management agencies must respond to the needs of traders and, most importantly, live up to their responsibilities and promises.To be effective, fire risk communication strategies must not only be supported by formal institutions such as government agencies but also be rooted in and sensitive to each market's socio-cultural dynamics and networks.

  "answer_squad": " Providing girls and their families with the resources and support",
  "text": "Rates of child marriage increase in communities displaced by conflict as well as communities affected by natural and environmental disasters.          The current crisis in Sudan is just one place where this could be an issue. The recent earthquakes in Turkey and Syria are also typical situations where we are likely to see young girls pushed into marrying before they are ready. At these times of extreme fragility, there are fewer protections for young women than would normally be the case.A report published in 2020, from the Institute of Development Studies, a research organization affiliated with the University of Sussex, shows that crises exacerbate and complicate existing causes of child marriage, such as poverty and gender inequality. There are also additional crisis-specific causes. These include food insecurity; the breakdown of legal mechanisms that protect girls, such as minimum age of marriage laws; and an absence of rights and protections, such as the right to work or a guaranteed minimum household income.Marriage can be considered a form of protection against sexual violence, which often increases in conflict. During times of crisis, stress, insecurity and instability increase, while protective family and community structures are weakened. This reduces the support that members of extended families can provide to each other. There are also examples of forced marriages. For instance, reports from Damascus in Syria suggest that families were forced to allow the marriage of girls to members of armed groups. During the civil war in Sri Lanka, some parents married their girls earlier in the hope of protecting them from being recruited into militias.Twelve of the 20 countries with the highest prevalence of child marriage experience the most extreme humanitarian crises. Child marriage is often considered as one of the few viable survival strategies for girls in these difficult moments. Child marriage may also be considered more socially acceptable during a crisis. In many societies, women are expected to marry and have children eventually, so marriage occurring earlier than planned is not ideal but is also not necessarily considered harmful or a problem. Global data from Unicef showing the decline of child marriage hides this increase in communities affected by crises.The marriage of a girl before she is 18 has life-long negative consequences, such as pregnancy-related health problems and low educational attainment. But finding effective solutions to prevent it during emergencies is difficult.      What can help?Several actions are recommended to prevent child marriage around the globe, including in these crisis and conflict zones. Keeping girls in education is considered important, as school girls are less likely to marry.Economic incentives can be provided to households when their daughters attend school rather than marry. In Bangladesh, the female secondary school assistance program has increased the age at which recipients marry by between 1.4 and 2.3 years. The payment of school fees and provision of uniforms and books is also common, and this has been effective in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Egypt and Bangladesh .Other strategies target community expectations that limit girls' aspirations to being a passive wife and mother only. Talking with community leaders is usually complemented by direct investment in girls. Girls are offered informal education or life skills training to enhance access to employment or enhance sexual and reproductive health knowledge, for example, often delivered by peers from their community.Finally, the creation and implementation of minimum age of marriage laws, and other complementing social policies, are also considered critical. While most actions are targeted at preventing child marriage, meeting the needs of married girls is also important.One problem we have, however, is that most of the research done to understand child marriage and identify ways to prevent it, has not been done with crisis-affected communities. We still do not know whether these actions work effectively for girls affected by crises.Recent research on preventing violence against refugee adolescent girls argues that our responses to child marriage need to be better adapted for humanitarian situations. Keeping girls in schools during a humanitarian crisis is harder, for example, as is building relationships with community leaders in fast-changing community contexts.Parents are also more reluctant to let their daughters access any training or events away from the family space because of worries about their security in dangerous and uncertain environments.While we wait for more evidence on whether action to prevent child marriage in troubled times is working, there is more that can be done. Development professionals such as social workers, educators and health practitioners can work more closely with humanitarian organizations, to share knowledge, resources and capacities.Development organizations, particularly those at local levels, have a deep understanding of the communities affected, their history, their needs and values. Meanwhile, the international humanitarian community, led by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, have expertise in providing short-term care to those affected by severe or sudden crisis.Crisis usually occurs in countries where social and economic development initiatives are already present. This provides opportunities for local knowledge and leadership to guide and shape fast-paced and complex humanitarian action.Closer work by these organizations and practitioners could help to prevent child marriage when communities are affected by crisis. Providing girls and their families with the resources and support to help negotiate the many challenges they face during times of crisis is the only way we can improve this situation.

  "question_squad": " What is the term for sexual violence?",
  "answer_squad": " use of verbal pressure or physical violence to engage in any sexual activity with someone who is unwilling or hasn't consented",
  "text": "In early May, a New York jury found Donald Trump liable for sexually abusing the writer E. Jean Carroll in 1996. The jury did not find him liable for allegedly raping her.          In the wake of this high-profile case, and the many others of the #MeToo movement, what should we be doing to prevent sexual violence and promote equitable sex? So far, consent is getting too much of the spotlight. Schools, universities and popular media are focusing heavily on consent in their efforts to curb high rates of sexual violence.Many advocates and educators have recently shifted their messaging from \"no means no\" to \"yes means yes\" and \"consent is sexy.\" This messaging promotes voluntary and affirmative agreement. That is, the idea that silence does not mean consent.Regardless, consent is much too low a standard for promoting ethical sex\u2014even if it may be the best available legal standard. And focusing on consent limits our ability to create better approaches to dealing with sexual violence.It's time to stop focusing on consentSexual violence is the use of verbal pressure or physical violence to engage in any sexual activity with someone who is unwilling or hasn't consented. It is most often committed by men against women and other marginalized groups and is supported by societal stereotypes about gender and sexuality.As part of my research over the past decade, I have interviewed women who were victimized and men who perpetrated sexual violence. I have also conducted focus groups with men about heterosexual sex and dating. My critique of consent is based on this and other research.Here are five reasons we should stop focusing on consent and start thinking about more ethical values and norms.(1) Consensual sex is not always wanted, pleasurable or free from coercion.People can consent to sex they don't want or enjoy. Women often agree to sex they don't want to avoid hurting a partner's feelings, to maintain a relationship or to be seen as a good partner.People can also obtain consent by pressuring or coercing someone. Men are more likely than women to use violence and coercion in order to obtain someone's consent, often after they've gently declined.Messaging about consent like \"no means no\" and \"yes means yes\" implies that it's okay to continue trying if one's partner hasn't clearly said \"yes\" or \"no.\"(2) Teaching people how to give and understand consent isn't going to prevent sexual violence because sexual violence isn't usually about misunderstanding.There's little to no evidence that education about consent reduces sexual violence. Most men already understand when women don't want to have sex, even without a firm \"no.\" And knowing how to ask for consent isn't going to stop those who choose to ignore refusals or use violence. In the context of men's sexual violence against women, consent doesn't change men's feelings of entitlement to sex and women's bodies.In the words of one woman I interviewed who was victimized:\"He didn't necessarily\u2026force himself upon me, but\u2026he knew that there wasn't really consent. Like I gave it, but not really fully.\"(3) Consent doesn't require meaningful, collaborative decision-making between partners.Consent boils down to one partner's agreement in response to another's request. It is insufficient for promoting deeper collaboration in deciding whether and how sex will take place. In the case of sex between women and men, this usually means that men's desires are prioritized. Consent is also something you do before sex, rather than an ongoing and embedded part of sex.(4) Consent doesn't disrupt the stereotypes that support sexual violence.For example, false stereotypes suggest men can't control their sex drives. Some men use these stereotypes to claim it's not right or fair for their partners to change their minds or stop sex once started or consented to.The expectation that sex should be natural and spontaneous can make it difficult for women to stop unwanted sex. It also means that many young people view consent as disruptive to this \"natural\" progression.(5) Consent can be used as an excuse for sexual violence.It allows perpetrators to justify sexual violence because they can claim the victim gave unclear responses. Popular consent messages like \"yes means yes\" and \"no means no\" are easily co-opted and provide a ready-made excuse.For example, men in two of my studies used the importance of consent to blame sexual violence on women for not clearly communicating their lack of consent. And because we often see communication as being up to women, these men didn't need to take any responsibility for asking or clarifying.One perpetrator I interviewed even referred specifically to a consent message heard on campus to simultaneously admit that he should have listened to his partner while blaming her:\"I also told her to maybe be a bit more direct when it comes to 'Yes' and 'No,' because she was providing answers that were a little cloudy. Which I know with all the consent stuff up on the walls here it's, you know, 'only yes means yes.'\"      If not consent, then what?Moving beyond the language of consent will open new possibilities for promoting truly equitable and ethical sex. At a minimum, we need to teach young people how to communicate more meaningfully about sex.We need to teach that empathy, mutual decision-making and ongoing communication are integral components of sex, rather than preconditions that only take place before sex. And we need to teach and expect boys and men to listen to women's desires and care about their well-being.Reducing sexual violence and promoting ethical sex is also going to require substantial cultural change. Prevention programs that, in part, challenge what it means to relate as women and men are some of the most effective at reducing sexual violence. Comprehensive sexual health education that teaches young people about these issues early in life is also essential.The idea of consent should have never had more than a supporting role in defining ethical sex. It's time to shift the spotlight. Provided byThe Conversation  This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

  "answer_squad": " to admit 500,000 new immigrants annually by 2025",
  "text": "In 2022, Canada's population grew by a million people. Nearly all this growth\u2014a whopping 96 percent\u2014came from immigration.That's one million new people who need housing, education, health care and employment. The last time Canada saw such a level of growth was 1957, during the post-war baby boom.It's no secret that Canada is a nation open to immigrants. Our active immigration and refugee process and welcoming attitude are baked into our national reputation. Multiculturalism is enshrined in federal policy and the cultural mosaic is touted as our model for integrating newcomers.It's also clear Canada depends on immigration to drive population and economic growth. Like many high-income countries, birth rates here are far below replacement levels as families are choosing to have fewer children.This, coupled with an aging population and a pandemic that closed borders and slowed migration, has created critical labor shortages nationwide.Matching jobs with skillsThe federal government's economic recovery strategy relies heavily on increasing immigration targets.The goal is to admit 500,000 new immigrants annually by 2025, more than 60 percent of whom will be economic applicants. An economic applicant is someone who's been selected for their occupational skills, experience and ability to contribute to Canada's economy.Canada's approach to labor migration sounds good in theory: select the most talented applicants and offer them one-way tickets to a welcoming country with bountiful jobs and endless opportunity.But there's one problem. Newly arrived immigrants typically struggle to find employment that matches their skills and qualifications. Research shows that many end up working in precarious jobs characterized by low wages, irregular hours and unstable contracts.Yet, if executed well, Canada's ambitious immigration plan could benefit smaller communities and local employers desperately seeking workers.In our recent study published in The Canadian Geographer, we showed that more immigrants are settling in small and mid-sized communities than in Canada's largest metropolitan areas of Toronto, Vancouver and Montr\u00e9al.How do smaller urban areas ensure the economic integration of newcomers? To answer this, we focused our research on the city of Guelph, Ont., that has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.      Driven by local industryInterviews with local service providers and employers in the city revealed that anyone who wants a job can get one. But as our research showed, the type and quality of jobs available were low-skilled and less desirable to the highly educated, highly skilled immigrants Canada typically admits annually.Employment in small and mid-sized cities is largely driven by local industry, which varies depending on the region. In Guelph, it's manufacturing; in Brandon, Man., it's wheat; in Prince George, B.C., it's forestry, and in Pictou County, N.S., it's mining.So, while there may be many jobs available, the sectors and locations of those jobs may not align with the skills, qualifications and work preferences of newcomers to Canada. One way to bridge this gap is through regional economic immigration programs such as the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP).The PNP allows provinces and territories to select a specific number of immigrants to meet their local labor market needs. In 2023, close to one-quarter of anticipated immigrants are allocated to the PNPs.Immigrants applying to the PNPs are awarded higher points for in-demand occupations and are nominated for permanent residence by the province or territory. As part of the program, immigrants must indicate they intend to work and reside in that province.The impact of the PNPs has been evaluated over time  and the outlook for participating immigrants is promising. The challenge for cities will be to retain newcomers once they arrive.Studies show that communities that have meaningful employment opportunities fare better at attracting immigrants.Supporting skilled newcomersThere is no disputing that our existing labor supply is being diminished by economic growth, aging populations and a low birth rate. In 1980, for every one retiree there were six workers. By 2036, there will be only three workers for every retiree.Canada's response has been to boost immigration levels significantly. For that to be effective, we need integration policies that support skilled newcomers and a well-funded settlement sector that can keep pace with the entry of newcomers across all cities\u2014large and small.We also need governments to invest in better infrastructure, including housing and improved health care capacity.Smaller urban communities can help by taking pressure off the most heavily populated regions. With better alignment between policy and reality, immigrant employment experiences can improve over time.

  "text": "China is an important economic player in Africa. In 2021 alone, China accounted for nearly US$5 billion in foreign direct investment in African countries. The rapidly increasing Chinese presence across Africa has become a contentious issue both for Beijing and African governments.          In particular, mega projects funded by China have resulted in public controversies about the relationship between external investments and public debt. China is Africa's biggest bilateral lender. In 2020, it held over US$73 billion of Africa's public debt and nearly US$9 billion of its private debt. Due to this, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has accused China of leaving countries \"trapped in debt\".Kenya has been no exception. China's involvement in the construction of Kenya's Standard Gauge Railway is a typical example of controversies brought by China-supported investments. These include issues of increasing socio-economic inequalities between different population groups advanced by large-scale investments, local labor mistreatment by Chinese managers, accusations of neo-colonialism, and the long-term sustainability of loans issued by the Exim Bank of China for projects.In 2022, with a total debt of US$6.83 billion, China was Kenya's biggest bilateral creditor. Out of this amount, US$5.3 billion was advanced by the Exim Bank of China to finance the Standard Gauge Railway.It is against this background that our study asked if Chinese actors indeed determined how mega-infrastructures are realized in African countries. We examined the specific ways in which Chinese state-owned enterprises are involved in the construction of Kenya's Standard Gauge Railway. We analyzed how infrastructure development was realized on the ground and how Chinese construction companies shaped the process.The study showed that the decisions of Chinese state-owned enterprises in Kenya do not necessarily present a grand Chinese strategy. Instead, they result from changing political and economic circumstances in China, and reflect both state and private Chinese interests.Acknowledging these dynamics is important because it demonstrates how narratives about China's involvement in mega-infrastructure development might overemphasize the power of the Chinese state. Simultaneously, this highlights that African governments have more power to influence their industrial development and the sustainability of large-scale projects than mainstream narratives acknowledge.      Flagship projectsAlongside other large projects, such as the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor, the Standard Gauge Railway is central to Kenya's national development program Vision 2030. This is supposed to industrialize the country and advance socio-economic development.But the sustainability of the railway project and its contribution to government debt has been widely debated. In 2022, according to the National Treasury, Kenya's debt stood at KSh9.15 trillion (US$74.1 billion), equivalent to 67% of the country's GDP. There are also concerns whether Chinese contracts protect national interests.We took a closer look at the project to see if these fears were well founded. Between May 2019 and September 2020, we conducted interviews during multiple visits to Chinese construction camps alongside the railway construction sites.We interviewed managers and employees in construction and operational departments of China Road and Bridge Corporation, the main railway project contractor. We interviewed informants from the public sector in Kenya, including from Kenya Railways Corporation and Kenya Ports Authority. We also spoke to local government workers, private sector representatives, lawyers and scholars.Our research is unique because we directly engaged with the Chinese actors that built Kenya's new railway. Their perspectives have been lacking in both public and academic debates. This is because public engagement of Chinese contractors is usually strictly guarded due to the state ownership of these enterprises.Our interviews revealed that in Kenya, China Road and Bridge Corporation constantly shifted its strategies. It also adapted to local circumstances in the country and across East Africa, rather than only imposing its strategic priorities. This compromised its own interests of economic productivity and its public image. Our finding runs counter to any grand visions of transformative infrastructure development, the lens through which Kenya's rail project has been interpreted.The trade-offsWe found that the Chinese entity had adopted a method called the \"Early Entry Scheme\" to resolve issues of delayed land compensation. This involved direct, case-by-case negotiated payments to landowners. As a result, owners vacated land for project construction before the land settlement was officially approved by the National Land Commission of Kenya. This is uncommon among international contractors. Land compensation for a national infrastructure project is usually a responsibility of national governments. But with the delayed national compensation process, the China Road and Bridge Corporation resorted to the Early Entry Scheme.In Kenya, this scheme was driven by various concerns. Cost-saving was one. The Chinese company had learnt from the first phase of the project that the late delivery of even a small parcel of land could raise the cost of the project if labor and equipment were idle.Another concern was political. For a flagship project funded by the Chinese government, on-time delivery was crucial to promote China's image as an efficient development partner.Another interesting aspect of the project was how the Chinese company became the main operator of the Standard Gauge Railway\u2014not just the construction contractor. According to our interviews, operating the railway would not benefit the company financially. But the stakes were too high to leave it to chance. Operational challenges that a new company could experience might have affected the public image of the project, as well as the corporation itself. Therefore, the company had to balance its short-term financial interests with long-term reputational concerns.So far, there hasn't been clear evidence of the Standard Gauge Railway contributing to Kenya's national economic development. The current investment in the railway between Mombasa and Naivasha (120km away from Nairobi) is not enough to boost the economy. This could only be realized if the railway connected global maritime trade to the hinterland of East Africa, to accelerate transport efficiency at a regional scale. But the Kenyan and Ugandan governments did not manage to agree on financing terms to extend the project.For this reason, in 2018, the Exim Bank discontinued funding for extending Kenya's railway line to Uganda. This shows that Beijing's strategies of infrastructure development are not set in stone but change, and can even be reversed, due to shifting circumstances in overseas regions.Still, there are clear winners. Though the long-term profitability of Kenya's Standard Gauge Railway remains in question, China Road and Bridge Corporation managed to enhance its global market position. In Kenya alone, despite the controversies that surround the new railway, the corporation was given new tenders to complete other key national projects, such as the Nairobi Expressway.As we show in our study, this is not necessarily an outcome of a grand strategy in Beijing. Instead, this is a result of dynamic and ever-changing efforts of Chinese companies that try to align multiple demands between their own economic interests and various political priorities in China and across Africa.This highlights that African countries are not passive recipients of Chinese-funded projects. They have an important role to play in counterbalancing Chinese actors to shape how these projects are realized on the ground.

  "text": "Eugenia Rho believes in the importance of first impressions, especially during vehicle stops.          An assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science, Rho is the lead author of a new research paper that illustrates how a law enforcement officer's first 45 words during a vehicle stop with a Black driver can often indicate how the stop will end.\"We found that there's a key difference in how officers talk to Black drivers during the first moments of stops that end in an arrest, handcuffing, or search versus those that don't end in such outcomes,\" said Rho, who leads the Society, AI, and Language (SAIL) research lab at Virginia Tech. \"Simply put, the officer starts off with a command rather than a reason in escalated stops.\"Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the peer-reviewed research also found that Black men could often predict a stop's outcome simply by listening to those same 45 words, which generally spanned less than 30 seconds.\"There's a clear linguistic signature to escalated vehicle stops. It was discerned by trained coders, computational language models, and perhaps most importantly, by Black male citizens,\" Rho said.Rho began this research as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University, working alongside Jennifer Eberdhardt, a professor of organizational behavior and psychology, and Dan Jurafsky, a professor of computer science and linguistics.The team, which also included researchers from the University of Michigan, analyzed audio recordings and transcripts from police-worn body cameras from 577 vehicle stops that occurred over the course of a month in a medium-sized, racially diverse city in the U.S. The data included stops that ended in arrest, handcuffing, or searches and those that did not, but did not include any stops in which force was used.One reason the team decided to focus on Black drivers was they were disproportionately represented in the data, according to Rho.\"We limited the study to Black drivers because less than 1% of the escalated stops included non-Black drivers in our sample,\" Rho said. \"We included both male and female drivers, but escalated stops were predominately male drivers.\"The data was used in two studies included in the paper, one focused on officer language used during a traffic stop's earliest moments and a second aimed at better understanding the perception of Black men when hearing those same words. A third section of the paper includes a case study that examines the first moment of the traffic stop involving George Floyd in May 2020.      Dissecting the dialogIn the first study, researchers used computational linguistics and hand annotation to analyze the transcripts by identifying dialog acts, such as greeting, commands, questions, reasons, and more.\"Dialog acts are like conversation road maps,\" Rho said. \"They show not only what the speaker is trying to do\u2014like ask a question or give an order\u2014but also how that piece of conversation fits into the larger discussion, helping to guide what might be said next.\"When analyzing the findings, controls were set in place to account for factors that could impact the language used, such as the reason the driver was pulled over, the area's crime rate, and more.\"During vehicle stops, officers might ask for ID, explain why the driver was pulled over, or give a ticket. We were interested in how the balance of these dialog acts might differ between escalated and non-escalated stops,\" Rho said.The study found that the stops ending in escalation were almost three times more likely to begin with the officer issuing a command to the driver and 2 1/2 times less likely to provide a reason for the stop.\"We found that stops that end escalated, often start escalated,\" Rho said.Evaluating the experienceDuring the second study, researchers played the audio from the traffic stops in the first study to a nationally representative sample of 188 Black male U.S. citizens ranging in age, region, education, and political ideology. Each participant was asked to listen to 10 stops at random\u2014five that ended in escalation and five that did not\u2014from the perspective of the driver and were then surveyed about their feelings and predictions for the stop's outcome.Black male participants appeared to use officer language as a guide to whether they believed the stop would end with the driver being handcuffed, searched, or arrested. They predicted that 84% of stops that involved an officer giving orders with no reasons would escalate. In addition, they worried about force being used in more than 80% of the stops that involved orders and no reasons as compared to only 47% of stops that involved reasons with no orders.A present pattern in other stops?Having found escalated vehicle stops carry a unique \"linguistic signature\"\u2014the officer gives an order without stating the reason for the stop\u2014the researchers wanted to see if the same signature was present in stops that involve force. As a case study, the team examined the initial moments between Floyd and the officer who first approached him during the highly publicized encounter on May 25, 2020.In less than 30 seconds of Floyd's interaction with the officer, the officer delivered 57 words across nine speech turns, made up only of physical orders. Floyd, in his 11 speech turns, extended apologies, sought reasons for the stop, declared innocence, expressed fear, and pleaded with the officer. Yet every dialog act from Floyd was met with a singular response from the officer: an order.Better practices, better relationsAt a time when vehicle stops ending in the use of force often gain national attention, Rho said the team felt it important to better understand police-citizen interactions during more common vehicle stops.\"The most common way for the average citizen to encounter law enforcement is through vehicle stops,\" Rho said. \"So we really wanted to better understand how we can improve communication between officers and citizens during those encounters.\"While both studies reveal valuable insights, Rho said she hopes the observation is not where the reach of this paper ends.\"We want this study to really start conversations around how we can inform training around de-escalation practices for law enforcement and potentially a better understanding of how to facilitate relations between Black communities and law enforcement as well,\" Rho said.

  "text": "It's no secret that legal documents are notoriously difficult to understand, causing headaches for anyone who has had to apply for a mortgage or review any other kind of contract. A new MIT study reveals that the lawyers who produce these documents don't like them very much either.          The researchers found that while lawyers can interpret and recall information from legal documents better than nonlawyers, it's still easier for them to understand the same documents when translated into \"plain English.\" Lawyers also rated plain English contracts as higher-quality overall, more likely to be signed by a client, and equally enforceable as those written in \"legalese.\"The findings suggest that while impenetrable styles of legal writing are well-entrenched, lawyers may be amenable to changing the way such documents are written.\"No matter how we asked the questions, the lawyers overwhelmingly always wanted plain English,\" says Edward Gibson, an MIT professor of brain and cognitive sciences and the senior author of the study. \"People blame lawyers, but I don't think it's their fault. They would like to change it, too.\"Eric Mart\u00ednez, an MIT graduate student and licensed attorney, is the lead author of the new study, which appears this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Frank Mollica, a former visiting researcher at MIT who is now a lecturer in computational cognitive science at the University of Edinburgh, is also an author of the paper.Parsing legal languageSince at least the 1970s, when President Richard Nixon declared that federal regulations should be written in \"layman's terms,\" efforts have been made to try to simplify legal documents. However, another study by Mart\u00ednez, Mollica, and Gibson, not yet published, suggests that legal language has changed very little since that time.The MIT team began studying the structure and comprehensibility of legal language several years ago, when Mart\u00ednez, who became interested in the topic as a student at Harvard Law School, joined Gibson's lab as a research assistant and then a Ph.D. student.In a study published last year, Gibson, Mart\u00ednez, and Mollica used a text analysis tool to compare legal documents to many other types of texts, including newspapers, movie scripts, and academic papers. Among the features identified as more common in legal documents, one stood out as making the texts harder to read: long definitions inserted in the middle of sentences.Linguists have previously shown that this type of structure, known as center-embedding, makes text much more difficult to understand. When the MIT team tested people on their ability to understand and recall the meaning of a legal text, their performance improved significantly when center-embedded structures were replaced with more straightforward sentences, with terms defined separately.\"For some reason, legal texts are filled with these center-embedded structures,\" Gibson says. \"In normal language production, it's not natural to either write like that or to speak like that.\"Those findings raised a question that Gibson and his colleagues set out to explore in their new study: Why do lawyers write documents with such an impenetrable style? To get at that question, the researchers decided to perform a similar study using lawyers as their test subjects.Before beginning the study, the researchers came up with five possible explanations for why lawyers produce this kind of legal text. The most likely possibility, Gibson believed, was one he calls \"the curse of knowledge.\" This means that lawyers are so skilled at writing and reading legal documents, they don't realize how difficult they are for everyone else.Other possible explanations included that lawyers simply copy and paste from existing templates; that they write in legalese to make themselves sound more \"lawyerly\" to their colleagues; that they wish to preserve a monopoly on legal services and justify their fees; or that legal information is so complex that it can only be conveyed in very prescribed ways.To explore these hypotheses, the researchers recruited a group of more than 100 lawyers, from a diverse range of law schools and law firms, and asked them to carry out the same comprehension tasks that they had nonlawyers perform in their 2022 study.They found that lawyers, not surprisingly, were much better at parsing and recalling information from legal documents. As shown in the 2022 study, nonlawyers could typically recall about 38 percent of what they read in a legal document, and their success rate went up to between 45 and 50 percent with plain English versions of those texts. When faced with legal documents, lawyers could remember about 45 percent of what they read, and that number jumped to more than 50 percent when they were asked to read the simplified versions of the documents.This suggests that legal language represents a stumbling block for lawyers as well as nonlawyers. The finding also refutes the curse of knowledge hypothesis, because if that hypothesis were correct, then lawyers would be equally good at recalling both styles of information.\"Lawyers are much better, it turns out, at reading these contracts either in plain English or in legalese and understanding them and answering questions about them. However, they have a much harder time with the legalese, just like regular people,\" Gibson says.\"Using plain language would be beneficial for everybody, given that legalese is harder for both lawyers and nonlawyers to understand,\" Mart\u00ednez adds.      Simpler is betterIn a second set of experiments, the researchers evaluated lawyers' attitudes toward legal documents and simplified versions of those documents. After recruiting another group of more than 100 lawyers, the researchers asked them to rate the documents on a variety of criteria, including enforceability, willingness to sign such a document, overall quality, and the likelihood that a client would agree to the terms. The lawyers were also asked if they would hire the person who wrote each of the documents.Surprisingly, the lawyers rated the plain English documents as being higher quality than the original documents, and more likely to be agreed to by themselves and their clients. They also rated them to be equally enforceable as the original legal documents, and said they would be more likely to hire the person who wrote the plain English version.These findings essentially ruled out all of explanations that the researchers had considered, except for the copy and paste hypothesis: the idea that lawyers are copying old contracts and editing them for each new use. One possible reason why that has become a common practice is that lawyers want to keep using contracts that have been previously demonstrated to be enforceable.Over time, these contracts may have become increasingly complex as lawyers amended them for specific situations by adding center-embedded clauses.\"Maybe an original contract was written for one set of people, and if you want it to be more restricted, you add a whole new definition of that restriction. You can add it within a sentence, and that ends up being center-embedded,\" Gibson says. \"That's our guess. We don't know the details of how, and that's what we're working on right now.\" More information:Mart\u00ednez, Eric, Even lawyers do not like legalese, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

  "text": "Generation X women experience age in seven different ways according to a new study by Nottingham Business School (NBS), part of Nottingham Trent University.          Defined as those born between 1965 and 1980, the research explored how GenX women perceive their age and whether they experience aging in a chronological sense.This was analyzed in relation to the implications for marketers, with GenX positioned as an important generational cohort due its close alignment with consumer culture and increased disposable spending power.Over a period of three weeks and using online diaries, 19 women with varying life circumstances (aged between 41 and 55) reflected and reported on day-to-day incidents of personal age-related significance.Analysis of more than 250 diary entries revealed seven intersecting, overlapping, and coinciding \"frames\" of aging that the researchers named Affective, Protest, Acceptance, Camouflage, Life-Stage, Inequities, and Inconsequence.These age frames range from considering age as just an attitude, to outright rejection of age as a culturally imposed label. Some diarists did accept their chronological age but others used beauty products and clothing to camouflage theirs.Looking after young children and/or aging parents strongly affected personal age perception as did the menopause, present or as a looming event. This generation also felt the weight of inequalities, unfairness, and bias that implied they were comparatively less valued\u2014either than men of all ages and/or women younger than they.Lastly, some diarists professed to regularly forgetting their chronological age, regarding this as irrelevant or unrelated to their personal identity.Sharon-Marie Gillooley, principal lecturer in Marketing at NBS and research lead, said, \"It's becoming increasingly difficult to pin down the age of a GenX woman. This generation feels that it does not need to conform to age and gender related roles/rules like their parents, and therefore they are all experiencing and dealing with aging in different ways\u2014some are 'happily old,' others are 'young at heart'; for some lives are full of possibility, whilst others feel family responsibilities weighing heavily on their shoulders.\"This research suggests that marketing to GenX women presents a particular challenge for companies, as traditional demographic age-informed targeting is unlikely to work\u2014particularly as the research also suggests these age frames \"may apply to all of these women all of the time; all of these women some of the time; some of these women all of the time; or some of these women some of the time.\"As a sizeable demographic group, with increasing disposable income, GenX women are an increasingly attractive market. While this is a cohort that marketers should consider, the evidence suggests a chronological model of age categorization is not appropriate for their understanding of Gen X females. Rather, they are distributed and dispersed across many groups\u2014a moving, rather than fixed and predictable target.The study, now published in the European Journal of Marketing, suggests generalizing, or stereotyping, GenX women using an age-related appeal poses a major risk for brands that are in danger of distancing, not reaching, their target market.

  "answer_squad": " prioritizing the mental health of their employees",
  "text": "Canadian employers are currently facing significant challenges in attracting and retaining talent in the workplace, putting the responsibility on employers to attract employees to their organizations.          One key way for employers to achieve this is by prioritizing the mental health of their employees. Workplaces are increasingly recognizing that productive employees actively seek out workplaces that prioritize mental well-being and offer flexible working conditions.This recognition is well-founded, as employees tend to be more productive when they are not burdened by mental health challenges.As a teacher of current and future leaders, my experience confirms that employees want workplaces that facilitate well-being. Many of my students have indicated that mental health support at work is a must-have.Mental health stigmaMental health is a pressing issue for many. In 2021, a quarter of Canadians reported having symptoms of a mental health disorder. Five million reported needing professional help, and over one-third said they were burned out. Forty percent of workers aged 18 to 24 indicated they were at a \"breaking point.\"Although many employers are starting to recognize the importance of mental health support in the workplace, stigma still persists, resulting in negative attitudes and discriminatory behaviors.Leaders play a crucial role in addressing mental health stigma by modeling risk and vulnerability. By using informal communication, like sharing stories about their personal struggles, leaders can support the mental health of their employees.There is growing evidence that shows stigma decreases when leaders disclose their own mental health and substance use problems. This reduction in stigma, in turn, encourages employees to share their own stories and seek out treatment.      Being mindful of languageLeaders need to be careful about how they go about addressing stigma. Even those with good intentions can unintentionally cause harm. For example, using the word resilience to discuss mental health can be problematic.Framing resilience as a necessary skill for battling mental illness overlooks the fact that some mental health conditions are disabilities that cannot be toughed out. Assuming that mental toughness is an inextricable part of addressing disability is a form of ableism.Any employee who is suffering from mental health issues that cannot be fixed by resilience may avoid telling their story or seeking support for fear of being seen as weak.It's important for leaders to be mindful of the language they use to foster mentally safe and supportive working environments.Workplace flexibilityEvidence-based research about the outcomes of mental health awareness and wellness programs is currently lacking. These programs are well-intended, and experts are optimistic that we will have a better idea of what really works once we have more data.In the meantime, there is something employers can do immediately to prioritize the mental health of their employees: allowing them to choose when and where they work.Flexibility has been proven to work well in many jobs over the past few years, including in larger organizations like 3M Canada and Desjardins Group, as well as small and medium employers like Auvik Networks and GSoft.Unfortunately, flexibility can sometimes lead to boardroom debates about how many days in the office employees should work. As a result, what was initially intended as flexibility can inadvertently lead to rigid remote work policies. Workplaces need to be aware of this.True flexibility, without the need for employees to justify themselves, can help mitigate mental health challenges. By allowing for downtime and encouraging employees to do activities unrelated to their work, stress and burnout can be minimized.Challenges can also be minimized by recognizing when employees are most energized and productive and adjusting work schedules accordingly. The success of a flexible workplace hinges on the ability of leaders to trust their employees and refrain from micromanaging them.A new way of thinkingAccording to a recent job insight survey, when employees are forced to choose between flexibility and stability, most will choose stability.But do we need to choose one over the other? Why can't we have both? As many know from the last few years, employees can be productive at different times and in different places when leaders provide the necessary resources and support to make flexibility possible.Leaders have the valuable opportunity to challenge the typical \"either/or\" way of thinking and instead using \"both/and\" thinking. A personal experience of mine exemplifies this.Once, during a teaching session, a sales executive recounted a story about an employee of hers who asked to work remotely due to mental health challenges. This leader turned down the request, insisting the sales team could not successfully sell remotely.A debate ensued among the other executives and a suggestion was put forth: Why not have the sales team try selling remotely and see how it goes?Either/or thinking stops new solutions from emerging. It misses how creative tension\u2014the gap between where a group is and where it wants to go\u2014can help us challenge conventional assumptions about work, like the belief that flexibility and stability are mutually exclusive.In light of the prevalence of mental health issues, and the importance of fostering inclusive workplaces, leaders who act as agents of change can help reshape conventional notions of leadership and build better workplaces.

  "text": "People will often sacrifice a better experience and opt for one that's less enjoyable if it means they can do it alongside a loved one\u2014whether that's a romantic partner, close friend or relative. That's the main finding of our research published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology in April 2023.          For example, when taking a flight, two friends might decide to sit in adjacent seats in coach rather than accept a free upgrade to nonadjacent seats in first class. Failing to choose togetherness can have consequences, as in the \"Seinfeld\" episode in which Elaine suffers the indignities of economy class, leading to rage against Jerry after he chooses to accept an upgrade.We conducted five studies in a variety of settings and featuring different social bonds, including friendships and romantic relationships. In one study, just over half of people chose two adjacent seats far from the stage over two nonadjacent seats closer to the stage when imagining they were attending a Cirque du Soleil performance with a close friend, compared with only about one-third who chose the adjacent seats when imagining attending with an acquaintance.In another study, we asked students whether they wanted to eat one chocolate with another person\u2014either a new friend or a stranger\u2014or two chocolates alone. Half the people chose the shared experience\u2014but only if the other person was a friend. Fewer people\u201438%\u2014opted for the shared experience if the other person was a stranger.One reason people prioritize physical proximity with close partners is because they want to create shared memories. Importantly, people believe that physical distance can disrupt the creation of shared memories, and so they forgo enjoyable experiences apart from their loved one.This also matters for companies seeking to improve customer experience, such as an airline offering free upgrades or shorter wait times. Our findings suggest that, for example, consumers traveling with a companion might not take advantage of services like TSA PreCheck, an airline VIP lounge or a free upgrade if it is available only for themselves. It also helps explain why consumers do not like when airlines split up families in their seat assignments.However, we also tested a few initiatives marketers can use to encourage people to choose a higher-quality experience that requires them to be apart from their companion. In another experiment, we described a train ride as either a fun part of an excursion or as a practical way to reach a final destination. More participants accepted a free upgrade\u2014even though it required sitting apart from their romantic partner\u2014when they perceived the train ride as utilitarian. That's because they cared less about creating shared memories during the experience.We still don't know how this preference affects relationship quality.For example, when can time apart from your partner actually strengthen the relationship? And how should couples split their time between lower-quality activities done together and higher-quality activities done alone? One option for separate activities, for example, might be when one partner's desired activity does not interest the other.Also, given that people believe physical proximity is a prerequisite for creating shared memories, how can partners who live in different places also cultivate shared memories? This question is especially important in light of how COVID-19 has enabled more people to work and study remotely.

The spaces were found in the sprawling necropolis of Saqqara, which is a part of Egypt's ancient capital of Memphis, a UNESCO World Heritage site.Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said the workshops had been used to mummify humans and sacred animals. They date back to the 30th Pharaonic Dynasty (380 BC to 343 BC) and Ptolemaic period (305 BC to 30 BC), he said.Inside the workshops, archaeologists found clay pots and other items apparently used in mummification, as well as ritual vessels, Waziri said.The tombs, meanwhile, were for a top official from the Old Kingdom of ancient Egypt, and a priest from the New Kingdom, according to Sabri Farag, head of the Saqqara archaeological site.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards using ChatGPT in the writing process?",
  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What percentage of students said using an AI chatbot was a time saver?",
  "answer_squad": " Ninety percent",
  "text": "ChatGPT has been a topic of great discussion in academia, particularly about how to prevent its unauthorized use in classes. However, students can benefit from understanding how to use generative artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool to save time and improve performance on writing assignments.          Craig Hurwitz, an Executive in Residence in the Pratt School of Engineering, asked the graduate students in his \"Emerging Trends in Financial Technology (Fintech)\" course to generate a first draft of an essay with ChatGPT's help. His working assumption was that when students enter the workforce they will have access to, and the ability to use, generative AI for productivity purposes. He wanted to experiment with ChatGPT in his course to give students a first-hand look at how to use generative AI.For the assignment, the class was instructed to read a case study and each student chose a Fintech approach to help solve a particular challenge mentioned in the case. Their written assignment was a 750-word Executive Summary convincing the instructor (playing the role of Venture Capitalist) why he should consider meeting to discuss a potential investment.The instructions called for each student to create a first draft using ChatGPT. After generating the draft, they imported the draft into Microsoft Word and turned on \"track changes.\" They edited the initial draft and submitted the final draft with \"track changes\" still turned on.This gave the professor the ability to see the draft generated by ChatGPT, the changes that were made to that draft, and the final product submitted by each student. The range of unedited final output ranged from about 20 percent to over 90 percent. Following the assignment, students completed a survey about their experiences on the assignment. This post summarizes the student reactions to using ChatGPT.AI as a work skillStudents viewed this assignment as important training since they expect that they will be using AI in the workplace. There were many comments about how this assignment was a learning opportunity on how to use an AI chatbot effectively and how this is going to be a valuable skill when they graduate and take on full-time roles in the workforce.As one student explained, \"I really enjoyed working on this assignment. I believe what you let us do is what will happen in real life. Completing this assignment is good practice for us to use AI to improve our work.\"One specific skill the students gained is how to write effective prompts in ChatGPT. Many students realized that developing an appropriate prompt is an iterative process and is the key to a successful experience. Almost all students embarked on this exercise with an attempt to use a single prompt to create the entire essay.However, most students found that the output was too general, and in most cases, too repetitive. The most common reaction to this was to submit to ChatGPT specific follow-up questions using descriptive, succinct text designed to create output for a particular paragraph, or more specifically, a bullet point.Several students commented on the importance of training ChatGPT to take on a particular role prior to the process of prompting it to generate any written output. \"I'd place more emphasis on training the AI to adopt a certain persona, instead of spending a lot of time trying to figure out the right prompt,\" one student commented in the post-assignment survey.      Writing efficiencyEvery student claimed that using an AI chatbot to help generate a first draft was helpful. Ninety percent of students said that using an AI chatbot was a time saver. One student remarked, \"For every minute you spend on ChatGPT you are saving ten minutes, but be sure to give the AI the precise information you want it to work with and the risk of mistakes is minimal.\"Twenty-one out of 36 students in the class who speak English as a second language felt another benefit. Every one of them indicated that they already had experience using ChatGPT before this assignment. A common refrain was that using an AI chatbot helped them write as if English were their native language. However, as one student cautioned, \"The grammar the AI used was perfect, but I found the language to be vague and unsophisticated.\" This comment points to students' general understanding of ChatGPT's limitations.Limitations While students found ChatGPT useful, there was significant commentary about limitations of this generation of the technology. Limitations generally fell into one of three categories: 1) incorrect sources, 2) outdated sources, and 3) the output only being as good as the prompt. \"I found that ChatGPT generated information that was correct, but with incorrect citation,\" one student noted.Over half of the class found that ChatGPT generated incorrect information and only two of 36 expressed confidence in the sources cited by ChatGPT. Students understood fact-checking is an essential part of using ChatGPT for writing, since source integrity is a big issue. In addition, since the students' assignment was to highlight emerging trends in Fintech, they could not rely on ChatGPT's older data (Sept 2021).Note that students used the GPT-3.5 model for this AI-assignment; that was before GPT-4.0 was released, when the ability to cite sources improved somewhat, but relying on the sources provided by GPT remains problematic.Many students commented that they enjoyed working on the assignment, but they are aware of the ethical considerations such as intellectual property, and appreciated that guardrails are necessary. Students understood using ChatGPT can only be one step in the writing process. \"The bot shouldn't be used as a final response, but merely as a way to understand a topic or brainstorm ideas. ChatGPT's ability to synthesize sources and condense information is great, but shouldn't replace our own filters and ability to do that same job ourselves.\"ConclusionGenerative AI capabilities are advancing quickly. It is a productivity tool that will likely gain vast acceptance and usage in the workforce. Training students how to use the technology appropriately and effectively is an important life skill. To those worried about whether the output generated by ChatGPT is the work of the tool or the student, there is no substitute for doing the basic research, having a clear understanding of what it is that you want to communicate, and knowing, in advance, the written structure you expect to receive from ChatGPT.From the perspective of a professor who spent most of his career in industry, it was rewarding to see how quickly students adapted to the technology and optimized it, and how this led to essays produced more efficiently, and in many cases, of higher quality than they might have otherwise achieved.

  "answer_race": " To introduce a research paper.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the Indonesian government's policy on biodiesel?",
  "answer_squad": " ISPO",
  "text": "Indonesia is the biggest palm oil producer in the world, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture crediting it with a nearly 60 percent share of global production. The versatility of palm oil\u2014it is used in cosmetics, food products, detergents\u2014is a key reason for its popularity, which translates to a global market worth some US$60 billion that is predicted to reach US$100 billion by 2030.          Increasingly, palm oil is also used to make biodiesel. While that might reduce the use of fossil fuels and therefore be viewed as being environmentally and sustainability friendly, the somewhat murky reputation of palm oil gives consumers pause despite it producing \"more oil per land area than any other equivalent vegetable oil crop\".\"There was a lot of conflict and excitement at the same time,\" says Ishani Mukherjee, Singapore Management University (SMU) Associate Professor of Public Policy. \"On the one hand, biodiesel could be championed as an alternate fuel and a move away from fossil fuels, but on the other hand the ecological issues associated with palm oil as a feedstock were something we could not ignore.\"She adds, \"What was revealed at that time were these massive regulatory gaps in how the sustainability of biodiesel was being governed. So, my research came along at that point. I looked at three main policies that were out there to check the sustainability of this product in Indonesia. I realized that there was a lot of leakage happening across the supply chain that was undermining the sustainability of the product.\"Professor Mukherjee's recent paper \"Fueling green connections: Networked policy instrument choices for sustainability regulation,\" which is based on her previous fieldwork, examined the environmental sustainability of Indonesia's biodiesel governance regime, and won the Review of Policy Research Best Article Prize for 2022. The three main policies that she looked at were:The Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) certification standard, otherwise known as Ministry of Agriculture Regulation No. 19/2011. ISPO is a re-establishment of existing multi-ministerial regulations into a dedicated package that streamlines national sustainability certification efforts;Ministry of Energy Regulation No. 32/2008, the national mandates on biodiesel use that requires a progressive blend of biodiesel and diesel to be supplied across the nation; andThe Basic Forestry Law (Law No. 41/1999) that established a classification system for national forests which is used to site oil palm plantations for biodiesel production.These three laws \"either have direct effects on sustainability as part of feedstock production upstream, indirectly impact the environment by involving the final commodity downstream or have sustainability 'spillovers' across sectors,\" Professor Mukherjee wrote in the paper.      Subsystems, interconnectedness, and cohesionShe then looked into the biofuel regulatory subsystem in Indonesia.\"A policy subsystem\u2026 is the main unit for policy scholars to study and draw the boundaries around any issue area,\" Professor Mukherjee explains, adding that \"the subsystem idea allows us to look at a policy issue and all the actors, institutions and ideas that occupy that space.\"\"For example, the biodiesel policy subsystem unites different ministries (agriculture, forestry, energy) with different non-governmental organizations (environmental and social), and different industries (palm oil and biofuel) and other actors, that the term 'ministry' or the word 'sector' or 'industry' would not fully capture.\"She then measured the 'interconnectedness' of the subsystem, using the UCINET software to pick out actors' common presence at meeting and conferences, which \"gave an idea of how frequently they were meeting and talking\" about the issues at hand. High interconnectedness may include routine meetings, information transfer, or contractual obligations, in this case relating to biodiesel policy.Professor Mukherjee also looked at the 'cohesion' between the actors by quantifying how much they agreed on the various issues. To achieve this, she went through proceedings, documented records and meeting minutes to find instances where attendants agreed (or disagreed) on various issues, and followed up with extensive interviews.The result of this network analysis: Indonesia's biofuel subsystem had high interconnectedness and low cohesion, which means the many parties met regularly but they often did not agree on what should be done to regulate it sustainably.\"Biodiesel as renewable energy and palm oil are contentious topics. They tend to polarize people\u2026 so that makes it easy to identify cohesion or the lack thereof,\" notes Professor Mukherjee. \"Sustainability needs to be achieved across the supply chain. That's what wisdom about sustainability policy tells us because there's no point in having piecemeal policy tools if there are so many leakages across the supply chain.\"\"I looked at the three main policies governing biodiesel sustainability, and I saw that they were actually governing sustainability at three different chunks of the supply chain. Those chunks reflected patchiness in the policy network. There were actors clumped together on the downstream of the supply chain.\"\"Another clump of actors appeared in the middle of the supply chain. Another clump appeared in the beginning, more upstream end. That was a very telling example: if we have these clumps appearing in a network, each of those clumps will frame its sustainability priorities differently.\"Research findings and lessons According to Bressers and O'Toole's 1998 work, \"The Selection of Policy Instruments: A Network-Based Perspective\", which the biodiesel study updates, policymakers in subsystems with high interconnectedness and low cohesion\u2014one of four combinations of high/low interconnectedness and cohesion\u2014would produce policies or regulations with characteristics represented by parentheses below:Provision or withdrawal of resources (Limited withdrawal);Freedom of choice to apply (Absent);Unilateral or bilateral action on target groups (Many bi- or multilateral arrangements);Normative appeal (Present);Proportionality (Present, Individualized); andRole of policy makers in implementation (Implementation by a policy maker or affiliated organizations)Professor Mukherjee compared how the three Indonesian biofuel governance policies matched up to a preference for policy characteristics aligned with high interconnectedness and low cohesion, finding mixed results.\"Bressers and O'Toole's theory has been tested in different contexts, but despite those different contexts, they have shown similar results,\" Professor Mukherjee elaborates, referring to policies in a high interconnectedness/low cohesion subsystem would have the same characteristics. \"Here, it is not the case. The beauty of the theory is that you should be able to test it in any subsystem [and get the same results].\"\"With regard to the resource-based policy variable, Indonesia's biofuel governance follows what we would expect from a poor alignment of goals\u2014that is, a focus on punitive resource withdrawal (i.e., No. 1),\" she notes.\"In further agreement with the hypothesis, this punitive tendency is mediated by Indonesia's high interconnectedness, resulting in the incentives of the national mandate and the loosening of the withdrawal capacity of forestry laws. Across other policy variables, however, overall consistency is lacking\u2014except for the national mandate (i.e., No. 2), for which most of the six variables are aligned with the network structure.\"One feature of Indonesia's biodiesel governance is the concentration of powerful central policy actors. Specifically, the central actors in this case are government agencies in the form of the ministries of agriculture and energy that affect the design of the policies. As a result, a more nuanced approach is necessary, incorporating centrality, to evaluate the impact of policy networks on sustainability governance, says Professor Mukherjee.\"Firstly, the degree of centrality in policy networks should be tested as an explanatory variable of policy choice\u2014that is, to what extent are certain parts of the network concentrated in the center and thereby given favorable positions to formulate policy end up impacting what elements get included in the design of a policy instrument?\"\"Secondly, the study acknowledges dominance as a missing factor in the research. When singular actors are dominant in a network of high interconnectedness, policy selection may resemble conditions of low interconnectedness, making it an important factor to account for.\" More information:Ishani Mukherjee, Fueling green connections: Networked policy instrument choices for sustainability regulation, Review of Policy Research (2022).

  "text": "Defense lawyers face numerous challenges accessing and reviewing evidence from phones and computers, a new study shows.          Solicitors and barristers have reported their use of digital evidence can be restricted by limited or late access, large volumes of material, and tight turnaround times to secure legal aid funding and choose and instruct independent experts.The research calls for more clarity and transparency around the collection and analysis of digital evidence and the streamlining of the format and presentation of information.The current volume and diversity of digital evidence available escalates tensions, delays access to digital evidence and increases turnaround times for analysis.Researchers surveyed 70 criminal law solicitors and barristers and carried out 22 interviews with 23 criminal law solicitors and barristers in early 2022.Respondents noted how even 1GB of data produces unmanageable amounts of evidence to review. This means lawyers can feel unable to examine all the evidence presented by the prosecution and sometimes rely on the summaries provided by the prosecution. The inability to undertake independent checks can also result in omitting important details that can lead to miscarriages of justice.The largest challenges identified were gaining access to data, the time taken to access and identify the relevant information, the ability to use the data in the format provided, and the difficulties processing and understanding data.The research, by Dana Wilson-Kovacs and Rebecca Helm from the University of Exeter, Beth Growns from the University of Canterbury New Zealand and Lauren Redfern from King's College London, is published open access in The International Journal of Evidence & Proof.Professor Helm said, \"There is a widespread need to raise the levels of understanding of digital evidence by all, including how it is gathered and when and how it may be challenged. Improving lawyers' own digital literacy is key to ensuring they can adequately represent the interests of their clients.\"\"Respondents noted that \"inaccessible\" format and presentation of digital evidence presented by the prosecution could be \"difficult to navigate and laborious to decipher.\" Some described receiving \"data dumps\" which would slow down the progress of already overstretched defense teams. Respondents discussed the lack of timely access to data as another factor that could restrict both the legal aid funding stream and the capabilities of the defense.Professor Wilson-Kovacs said, \"Some criminal defense lawyers may attempt to analyze data themselves because of the volume received from prosecution, the short time they have to prepare a response and secure legal aid funding, the limited amount of that funding and the independent expertise it pay for. This increases the risk of essential information being missed.\"\"Those involved in the study said even when defense expert witnesses were secured, access to other relevant data held by the police depended largely on the goodwill of the prosecution and would typically occur too late to be able to undertake any meaningful analysis. The digital evidence made available to defense teams often lacked detail and context or was so heavily redacted that it was impossible to follow.\" More information:Dana Wilson-Kovacs et al, Digital evidence in defence practice: Prevalence, challenges and expertise, The International Journal of Evidence & Proof (2023).

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the term for a strategy that involves randomization?",
  "answer_squad": " Pareto",
  "text": "Consider an auction. You have two types of main protagonists or agents: a seller (or auctioneer) and many potential buyers. There are, of course, certain ground rules. For instance, one objective may be to design the auction in such a way that the person buying the item(s) up for sale is the buyer \"who values that good the most.\"          But, says Singapore Management University Associate Professor of Economics Takashi Kunimoto, what if you do not know which potential buyer does give the item the highest valuation?\"For example, I want to design a scheme in such a way that they're willing to tell the truth about their valuation, and I can choose the person who values it the most. So that's the kind of framework I have in mind to determine who's going to be a winner, with what probability, and who pays how much.\"Professor Kunimoto, whose research interests include game theory, mechanism design, and macroeconomic theory, has written a paper in conjunction with two other SMU researchers, Professor of Economics Shurojit Chatterji, and Research Fellow Paulo Ramos, titled \"Compellingness in Nash Implementation.\"John Nash, who featured in the Russell Crowe movie \"A Beautiful Mind,\" was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1994 for his work on the mathematics of game theory. Professor Kunimoto says that, when it comes to a group of agents interacting with each other\u2014whether it be in an auction or in an institution or organization\u2014he has to make a \"fundamental assumption about where their interactions will lead,\" often referred to as \"Nash equilibrium.\" (This is when no player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy and consequently is \"somehow locked in and therefore cannot find anything better.\")One potential issue with this framework, however, is that there may be many different Nash equilibria. \"As a designer I don't really know which one is going to be played,\" says Professor Kunimoto.This is where Nash implementation comes in. \"Can I design a mechanism in such a way that every Nash equilibrium delivers an outcome I want to implement?\"Another Nobel laureate, Eric Maskin, had already established this basic framework, Professor Kunimoto told the Office of Research, but \"one issue was omitted in literature. Even though you're looking at many equilibria, somehow they only focus on 'pure strategy' equilibria so they don't resort to randomization.\" (Pure strategy implies that the player chooses the same strategy each time in a deterministic manner).      This is where the classic example of a penalty shoot-out in football comes in. There is a striker and a goalkeeper. They can go left or right (although, in reality, there are other options). It is, as Professor Kunimoto points out, a zero-sum game. Either the striker scores or does not. \"So, my best strategy is the worst strategy for the other. There's a complete conflict of interest.\"In this zero-sum game, the equilibrium play entails randomization, implying that the striker does not always try to place the ball in the same part of the net. \"But implementing such a randomizing strategy might be quite sophisticated.\"\"When I say that with Nash implementation, every Nash equilibrium delivers the right outcome, somehow I implicitly assume they're going to play some pure strategy which involves no randomization.\"Professor Kunimoto then opts for a mixed strategy approach which does involve randomization and \"should be even better\" at predicting outcomes. \"If that's the case, maybe I'd better be more careful about how I design the mechanism.\"Of course, the mixed strategy equilibrium could be less likely to be played than the pure strategy equilibrium. If this is the case, one can call such a mixed strategy equilibrium 'not compelling.\" On the contrary, the mixed strategy equilibrium could be more likely to be played than the pure strategy equilibrium. In this case, one can call such a mixed strategy equilibrium 'compelling.\"But, on the assumption that more than one mixed strategy could be played, \"one might be called 'compelling' and the other might not.\" (In the paper, the researchers call a mixed strategy equilibrium 'compelling' if its outcome Pareto\u2014an action resulting in no one losing out although it helps one party\u2014dominates any pure strategy outcome.)To what extent then does the design of the mechanism need to be modified?\"The question is fundamental and was already addressed in the literature,\" says Professor Kunimoto, \"but somehow it was overlooked and that's the context of the question I'm interested in.\"As we have seen, many assumptions are made in understanding the plausibility of both pure and mixed strategy equilibria in Nash implementation. However, isn't a study of just two participating parties or agents somewhat limited in its focused approach?\"Yes, but we encountered difficulty characterizing how mixed strategy equilibria look like in the mechanism with more than two agents. To avoid some of the technical issues, we decided to confine our attention to the case of two agents.\"\"When I design a mechanism, I do not necessarily look at one that works in the real world. To do that, maybe I have to come up with some robustness requirement, which, I hope, leads us to more natural mechanisms.\"\"I just hope that finding a more natural mechanism might lead to a mechanism which might work in the real world, and I think my contribution is going to be somehow pushing this agenda towards finding more effective institutions\u2014but it's still a long way off.\"\"Hopefully if we provide the set of guidelines, policymakers and others may find some of the applications useful, although given what I've said in the paper, it's still a long shot.\"As for the paper itself, it has yet to be published and is likely to need some revision.For instance, in the abstract, the researchers state that they \"illustrate the difficulty of extending our result to the case of more than two agents.\"\"When we extend our results to environments with three or more agents in a straightforward manner,\" the paper concludes, \"the class of environments in which compelling implementation is possible becomes very small.\"Professor Kunimoto says, however, they can handle more than two agents as this, he acknowledges, \"was a significant limitation in the draft paper. Fortunately, we're almost able to overcome that deficiency.\"To do that, they are now considering \"mini versions of the two-person case, but in many pairs.\"In essence, it all comes down to 'reverse engineering' game theory. Instead of trying to make predictions about how the game is going to be played, \"we want to go the other way round this,\" Professor Kunimoto says.\"Somehow, I really want a particular prediction to be consistent with the objective I want to achieve. I want to design a mechanism but the outcome is going to be exactly the one I want implemented.\" Provided bySingapore Management UniversityCitation:Exploring 'compellingness' in mechanism design (2023, May 26)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-exploring-compellingness-mechanism.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Since ancient times, religious beliefs and practices have been a powerful force in shaping morality, justice, values and the things that influence a society.          However, with increased secularism, does religion still play such a role?To understand the role of religion in society, Assistant Professor Justin Tse decided to focus on the influence of Catholicism on 'social dreaming'\u2014a term that defines an idealized vision of a society that is just, democratic and respectful of human rights, and governed by the rule of law.In speaking to the Office of Research, he said, \"Given Catholicism is one of the largest and most practiced religions in the world, I thought that it would be a good place to start.\"In his latest research project titled \"Catholic Talk, Social Dreaming: Civil Service Discourse in Ukraine and Hong Kong,\" two social movements\u2014one each in Ukraine and Hong Kong\u2014were chosen to study the phenomenon. These two movements not only attracted a huge following of secular participants, they also garnered some support from the local Catholic church.The first social movement that Professor Tse examined was the post-maidan Ukraine movement. In the period between November 2013 and February 2014, tens of thousands of people went to Maidan\u2014the main and central square in Kyiv, to protest against President Viktor Yanukovych's push for alignment with Russia rather than with the European Union.This movement attracted highly visible support from the local Catholic priests, who were frequently photographed and filmed by international media at the frontline of the anti-government protests that often turned violent.The other social movement, which took place in Hong Kong from September to December 2014, drew parallels to Ukraine. While the cause was different, both secular participants and the local Catholic church promoted democracy, urging Beijing to adhere to the 'one country, two systems' constitution that was introduced after the cessation of British rule in Hong Kong.Known as the Umbrella Movement as protestors used umbrellas to protect themselves against tear gas, pepper spray and police batons, this movement attracted support from the retired Cardinal Joseph Zen Ze-kiun, who was from the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong.Professor Tse said, \"These two similar yet isolated movements provided a good test bed to determine the relationship between the Catholic church and the concept of social dreaming. In each of the movements, Catholic priests were drawn to the front line. They participated alongside the secular participants to push for what they deemed as the ideal social dreaming for their respective countries. They offered prayers. They appealed to the broader society to support the causes and so on.\"\"While it was evident that the priests and the secular participants were aligned to the same cause in the two countries, what was not clear was whether there was a convergence or a divergence of views in the aftermath of these movements,\" he continued.      The researchThe research, which took place in 2021 and 2022, was led by Professor Tse and Halyna Herasym, a Ph.D. candidate at the University College Dublin and a researcher at the Ukrainian Centre for Law and Crime Research.The methodology used was a mixed method comprising 60 in-depth interviews (10 Catholic priests and 20 protestors in each location) and an examination of archival audiovisual data during and after the movements.Part 1 of the research focused on getting insights from the Catholic priests whereas Part 2 recorded the secular participants' experience in each location.Given that both researchers are fluent in local languages, specifically in Ukrainian and Cantonese, they were able to draw out nuances and detect local inferences that might have been missed if the interviews were solely conducted in English.Additionally, the research team took time to understand the role of the Vatican. Pope Francis, who came into papacy in 2013, is unlike the popes before him. He is a progressive pope and is not afraid to adapt the teachings of Catholicism to the modernized version of an ideal society.FindingsThe in-depth interviews revealed that both the Catholic priests and secular participants are aligned in terms of promoting a social dream and a society that is civil, democratic and just.The research showed that there was trust bestowed on the local Catholic churches in their support for building a better future for the local communities.Other than providing physical and spiritual support in the form of presence and prayers, the church was seen to provide material support to the protestors in their pursuit of social dreaming. By material, the church was seen to lend its buildings and infrastructure, for the protestors to use.Professor Tse hastens to add that while church spaces became important as infrastructure for some of the movements, it does not represent complete alignment between the church and secular participants. Those involved in the movements tended to appropriate from the church, while the church as an institution was not always neatly aligned to their aims.Additionally, what was visibly lacking in both movements was the support from the Vatican even though Pope Francis himself has promoted the concept of social dreaming at the global level, especially in the area of protecting human rights.Next stepsWhile the research showed the importance of social dreaming between the local Catholic church and secular participants, what is still not clear is: What does an idealized vision of social dreaming look like?This is the reason why Professor Tse is applying for the Ministry of Education Academic Research Funding (AcRF) Tier 1 grant to further the project.He commented, \"There are two routes that we could take to increase our understanding on the role of religion in influencing social dreaming. We could either expand our work by delving into the influencing roles of the different religions in the world, or we could go deeper by delving into the ways by which Catholicism is playing a part in social dreaming across the globe.\"\"Depending on the outcomes from the research, I foresee many implications that we can apply from this work, of which, one entails getting policy makers to include religious input in developing policies to create a better future for the local communities,\" he continued.

  "answer_race": " Positive.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the political party that was voted in by the people of Timor-Leste?",
  "answer_squad": " Fretilin party",
  "text": "After a spirited election campaign, the people of Timor-Leste voted for a new parliament on May 21. The vote was free, fair and largely uneventful. The results were accepted. This is a remarkable accomplishment for democracy.          With roughly 40% of the vote and 31 out of 65 seats, Xanana Gusm\u00e3o's National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CNRT) looks set to lead a new coalition government. His coalition would replace the current government consisting of the Fretilin party, which developed from the revolutionary movement that fought for independence from Portugal and then against occupation by Indonesia from the 1970s, along with three smaller parties.This is simply how democracy should work. But in reality, it's a major achievement.Timor-Leste's story represents a decidedly rough ride towards a parliamentary democracy. Following 400 years of colonial rule by Portugal, East Timor enjoyed brief independence in 1975 before being invaded and brutally occupied by Indonesia. This invasion led to the deaths of approximately 200,000 people.After Timorese voters endorsed independence in a 1999 referendum, Indonesia backed-militias unleashed a terror campaign that killed thousands and destroyed nearly all of the country's infrastructure. International peacekeepers were required to restore order and East Timor was placed under United Nations trusteeship.Even after independence in 2002, when the country formally adopted the name Timor-Leste, the country still faced extreme poverty and daunting developmental challenges, all while working to build a new state from the ground up. The rapid departure of UN peacekeepers in 2005 was quickly followed by a political crisis in 2006.What began with a domestic military dispute between competing regional factions in early 2006, rapidly spiraled into a large-scale, violent clash between domestic political elites. Violence and instability threatened to collapse democratic governance and even the state itself. The crisis ultimately led to 36 deaths and 150,000 people displaced.International peacekeepers returned to provide security in the aftermath of the crisis. There were free and fair elections in 2007, which ultimately resolved competition between opposing political elites without violence.Since then, Timor-Leste has consolidated its democracy. Indeed, it is now the only country in south-east Asia rated by the US-based political advocacy group as \"free\".      Surprising successHow did Timor-Leste achieve this surprising success? As I highlight in my recent book, Contending Orders: Legal Pluralism and the Rule of Law, the people of Timor-Leste beat the odds by drawing on their history of collective resistance. The country was able to establish new institutions capable of turning aspirations of a democratic state into reality.The decades-long independence struggle brought together diverse interests and groups, from both inside the country and throughout the world. This diverse coalition worked together to promote a shared vision of a future independent and vibrantly democratic Timor-Leste\u2014a vision that stood in stark contrast to life under authoritarian Indonesian rule.As independence grew near, these groups splintered in the run up to the country's first elections in 2001. Two particularly important factions emerged: Fretilin headed by Mari Alkatiri, and supporters of Gusm\u00e3o who now leads the CNRT. From the start, politics were often messy, even divisive, but also provided voters with a real choice among multiple, legitimate political parties. Parties competing for votes became normal.Even though the 2006 crisis ended up strengthening democracy in the long term, the violence could easily have been a prelude to major civil strife. Instead, it created an enduring distaste among political elites for open, potentially violent confrontation that could easily undermine, or even destroy, democratic governance.Parliamentary democracyConstitutionally, Timor-Leste established a political order where parliament and the prime minister, not the president, are predominant.Parliamentarians are selected by an electoral system of proportional representation that incentivises compromise and coalition building. Indeed, coalition governments have become the norm.Timor-Leste's experience also highlights the importance of securing support from powerful non-state local justice community leaders, who still enjoy legal authority rooted in local customs and traditions that often predate even Portuguese rule. These individuals had long maintained order locally and were crucial in resisting Indonesian rule. Since independence, they have been essential to both strengthening the local legitimacy of the state and extending its reach far beyond what would otherwise be possible.Timor-Leste also holds important lessons for international support. It demonstrates the role external aid can play in providing security and support for building a new state. External assistance was generally not compromised by ulterior motives, such as securing mineral resources or concerns about fighting terrorism.Moreover, the international community generally followed the lead of national leaders, rather than trying to impose unwanted policies or practices. Timor-Leste also shows the importance of not picking winners. The international community was willing to work with whoever was elected without putting a finger on the scale.To be sure, Timor-Leste still faces serious political challenges, including reducing corruption, fostering sustainable economic development, using the petroleum fund effectively and tackling poverty. Likewise, more needs to be done to fully establish the rule of law and ensure essential rights and freedoms are consistently respected. But these challenges should not obscure Timor-Leste's extraordinary democratic achievement.

  "answer_race": " To introduce a research on partisan cues.",
  "question_squad": " What was the budget for the video?",
  "answer_squad": " $100,000",
  "text": "A large-scale study to see if politically partisan cues can induce people to get COVID-19 vaccines found that, yes, they can.          The researchers created a video ad campaign\u2014with Fox News clips about Donald Trump supporting vaccinations\u2014and the ad led to an increase in vaccines across numerous counties by a total of more than 100,000.The study involved creating a 27-second video compilation of Trump's comments about the vaccine from Fox News interviews. The researchers then presented the video to millions of U.S. YouTube users in October 2021.Results indicate that the resulting video campaign increased the number of vaccines in each county where the video was shown by 103 on average, multiplied by 1,014 counties. The study did not include any counties where at least 50% of people were already vaccinated. The budget was about $100,000, coming to $1 or less per vaccine.\"The campaign was cost-effective,\" said Brad Larsen, an associate professor of economics at Olin Business School and lead author of \"Counter-stereotypical messaging and partisan cues: Moving the needle on vaccines in a polarized U.S.,\" which was accepted for publication at the journal Science Advances.The research has more implications for Americans' health. The partisan divide has spilled over to other vaccines as well, with Republicans now far less likely than Democrats to get flu shots or to view other immunizations positively\u2014a divide that did not exist before the pandemic.The deepest fault lineThe Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that, among the 27% of American adults who remained unvaccinated for COVID in late October 2021, 60% were Republicans, far above their share in the electorate. Although race, ethnicity, income, urbanicity, education and age also were associated with Americans' decisions to get vaccinated, political partisanship was the deepest fault line, the paper reported.For their research, the scholars wondered if a remedy for the partisan divide over COVID vaccines might stem from mechanisms like those that created the disparity in the first place: partisan cues. Of course, research already showed that many people form preferences by following cues from their party leaders, a regularity that has grown stronger as the parties have polarized.New Olin Business School research demonstrates the effectiveness of partisan cues in a COVID-19 vaccination video ad campaign. Credit: Washington University in St. LouisThey thought that messages publicizing Trump's support for COVID-19 vaccines\u2014support he did little to advertise after leaving the White House\u2014might inspire the vaccine-hesitant among his supporters to get vaccinated. So, Larsen and co-authors created the public service announcement (PSA) featuring news clips of Trump on Fox News encouraging people to get vaccinated. By using both Trump and Fox\u2014inconsistent messengers about the seriousness of the pandemic\u2014they created a counter-stereotypical message.The study co-authors are Timothy Ryan and Marc Hetherington from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Steven Greene from North Carolina State University, Rahsaan Maxwell from New York University and Steven Tadelis from the University of California, Berkeley.      'A political remedy'The PSA includes four separate video clips: The first and third are from a Fox 13 News Utah segment recorded on March 16, 2021. The second is from a phone interview between Donald Trump and anchor Maria Bartiromo recorded on the Fox News Channel on the same date. The fourth is from a social media post of Ivanka Trump from the spring of 2021. The researchers hired a video editor to combine the clips and overlay them with a soundtrack.Knowing that many users might stop the PSA from playing as soon as possible, news of Trump's endorsement needed to occur immediately, Larsen said. Within the first three seconds of the ad, the Fox 13 Utah anchor says, \"Donald Trump is urging all Americans to get the COVID-19 vaccine.\"\"It catches people's attention, and it can change the way they think,\" Larsen said. \"And that was our hope.\"He and his colleagues tested the ad through a large randomized controlled trial on YouTube, targeting counties that lagged in vaccine uptake. Overall, a total of 11.6 million ads reached 6 million unique viewers. They then measured the effect of the campaign on county-level vaccination counts in data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The total increase in vaccinations after the campaign was 104,036, costing about $1 or less in ad spending per vaccine.\"Given plentiful evidence of small, undetectable effects of public messaging in other settings, these results are encouraging and represent a large return on investment,\" the authors write. \"The result also highlights an approach to increase vaccinations for a fraction of the cost of other interventions, such as vaccine lotteries or direct payments.\"In short, we find that a problem with political origins also has a political remedy.\" More information:Bradley Larsen et al, Counter-stereotypical Messaging and Partisan Cues: Moving the Needle on Vaccines in a Polarized U.S., Science Advances (accepted 2023).

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards greenwashing?",
  "answer_race": " Critical.",
  "question_squad": " What is the term for a company that uses CSR to mask its environmental practices?",
  "answer_squad": " greenwashing",
  "text": "Companies implement corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a way to present an environmentally responsible image and therefore gain legitimacy in the eyes of their stakeholders. But some companies don't actually live up to their claims.          Some businesses claim to be doing good for the environment, but don't. Often they undertake green projects only for marketing purposes or to brand their products. Or they do only what legislation and stakeholder pressure force them to.But others use CSR to achieve long-term competitive advantages. They see these \"sustainable strategies\" as a core part of their overall corporate strategy. They align their social commitments with their business objectives. They commit to responsible business practices that reduce their carbon footprint and minimize negative environmental impact.To understand better the strategic corporate social responsibility, we analyzed relevant studies and theories on CSR strategies. We concluded that companies disclose positive communication while they undertake irresponsible practices. We distinguish two types of CSR strategies:those introduced to cope with environmental and social legislation and the stakeholders' pressure (responsive CSR); andstrategies considering CSR as a differentiation process aligning social, environmental and financial performances.In a second study, we examined how corporate lobbying could help businesses overcome their irresponsible actions and improve their CSR strategy, specifically after a greenwashing scandal. We explained how this type of incident could bring opportunities to meet stakeholders' calls for action and how lobbying could drive a cleaner market image.We looked at how big firms such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP in the energy sector use CSR to legitimize their bad practices. An example is posting misleading messaging on the social media about investing in low carbon projects, yet increasing exploration rather than decreasing it.The energy sector is among the biggest polluters in the world. It produced 73.2% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2016.We found that energy companies used CSR projects to mask their environmentally destructive practices. They also misled the public about environmental achievements\u2014a practice referred to as greenwashing. The studies also set out why, and how, civil society can play an active role in promoting sustainable practices.      The studies Based on a survey of the literature reviewing different methodologies of more than 100 studies, we conclude that it is frequent that businesses in different sectors use elementary strategies to comply with social and environmental regulations. They aim to gain legitimacy in the stakeholders' eyes without making corporate social responsibility a cornerstone of their overall strategy.Secondly, the studies address how ambiguous claims, sophisticated euphemisms, or pure lies have become frequent in business communication specifically on sustainable and corporate social responsibility activities.Thirdly, the studies explain how companies accused of greenwashing (misleading the public about environmental achievements) could use the scandals to rethink their social and environmental strategies and introduce effective changes.Misleading information Energy companies in 55 countries are committed to the Paris Agreement and a net-zero emission world, aiming at keeping global heating under 1.5\u2103. But a US congressional investigation that analyzed 200 pages of internal corporate memos found oil giants such as Shell, Chevron and ExxonMobil were paying lip service to the agreement.We can read, for instance:\"Shell has no immediate plans to move to a net-zero emissions portfolio over our investment horizon of 10-20 years.\"According to Richard Wiles, president of the Centre for Climate Integrity, these revelations are \"the latest evidence that oil giants keep lying about their commitments to solve the climate crisis and should never be trusted by policymakers.\"However, we also argue that there are negative as well as potential positive outcomes from greenwashing.Negatives and positives The negative effects of greenwashing, such as misleading and manipulating consumers, avoiding concrete actions and blocking green transition, can be significant.The continuous exposure to green claims inspired by superficial green branding can shape and establish new social norms. And research has found that, greenwashing can ultimately undermine the establishment of sustainable social norms by eroding trust and credibility in green claims.But there's the potential for companies to use a negative situation as an opportunity to initiate positive changes. This is particularly the case when stakeholders, policy and market makers and researchers raise awareness of these practices. Consumers can call for more transparency and hold companies more accountable when they misbehave.The 2015 Volkswagen case is instructive. The US government found \"irregularities\" in tests measuring carbon dioxide emissions levels affecting thousands of cars produced by the German company. The settlement with the US Environmental Protection Agency pushed the company to invest in electric vehicle infrastructure and technology. Volkswagen has subsequently become a key player in the electric vehicle market.The public commitment made by companies can also inspire employees to work towards these goals and help to establish a standard for corporate sustainability.Role of civil society The outcomes of greenwashing can be heavily influenced by civil society.In February 2023, the international NGO Global Witness accused one of the largest oil company, Shell, of misleading the US authorities and investors on its green transition. In our study, we conclude thatwhen consumers become aware of socially irresponsible behavior, their positive identification of the company is interrupted.Shell disclosed in its 2021 annual report that 12% of its capital expenditure was dedicated to the development of renewable and green energy solutions. However, only 1.5% was used to develop solar and wind sources and power plants. Global Witness found that the company was undertaking climate-wrecking gas projects.The NGO has lodged a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US to investigate Shell's claims.This is not a unique scandal in which Shell is involved.A Dutch court in 2021 found Shell's subsidiary responsible for the oil spills between 2004 and 2007 in Nigeria. It ordered the company to pay compensation to the four Nigerian farmers who initiated the lawsuit. Shell's reputation was severely impaired.The company has pledged to compensate the Nigerian farmers with \u20ac15 million and install a leak detection system.Shell also partnered with an environmental activist think tank, British Cycling to deliver a green image and enhance the acceptance and desirability of its products and services. But, very quickly, British Cycling was accused of greenwashing.Ordinary citizens have been part of the increase in greenwashing awareness. For instance, they have launched many environmental \"name and shame\" campaigns against giants. In July 2020, misleading communication by Air France about its CO\u2082-neutral flights was retweeted multiple times.Next steps A carbon footprint can only be evaluated if the consequences and emissions associated with a range of technologies are taken into account. These range from raw material extraction to disposal or recycling. Many renewable energy technologies still rely to some extent on fossil fuels. It is essential to continuously improve their sustainability and efficiency to achieve a low carbon future.Many businesses are taking advantage of this complexity and marketing to greenwash their business models without making significant changes.To combat this, the following is needed:transparencyeffective regulationmonitoringa genuine and proactive environmental approach to corporate and social responsibility projects.Provided byThe Conversation  This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

  "text": "High school and middle school students in remote learning environments are more likely to be exposed to identity-based harassment, and have a greater likelihood of reporting the behavior, according to researchers. The findings suggest that employing transparency, streamlined reporting processes and restorative practices could help educators combat this type of bullying, which has been increasing since the COVID-19 pandemic caused many schools to adopt remote learning modalities.          Witnessing and experiencing bias-based bullying (BBB)\u2014or bullying that targets a person based on their \"perceived membership to a historically marginalized group, including race/ethnicity, sexual or gender identity, or immigrant status\"\u2014impacts students' perceptions of safety, said Seria Chatters, assistant vice provost for Educational Equity and adjunct teaching professor of education (counselor education) at Penn State.\"I think schools could recognize they could get a big bang for their buck if they are educating students to be able to recognize these situations, respond to them and give students an in-depth understanding of the reporting system,\" she said.\"We believe this is one of the first studies that examined how remote learning during the pandemic affected witnessing and reporting of BBB,\" said lead author Isak Kim, an assistant professor in the Clinical Mental Health Counseling program at the University of Nebraska\u2014Omaha, who received a doctorate in counselor education from Penn State in 2021.In their study, published in the Journal of School Heath, the researchers collected a data sample of middle- and high-school students in a school district in the eastern United States as part of the No Place For Hate (NPFH) project\u2014a holistic, schoolwide approach to improving school climate administered by ADL Education.In the study, participants were asked to answer sociodemographic questions, including grade, gender, race/ethnicity and disability status. The students also were asked questions to identify their learning modality (in-person versus remote learning), their experiences of witnessing BBB and harassment, and their perceptions of school fairness.In addition, students were asked how likely they'd be to report an act of bias or hate if they were personally witnessed by the student, or committed by a peer (student), teacher or administrator to assess their likelihood of reporting.      The researchers' findings suggest that, overall, students who attended school virtually during the pandemic reported higher levels of witnessing BBB, greater likelihood of reporting BBB, and lower ratings for school fairness when compared to students who opted for traditional in-person learning.Still, the researchers also found that, among those students who reported BBB, perceived school fairness was positively associated with likelihood of reporting BBB, even when considering the influences of sociodemographic characteristics, learning modality and experience of witnessing BBB.According to the researchers, the increased prevalence of cyber-bullying behaviors among youth populations may help to explain the relationship between learning modality and witnessing/reporting BBB. They also cited research that suggests that when adolescents assume equal treatment and equitable application of rules, they are more likely to follow school policies.\"What we saw was students were taking more liberties in bullying students both in-person and online but because when everything shifted to online, it provided more opportunities to happen in an online space,\" said Deanna Burgess, an assistant professor in the DePaul College of Education, who received her doctorate in counselor education and supervision from Penn State, is the paper's second co-author.Negative effects of BBB include increased feelings of sadness, decreased self-esteem, loss of friends and limited sense of school belonging and safety as well as possibly higher rates of suicidality, particularly among LGBTQ and BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) populations.A barrier in counteracting cyberbullying, Kim said, is that it tends to be less visible due to the inherent constraints of online spaces and BBB also can be less visible than other forms of bullying.\"The intersection of the two forms contributes to less visibility and prevention efforts,\" said Kim.An additional complication, said Chatters, is that schools have limited jurisdictions when it comes to cyberbullying.There are a number of reasons why students who witness BBB may not report, Burgess said, including fear of retaliation by peers, doubt that there will be appropriate disciplinary consequences for the bully or concerns that school personnel would minimize the victimization experience.\"Youth commonly report that their experience isn't taken seriously when reported to school personnel who do not hold historically minoritized identities, personnel who also hold biased attitudes or beliefs, or when the action is presented as peer-to-peer banter, such as racial jokes,\" she said. \"Students are also likely to not report BBB offenses when they share a relationship or an affinity with the perpetrator.\"According to Chatters, educators \"often look at perpetrators more from a disciplinary than an educational lens.\" However, she said, research has shown many bullies have experienced bullying in the past so she recommends looking at restorative ways of repairing harmful behaviors, such as adopting schoolwide initiatives that foster prosocial values and morals.Kim emphasized the importance of perception of school fairness, as well as awareness of a safe, anonymous way to report BBB.\"If students feel like nothing will change, they are less likely to report BBB,\" Kim said.\"It is important to ensure that all school personnel have been trained in intervention actions and that reporting protocols are clearly communicated to all members of the school community,\" Burgess added.

  "question_squad": " What percentage of people are honest on their taxes?",
  "answer_squad": " 85%",
  "text": "Government officials can do the math and figure out how much taxation they need to cover everything from military defense to bridges, education and Medicare. The snag, as it's been for millennia, comes when they try to get people to actually pay those taxes.          While the days of a heavy-handed tax collector extracting prompt and honest payment have evolved into audits and the threats of heavy fines, quite a few people still cheat.Besides increasing taxes on honest people, what's a treasury to do?That's a question University of Delaware researcher George Tsakumis considered in research published in the Journal of Business Ethics in March. Tsakumis, an associate professor of accounting in the Alfred Lerner College of Business and Economics, collaborated with friends from his doctoral student days, Diana Falsetta of the University of Miami and Jennifer Schafer of Kennesaw State University.They had all worked as tax consultants for major accounting companies before entering academia, so it was a natural angle to study.About 85% of people are already honest on their taxes, according to IRS research, paying voluntarily and in full. But the tax cheats who make up that other 15% are costing the government a pile of money. Based on data from 2014\u201316, the IRS estimates it loses about $428 billion a year, and other world governments report tax gaps in the hundreds of billions as well, the researchers note.The IRS appears primed to do something about this, with the announcement last year of an $80 billion cash infusion into the agency over a decade. More than half of that is penciled for enforcement, which the agency estimates will more than pay for itself in recovered money.Is enforcement the most effective use of those funds, though? Tsakumis and his fellow researchers reviewed a lot of research about how well audits worked, but they noted a gap in the literature when it came to understanding people's motivations for deciding to pay taxes.They argue that traditional studies focusing on penalties and economic motives are missing part of the picture\u2014an analysis of how taxpayers' feelings about government programs affects their willingness to pay up.Quite a bit, they discovered in their study. The conclusions published in the paper \"How Government Spending Impacts Tax Compliance\" have implications for ways policymakers can encourage taxpayers to actually do the paying part.      To untangle all this, the researchers looked at multiple factors that could affect people's willingness to obey tax rules, including whether they support government programs, and how ethical they are\u2014whether they are likely to act selfishly and take an \"ends justify the means\" approach.Participants in the study were tested on these factors, and fielded questions about their support for defense programs and social welfare programs. Then they were told to put themselves in the shoes of a taxpayer who earned $45,000 in self-employment income, paid in cash. The researchers asked participants to specify how much of this income they would report to the IRS. Some of the participants were told that they were likely to be audited, and others that the probability was low.Researchers queried a little more than 300 taxpayers from around the country, from a variety of ages and different income and education levels.\"In a nutshell, we find that taxpayers with more support for a program report higher amounts of income,\" Tsakumis wrote in an email. They also found that people who support spending on programs like national defense were more likely to honestly report income under threat of an audit, but those who support social programs did not need that nudge.\"When taxpayers do not support government programs, their compliance is lower regardless of the audit probability,\" the study concluded.In other words, regardless of the threat of an audit, people who support government policies are more likely to pay their share.Unethical people, however, took more prying. To be convinced to pay up, \"taxpayers with lower ethical standards need (both) to support a government (program)and be facing a higher probability of an IRS audit,\" Tsakumis said.On the flip side, they found that highly ethical people aren't as affected by their feelings about government spending, since they were going to pay their taxes anyway.The researchers are not arguing that audits and penalties don't work. They just say people are also motivated by their attitude toward government spending and programs than by these enforcement methods.The takeaway is more for government officials than for the average taxpayer, although Tsakumis noted that taxpayers might consider finding out more about the rationale behind programs.\"We feel that our findings highlight the importance of gaining taxpayer support for government programs,\" he wrote, through aligning citizens' interests with those of the government.That is to say, the government needs to persuade people their money is being well spent.\"One way to do this would be for the government to provide taxpayers with a better understanding of why they are being taxed and how they benefit from government spending of their tax dollars,\" Tsakumis said.

It reveals the key characteristics and qualities that make for effective leadership and compares the leadership styles of introverts and extroverts. The review could guide recruiters and human resource managers in improving their hiring practices and leadership development processes, making them more inclusive of introverts when identifying and nurturing potential leaders.          Hevvon A. Barnes of the University of Hartford, Connecticut and Susan M. Stewart of Western Illinois University, Moline, Illinois, U.S., suggest that introverted leaders have long been misunderstood and their review seeks to challenge the deceived wisdom about their abilities. It is possible that by recognizing and valuing the unique strengths, talents, perspectives, and values of introverted leaders organizations could gain a deeper understanding of their contribution and build on it.The team emphasizes that biases abound and while organizations with introverted leaders are obviously effective, the suggestion is that removing those biases and recognizing the potential of introverted leaders could give a significant boost to an organization. Taking proactive steps to address the misconceptions and foster a more balanced and diverse leadership culture, more accepting and respectful of introverts would allow those kinds of leaders to thrive and be more effective in their roles to the ultimate benefit of the organization as a whole. The researchers add that interventions such as training programs, mentorship opportunities, and adjustments to organizational structures and practices might be used to achieve this efficiently.There remain several areas for future research. For instance, there is still a need to explore the experiences of introverted leaders themselves in various organizational contexts and industries. There will also be a need to follow up on how effective particular interventions aimed at promoting the development and success of introverted leaders have been once implemented.

  "text": "People tend to think that the idea that biological sex is linked with one's role in society belongs in the past. But was it even the case in prehistory? Archaeologists at the University of G\u00f6ttingen have investigated the representation of gender in Neolithic and Bronze Age graves (around 5500 BC to 1200 BC), in order to understand if the idea of gender in prehistoric Europe was really as \"binary\" as might be expected.          The researchers found that the role of prehistoric individuals was mostly\u2014but not solely\u2014determined by their biological sex. The researchers, however, also found that the methods currently available leave a lot of room for error. The results were published in the Cambridge Archaeological Journal.Many people assume that the two biological sexes produce two genders. However, if we consider sex and gender separately, there are at least four possible combinations. Identifying gender norms and identities of people in prehistoric societies is a tough challenge for prehistoric archaeologists.Researchers usually estimate the biological sex of prehistoric individuals based on their bones, and determine gender based on the objects that accompanied them in death. This complex conundrum can be simplified as: weapons for men, jewelry for women.The researchers collected and analyzed the available sex and gender data from more than 1,000 individuals buried in large Neolithic and Bronze Age burial sites in Germany, Austria and Italy, spanning nearly 4,000 years of our distant past, and quantified how often sex and gender data matched, and how often they did not.The data shows that 10% of individuals do not fit the 'binary norm', but also that the gender and sex of only about 30% of the total population studied can, in fact, be determined. \"What these numbers tell us,\" says Dr. Eleonore Pape, who carried out this research at the University of G\u00f6ttingen and now works at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, \"is that historically, we can no longer frame non-binary persons as 'exceptions' to a rule, but rather as 'minorities', who could have been formally acknowledged, protected and even revered.\"\"But this is only one possible interpretation,\" adds Dr. Nicola Ialongo, University of G\u00f6ttingen, \"At this time, we still cannot assess the real impact\u2014not only due to error margins of analytical methods (for instance osteology), but also of confirmation bias (meaning people tend to find what they want to find).\" The future inclusion of biomolecular analyses\u2014for instance ancient DNA and proteomics\u2014will allow researchers to clarify our understanding of sex and gender in prehistory.

  "text": "First home buyers (FHBs) in New South Wales (NSW) are finding it more challenging to get into home ownership, and government intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic may be partly to blame.          A recent study of FHBs suggests economic responses during the pandemic to stimulate recovery may have had an inflationary impact on property prices, making it more difficult for those looking to buy their first home. The research, published recently in the journal Buildings, is one of only a few qualitative studies to consider the possible impact of financial stimulus on FHB entry during the pandemic.For the study, researchers surveyed 61 FHBs in NSW about their experience of entering the housing market during the pandemic, where significant COVID-19 economic policies were taking effect, including interest rate cuts, superannuation withdrawals, mortgage payment pauses and income supplementary programs.Around 71% of respondents said their purchase price range had risen throughout the pandemic, and 83% said the process had become harder and more complex, making it more difficult to access home ownership.The researchers concluded that the economic policies\u2014even those aimed at promoting home ownership, such as first home loan deposit schemes\u2014may have been to the detriment of FHBs by consequently driving up the demand for housing and overheating the market.\"The pandemic saw extraordinary economic responses from the government to stabilize the economy and businesses, but they arguably had unintended consequences for FHBs that put them in a more disadvantageous position than before the pandemic,\" says Associate Professor Chyi Lin Lee, a co-author of the study and discipline director of construction management and property at UNSW Sydney.Increasing barriers to home ownershipHome ownership in Australia has been on the decline for decades. One of the main barriers to entry for FHBs is a widening deposit gap, which increased dramatically with rising house prices during the pandemic, Lee says. Capital city property prices increased by nearly 20%, raising the time and money needed to make a down payment.      \"As income to house price ratio continued to expand during the pandemic, FHBs reported taking longer to save up a deposit,\" Lee says. \"Meanwhile, investors, particularly those already in the market who benefited from soaring house prices, can refinance for another purchase and are seen to outbid FHBs easily.\"Respondents emphasized inequality in the market as the most significant challenge, with 48% attributing the difficulties to investors and existing home ownerships' advantages from favorable tax policies when holding or selling property.\"Not only do policies of discount capital gains tax and negative gearing encourage investor activity and further pressure house prices, but monetary policy, such as record low interest rates during the pandemic, may be considered further stimulus to encourage investing,\" Lee says.As a result, FHBs noted increasingly relying on the Bank of Mum and Dad, taking on more financial risk, and relocating to regional areas to enter the market.Just 27% of respondents considered paying a 20% deposit. Meanwhile, 21% of respondents received a gift to assist with their deposit, and around 12% received a guarantee. And 77% also said purchasing any property was more important than finding their ideal home.\"Even before the pandemic, many FHBs were finding it difficult to get into the market, with many predicting the situation will likely get worse,\" Lee says. \"This is driving a fear of missing out, resulting in many taking on higher levels of debt, rushing into purchases without completing thorough due diligence, relocating for affordability reasons or reducing their expectations for their first property.\"Sydney, in particular, has become near impossible to enter without significant assistance and is already the least affordable city in Australia for housing and the second least affordable globally.Although 72% of respondents were potentially eligible for some form of government assistance, only 30% obtained support. And 70% also said government support was insufficient given property prices.While many economic responses have since finished, including historically low interest rates, Lee says FHBs may continue to struggle to enter the market with a reduction in borrowing capacities even if house prices soften.\"Policymakers should consider expanding support for FHBs beyond demand-side subsidies and invest more resources into supply-side interventions, primarily introducing more housing into the market,\" Lee says.\"This would help FHBs who may be disadvantaged by the effects of the pandemic economic stimulus measures long after they've finished.\" More information:Mustapha Bangura et al, The Unintended Consequences of COVID-19 Economic Responses on First Home Buyers?

  "text": "New research has found the lack of new supply, driven by construction cost increases and labor shortages, will significantly affect housing markets over the next two years.          \"Australia will be dealing with the impact of COVID-19 on its housing markets for some time as increased construction costs and a reduced appetite for risk impede new housing supply,\" says Professor Steven Rowley, lead author of new AHURI research released today.The lack of new housing supply predicted in the next two years will have implications for both the home ownership and rental markets. On the positive side, a lack of new private sector development will create capacity in the industry and provide government with an opportunity to accelerate its social housing building program.The research, \"The new normal: changed patterns of dwelling demand and supply,\" undertaken for AHURI by researchers from Curtin University and Monash University examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patterns of housing supply and demand and how the Australian housing market has changed over the last decade.The report found COVID changed what households want from their home: more space, both inside and out, which was linked with the ability to work more from home and a heightened demand for lifestyle locations. The pandemic led to significant and distinct changes in where people wanted to live, with low or negative growth in inner urban areas; growth in regional towns and cities (particularly those associated with sea and tree changes); and strong growth in traditional first home buyer areas, primarily on the urban periphery.\"The pandemic showed us just how quickly demand for housing can change, with a shift to home buyers wanting to escape metropolitan areas; to larger homes and more private space; and to work from home in lifestyle locations,\" says Professor Rowley.However, Professor Rowley believes we are now shifting back towards pre-pandemic patterns of demand.\"While COVID drove some permanent changes, such as working from home opportunities for many, and a surge in regional house prices, the market appears to be returning to pre-pandemic patterns with location and affordability the key drivers. Interest rate rises have played a key part in this with the cost of buying having risen sharply. Tight rental markets across the country have limited household movements.\"      The increase in building costs, combined with construction delays, led to an increased demand for established dwellings. However this situation creates a vicious cycle of housing scarcity.\"Owners of existing properties are reluctant to sell as there are a lack of options to buy. A very tight rental market means renting in between selling and buying a dwelling is difficult,\" said Professor Rowley.Professor Rowley highlighted concerns around new housing supply. \"Increased construction costs resulting from labor and material shortages have played havoc with the multi-residential sector. Many private sector developments are no longer profitable and builders are not wanting to take on the risk of residential development. This will have serious implications for housing markets over the next couple of years, contributing to a housing supply shortage. The lack of new supply and strong population growth means upward pressure on both prices and rents\u2014not good news for potential purchasers or anyone in the rental market\".The report finds that governments must continue to work on policies that make it easier to deliver housing within existing urban areas, and this housing must deliver diversity, not simply be dominated by apartments.\"It will take a partnership between government and the private sector to deliver more diverse housing options in many regional areas where the private sector struggles to operate,\" said Professor Rowley.\"It's critical that government supports community and not-for-profit housing in regional areas where housing demand is acute, but where traditional finance and development models are less feasible,\" he said.\"Governments should take a more direct role in housing supply, including through large scale delivery of social and affordable housing, both in cities and in regional areas. Protecting supply chains and training a workforce to respond to supply pressures is also essential.\" More information:Steven Rowley et al, The new normal: changed patterns of dwelling demand and supply, AHURI Final Report.

  "text": "Strategic decisions and debates about Australian values are shaped in the Anglosphere, a new research paper reveals.          A Monash University paper published in the British Journal of Politics and International Relations identifies how major strategic decisions and debates about national values have been shaped by Australia's role in the \"Anglosphere.\"The report examines how the Anglosphere is important to national debates about identity and public policy in Australia, and provides context for decisions about how Australia positions itself in the world at a time of significant transnational challenges and threats.Monash University researchers in politics and co-authors of the paper, Drs Ben Wellings and Zareh Ghazarian, said the findings highlighted Australia's political leaders have played an under-researched role in the creation of what is known as the Anglosphere.\"When Keating lost the 1996 election to the John Howard-led Coalition, the contestation over which institutions and values should define being Australian helped create the contemporary Anglosphere,\" Dr. Ghazarian said.\"Howard was strongly opposed to Australia becoming a republic and was blamed for breaking the hearts of Australians by maintaining his position in the leadup to the unsuccessful republic referendum in 1999. As an elder statesman he spoke in favor of the Anglosphere idea at think tanks in the US.\"More recently, the Anglosphere was evidenced during the Brexit referendum in 2016, when the UK Secretary of State for Environment drew on the Anglosphere to advance the successful leave campaign.Australia's decision to scrap the contract with France to build new submarines, and instead go with the UK and U.S. for nuclear submarine technologies, reflects the strength of trust between these English-speaking countries in the Anglosphere.\"The contestation over Australian nationhood in the 1990s and 2000s played an under-researched part in the genesis of this idea. The impact of Prime Ministers Howard and Abbott in particular have strengthened Australia's links with Anglosphere nations, especially the UK,\" Dr. Wellings said.\"The Albanese Government's recent decision to proceed with the AUKUS submarine deal consolidates an otherwise amorphous yet powerful Anglosphere idea in international relations.\"The Anglosphere refers to English-speaking countries who share common liberal democratic values, namely, the U.S., UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.The Anglosphere idea in Australia is heavily inflected towards a great respect for the British legacy, more than a promotion of all other four Anglosphere states equally.The labeling of the Anglosphere emerged in the late 1990s, and reflects a project of right-wing politics in English-speaking democracies which impact international relations.The Open Access paper provides a framework to discuss the impact and significance of the Anglosphere and its implications on Australia's domestic policy settings and institutionalized sense of self.

  "question_squad": " What is the most popular model in behavioral economics to describe decision-making under uncertainty?",
  "answer_squad": " prospect theory",
  "text": "How do humans make decisions when the outcomes are uncertain? One possible way would be to calculate the expected value of each option by multiplying each possible outcome amount by its probability and then choosing the option with the highest expected value. While this strategy would maximize the payoff in expectation, this is not what people tend to do. In particular, people seem to be irrationally influenced by past outcomes of their decisions when making subsequent choices.          Researchers from the University of Tsukuba have developed and validated a model (\"dynamic prospect theory\") that integrates the most popular model in behavioral economics to describe decision-making under uncertainty\u2014prospect theory, and a well-established model of learning from neuroscience\u2014reinforcement learning theory. This model more accurately described the decisions that people and monkeys made while facing risk than prospect theory or reinforcement learning theory alone.Specifically, the researchers asked 70 people to repeatedly choose between two lotteries in which they could gain some reward with some probability. The lotteries varied in the size of the reward, the probability of receiving it, and the amount of risk involved. The results showed that immediately after experiencing an outcome that was bigger than the expected value of the selected option, participants behaved as if the probability of winning in the next lottery increased.Senior author of the study Assistant Professor Hiroshi Yamada says \"This behavior is surprising because winning probabilities were clearly described to the participants (participants did not have to learn them from experience) and these probabilities were also completely independent of previous outcomes.\" Using their dynamic prospect theory model, the researchers were able to determine that the change in behavior is driven by a change in the perception of probabilities rather than by a change in valuation of rewards.Yamada also says, \"Such learning from unexpected events underlies reinforcement learning theory and is a well-known algorithm that occurs when people need to learn the rewards from experience. It is interesting that it occurs even if learning is not necessary.\"In similar experiments with macaque monkeys, whose brains closely resemble those of humans, essentially the same results were observed. Researchers commented that the similarity in human and monkey behavior was remarkable in this study.Based on the results of this research, it is expected that the investigation of the monkey brain will lead to an understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in the perception of rewards and probability that all of us use when making risky decisions, as well as the joy we feel when we succeed.The paper is published in the journal Science Advances.

  "text": "A new analysis of ancient feces taken from two Jerusalem latrines dating back to the biblical Kingdom of Judah has uncovered traces of a single-celled microorganism Giardia duodenalis\u2014a common cause of debilitating diarrhea in humans.          A research team led by the University of Cambridge say it is the oldest example we have of this diarrhea-causing parasite infecting humans anywhere on the planet. The study is published in the journal Parasitology.\"The fact that these parasites were present in sediment from two Iron Age Jerusalem cesspits suggests that dysentery was endemic in the Kingdom of Judah,\" said study lead author Dr. Piers Mitchell from Cambridge's Department of Archaeology.\"Dysentery is a term that describes intestinal infectious diseases caused by parasites and bacteria that trigger diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever and dehydration. It can be fatal, particularly for young children.\"\"Dysentery is spread by feces contaminating drinking water or food, and we suspected it could have been a big problem in early cities of the ancient Near East due to overcrowding, heat and flies, and limited water available in the summer,\" said Mitchell.The fecal samples came from the sediment underneath toilets found in two building complexes excavated to the south of the Old City, which date back to the 7th century BCE when Jerusalem was a capital of Judah.During this time, Judah was a vassal state under the control of the Assyrian Empire, which at its height stretched from the Levant to the Persian Gulf, incorporating much of modern-day Iran and Iraq. Jerusalem would have been a flourishing political and religious hub estimated to have had between 8,000 and 25,000 residents.Both toilets had carved stone seats almost identical in design: a shallow curved surface for sitting, with a large central hole for defecation and an adjacent hole at the front for male urination. \"Toilets with cesspits from this time are relatively rare and were usually made only for the elite,\" said Mitchell.One was from a lavishly decorated estate at Armon ha-Natziv, surrounded by an ornamental garden. The site, excavated in 2019, probably dates from the days of King Manasseh, a client king for the Assyrians who ruled for fifty years in the mid-7th century.

Credit: Ya\u2019akov Billig             The site of the other toilet, known as the House of Ahiel, was a domestic building made up of seven rooms, housing an upper-class family at the time. Date of construction is hard to pin down, with some placing it around the 8th century BCE.However, its destruction is safely dated to 586 BCE, when Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar II brutally sacked Jerusalem for a second time after its citizens refused to pay their agreed tribute, bringing to an end the Kingdom of Judah.Ancient medical texts from Mesopotamia during the first and second millennium BCE describe diarrhea affecting the populations of what is now the Near and Middle East. One example reads: \"If a person eats bread and drinks beer and subsequently his stomach is colicky, he has cramps and has a flowing of the bowels, setu has gotten him.\"The cuneiform word often used in these texts to describe diarrhea was s\u00e0 si-s\u00e1. Some texts also included recommended incantations for reciting to increase the chances of recovery.\"These early written sources do not provide causes of diarrhea, but they encourage us to apply modern techniques to investigate which pathogens might have been involved,\" said Mitchell. \"We know for sure that Giardia was one of those infections responsible.\"The team investigated the two-and-a-half-thousand year-old decomposed biblical period feces by applying a bio-molecular technique called \"ELISA,\" in which antibodies bind onto the proteins uniquely produced by particular species of single-celled organisms.\"Unlike the eggs of other intestinal parasites, the protozoa that cause dysentery are fragile and extremely hard to detect in ancient samples through microscopes without using antibodies,\" said co-author and Cambridge Ph.D. candidate Tianyi Wang.The researchers tested for Entamoeba, Giardia and Cryptosporidium: three parasitic microorganisms that are among the most common causes of diarrhea in humans, and behind outbreaks of dysentery. Tests for Entamoeba and Cryptosporidium were negative, but those for Giardia were repeatedly positive.Previous research has dated traces of the Entamoeba parasite, which also causes dysentery, as far back as Neolithic Greece over 4,000 years ago. Previous work has also shown that users of ancient Judean toilets were infected by other intestinal parasites including whipworm, tapeworm and pinworm.This research was undertaken through a collaboration between the University of Cambridge, Tel Aviv University, and the Israel Antiquities Authority.

  "text": "New research from Copenhagen Business School, along with Leuphana University and University of Turku sheds light on the importance of subtracting as much as adding in the journey of digital workplace transformation.          The research focused on one of the world's oldest car manufacturers who employs more than 200,000 employees worldwide and who launched its digital workplace transformation strategy in 2016.\"The subtraction logic, that is, the process of removing obstructive routines and technologies, is often disregarded in digital workplace transformation, despite being equally crucial,\" says co-author and Associate Professor Abayomi Baiyere at the department of digitalization, Copenhagen Business School.The findings highlight two approaches to a successful digital transformation: the addition logic of incorporating new technology and the subtraction logic of eliminating old technology that sustains unwanted practices. By emphasizing the need for subtraction logic alongside addition logic, the research unveils a critical aspect often neglected in digital workplace transformation.\"By recognizing the value of subtraction logic and not taking a one-sided focus on just the addition logic, organizations can foster innovation, adaptation, and employee empowerment,\" adds Associate Professor Abayomi Baiyere.The paper was recently published in the Journal of Strategic Information Systems.Subtraction logicSubtraction logic as deinstitutionalisation refers to the process of removing established practices to make way for new ideas and approaches, enabling innovation and adaptation within an organization or society. It involves challenging traditional norms, rules, and behaviors to embrace change and new technologies.\"Subtraction in digital transformation requires careful consideration of which established practices need to be abandoned to achieve transformation goals. Organizations like the car company aiming for employee empowerment need to remove practices that oppose or undermine this notion, such as excessive managerial approvals,\" adds co-author Dr. Markus Zimmer from Leuphana University of Luneburg, Germany.The paper discusses how the car company rejected existing approval rules that caused delays in decision-making. Besides rejecting existing rules, the company also removed its business travel system, which enforced formal approval for trips. This change was viewed as a way to empower employees rather than restrict them. Initially, some managers resisted the change by insisting on approval via email, but the removal of the system helped establish new approval processes.Similarly, hierarchy had a significant impact on the allocation of IT equipment, which served as status symbols tied to one's position. However, the car company challenged this norm by eliminating permission rights to the IT ordering system. This change enabled employees to independently order IT equipment that aligned with their actual job needs, rather than their hierarchical position.Although some managers questioned how employees could afford expensive smartphones, the new IT ordering system empowered employees to embrace the revised rules and push the boundaries\"These conflicts occur because some individuals are reluctant to let go of privileges and control associated with the old practices,\" adds Zimmer.The research advocates for embracing the dual process of adding new elements while simultaneously subtracting unwanted ones and urges organizations to contemplate not only their desired future but also the aspects they wish to leave behind from the past.\"Our hope is that organizations use our research to approach digital workplace transformation not only by incorporating new practices and new technologies but also by eliminating those that impede their transformation goals. Taking such a balanced view may help managers avoid frustrations caused by the dominant 'addition narrative' logic,\" concludes Baiyere.

  "text": "What is the impact of affirmative actions, such as quota systems, on minorities' representation in top ranks of the academic and corporate worlds? Scientists used mathematical models for the first time to quantify how successful quota systems can be for improving women's visibility in science.          Their findings were published in the latest edition of the journal Communications Physics.\"The main question we wanted to answer was: the number of women has increased in academia and in the corporate sector over the past 100 years, but why do they not reach the top positions in their network?\" points out Fariba Karimi, a scientist at the Complexity Science Hub and co-author of the paper.According to the study, quotas alone are not sufficient to make minorities more visible in a network. \"In essence, the results show that having even extreme quotas does not necessarily ensure that minorities will be represented in top ranks of the network as we would expect from their size,\" says Karimi.\"In contrast, a very moderate quota would be extremely useful when it is combined with an inclusive environment in which people, especially those in high power positions, are open to bringing minorities into their personal networks,\" adds Karimi. \"By doing so, they are basically helping minorities grow their social capital through those connections.\"Hypothetical scenariosIn the study, the researchers created a network growth model to analyze how successful interventions can be for improving minorities' visibility in social networks. Two kinds of interventions were tested: group size interventions, such as quotas; and behavioral interventions, such as changing the way groups interact.\"We ran this two hypothetical scenarios, sometimes isolated, sometimes combined, as we wanted to evaluate which combination of interventions would be more effective in pushing minorities to the top of the ranking,\" explains Karimi.The model took into account two key social processes. First, the formation of structural inequalities that emerge within social networks due to certain preexisting societal biases, such as in-group favoritism or homophily\u2014the notion that humans tend to preferentially interact and connect with individuals who are like them in some way. Second, the impact of different interventions on changing those initial structural inequalities.The results show, for instance, that even a very strong group size intervention\u2014to have a 90 percent quota\u2014will not improve minorities' representation in the top ranks to a level proportional to their total size if the initial configuration is strongly homophilic. As a result of historical and cumulative structural inequality, minorities are locked in their initial network position.      Multidimensional \"The study shows that the discussion [of improving minorities' visibility] should not be one-dimensional\", highlights Leonie Neuh\u00e4user, from RWTH Aachen University and co-author of the study.From a network perspective, increasing the size of a group does not necessarily increase the visibility of minorities, according to Leonie Neuh\u00e4user, from RWTH Aachen University and co-author of the study. \"Obviously, this is a necessary step, but we should also consider the social network structure and behavioral aspects when designing interventions.\"The results indicate some behavioral interventions that may affect minority representation in top ranks. A minority group could benefit from increasing networking if they are large enough to gain a cumulative advantage in a growing social network. Alternatively, if quotas are not large enough, the majority group should be encouraged to mix with the minority group, since the latter will not gain visibility without connecting to the former.Hard to changeDespite the difficulty of changing behavior, Karimi emphasizes that increasing diversity depends on it. Leaders and top-level professionals can be educated about this issue and be inclusive when bringing people with diverse backgrounds into important positions on social networks, according to Karimi.\"We also need some regulation,\" adds Karimi. \"As humans, we have a tendency to prefer interacting with people who are similar to ourselves, since it is less cognitively demanding\u2014the homophily principle. Evolutionarily speaking, we are rewired to avoid interacting with outgroup members and that is why incentivizing and educating people about the benefits of diversity can help overcome those barriers.\"\"Due to the external regulations, after a certain number of minority people are incorporated into the system, things begin to change. Having more people of diverse backgrounds around us reduces our fear of strangeness. As a result, behavior would follow.\" More information:Leonie Neuh\u00e4user et al, Improving the visibility of minorities through network growth interventions, Communications Physics (2023).

  "question_squad": " What did Chan find about employees' efforts?",
  "answer_squad": " workers work harder before a hiring decision",
  "text": "When a new role opens up at a company, managers often face a choice: Promote an employee from within or bring an external candidate on board.          Employees may worry that a more qualified outside candidate will get the job. But new research from Texas McCombs finds that internal candidates are more likely to be promoted if they fulfill one condition: Work harder.The research is published in the Journal of Accounting Research.Assistant Accounting Professor Eric Chan found that before a hiring decision, employees will exert more effort to increase their chances of promotion\u2014especially right before the decision. Managers are more likely to promote them than to hire highly skilled external candidates.\"It's this idea of gift exchange,\" says Chan. \"We find that workers work harder before the hiring decision as they try to influence the manager in their favor. In exchange, the manager rewards them with a promotion.\"Their extra exertions endure, the study found, even after a promotion has gone through, and the worker gets no short-term economic benefits from continuing to put in more effort.The reason is to thank the manager for the opportunity through their actions, Chan says. \"This gift exchange continues.\"Higher effort before hiringTo study what drives managers' decisions and employees' behavior around filling job openings, Chan ran an experiment in collaboration with Jeremy Lill of the University of Kansas and Victor Maas of the University of Amsterdam.They recruited 138 business school students to play the parts of managers and employees during six work periods: three before a hiring decision and three after. For each period, employees earned a fixed wage in points that was converted into actual money at the end of the experiment.For every period, employees chose what level of extra effort to put in, from 0% to 100%. That effort in practice can represent working overtime, taking on additional projects, or voluntarily helping colleagues.Raising their efforts more than 20% would cost them points\u2014but might boost their chances of promotion. Any extra effort benefits the managers by increasing their profit points. At the end of each period, a manager learned the amounts of employees' efforts.After three periods, the manager decided whether to promote or hire from outside. The study found a strong correlation between effort and promotion:Overall employee efforts increased up to 51%, peaking right before a hiring decision.Managers promoted employees internally 54% of the time.Average effort was 18% higher for employees who got promoted.Even after a promotion decision was made, employees' effort levels declined only 8%.When the researchers introduced statistical noise to make employees' effort levels harder to pinpoint, managers were still 26% more likely to hire internally.\"Managers see employees' past effort as a gift that should be reciprocated,\" Chan says.      Gifts that keep givingWould different methods for measuring employee performance affect managers' decisions? To find out, the researchers tested two systems. Some managers learned employees' precise effort levels. For others, statistical noise got added, making efforts harder to pinpoint.Managers were more likely to promote internally when measurements were less precise, the researchers found: by a margin of 26%.\"When managers don't quite know if workers gave high effort or low effort, they give workers the benefit of the doubt,\" Chan says. \"'Let me promote you anyway to show my trust in you.'\"Even after a promotion decision was made, he found employees continued putting in extra efforts. Their levels declined only 8%.That indicates that managers reap some benefits from promoting internally, he adds. \"The employee continues to work hard, so the manager gets a little extra that way.\"The 'black box' of hiring decisionsThe research has implications for employees and managers alike. For workers who hope to get promoted, \"it's useful to understand how firms and their managers make promotion and hire decisions,\" Chan says.Managers should be aware of their biases toward promoting employees when they're choosing between an internal candidate and an external one, he cautions.\"In the case of a system that captures employees' effort imprecisely, you might be promoting someone who may not be as hardworking as you assume, and they therefore may not fit that higher-level role as well,\" says Chan.On the positive side, managers can rest assured that if they do promote hardworking employees, the employees won't dial down their efforts afterward.Such research can help both sides understand what drives managers' promotion and hiring decisions and how employees react to them, Chan says.\"Managers can be reluctant to be transparent about their promotion criteria, to retain control and discretion over the decision,\" he says. \"For many employees, the criteria for promotion remain a black box. But further research can help us peer inside.\" More information:Eric W. Chan et al, Promote Internally or Hire Externally?

  "answer_squad": " The impact of commission bans on household wealth: Findings from OECD countries",
  "text": "As part of the study titled \"The impact of commission bans on household wealth: Findings from OECD countries,\" a team led by Professor Steffen Sebastian, Director at the Center for Finance at the University of Regensburg, investigated the impact of commission bans on the brokerage of financial investments.          The results are clear: household wealth in countries with commission bans grows significantly more than in countries without commission bans. The research team measured the difference in returns at 1.7 percent p. a. The study attracted widespread interest in both the political sphere and in the media\u2014while at the same time, attracting strong criticism from the financial sector.In an update of the study, the researchers now have estimated the financial loss for all affected countries in the EU for the first time. \"Europe-wide, the damage amounts to 375 billion euros. For Germany alone, this is 98 billion euros\u2014year after year. This corresponds to a loss of about 2,400 euros per household per year,\" says Professor Sebastian.In addition, the criticism that people would save less due to a commission ban was investigated. \"According to our calculations, there is no significant influence of a commission ban on the savings rate of households. Based on the available data, the claim that less would be saved due to a commission ban, is completely unsubstantiated,\" Sebastian confirms.Denmark, Finland, the UK, the Netherlands, Norway as well as Australia and New Zealand have introduced commission bans at various points in the recent past, between 2005 (Finland) and 2019 (Australia). In these countries, alternative payment methods (e.g. according to advisory time or assets under management) have become well established, thanks to regulation.The EU Commission wants to limit the harmful effects of commission-based sales of financial products, primarily through various transparency regulations.However, relying on improving transparency alone is ineffective, as the example of the Netherlands shows: 13 failed amendments to the transparency regulations for financial advice made the legislator realize in the end, that there is no way around a commission ban. \"It is regrettable that we in Europe apparently also have to go the Dutch route. It will cost consumers a fortune,\" Sebastian states.In principle, the national legislators can also impose a commission ban on their own. However, this seems unlikely due to resistance on the part of many national governments. The researchers from Regensburg are now pinning their hopes on parliament, because the retail investor strategy still has to be confirmed by parliament and the European Council.

  "question_squad": " What was the name of the urn that contained the perfume?",
  "answer_squad": " cinerary",
  "text": "A research team at the University of Cordoba has identified, for the first time, the composition of a Roman perfume more than 2,000 years old thanks to the discovery of a small vessel of ointment in Carmona.          Two thousand years ago, in the Roman city of Carmo (today's Carmona), in the province of Seville, someone placed a vessel of ointment in a funerary urn. Twenty centuries later, the FQM346 research team at the University of Cordoba, led by Professor of Organic Chemistry Jos\u00e9 Rafael Ruiz Arrebola, in collaboration with the City of Carmona, has been able to chemically describe the components of a perfume dating from the first century AD.The results were published in the journal Heritage in an article in which Ruiz Arrebola; the municipal archaeologist of Carmona, Juan Manuel Rom\u00e1n; and UCO researchers Daniel Cosano and Fernando Lafont share the whole technical and scientific process enabling the world to \"smell\" the bygone Roman Empire.The residue of the perfume, discovered in 2019 during an archaeological intervention in a mausoleum found during construction of a house on the Calle Sevillat, had been preserved, solidified, inside a vessel carved in quartz, which was still perfectly sealed. As Rom\u00e1n explains, it was a collective tomb, possibly belonging to an affluent family, and in which, in addition to numerous objects related to funeral rituals (offerings and trousseaus), the cinerary urns of six adult individuals\u2014three women and three men\u2014were found.In one of the urns, made of glass, over the cremated skeletal remains of the deceased (in this case, a woman between 30 and 40 years old), a cloth bag had been placed (the remains of it having been preserved). It contained three amber beads and a small rock crystal (hyaline quartz) flask, carved in the shape of an amphora, containing ointment.Perfume containers used to be made of blown glass, and on very rare occasions, examples made of this material have been found. Their characteristics, difficult carving, and hardness made them very valuable and extremely expensive. In addition to the uniqueness of the receptacle, the truly extraordinary aspect of the find was that it was perfectly sealed, and that the solid residues of the perfume had been preserved inside, which made it possible to carry out this study.Ruiz Arrebola stresses that the use of dolomite (a type of carbon) as a stopper, and the bitumen used to seal it, were the key to the magnificent state of preservation of the piece and its contents.To ascertain what the perfume was made of, different instrumental techniques were used, such as X-ray diffraction and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, among others. According to Ruiz, from the analyses it has been possible to determine that the small cylindrical stopper was made of dolomite (limestone), and that bitumen was used for its perfect fit and airtight seal.With respect to the perfume, two components have been identified: a base or binder, which allowed for the preservation of the aromas, and the essence itself; these findings according with descriptions by none other than Pliny the Elder. In this case, the base was a vegetable oil; possibly\u2014according to some indications reflected in the analysis\u2014olive oil, although this point could not be confirmed with certainty.And the essence?According to the results of chemical analyses carried out by the University of Cordoba, Rome smelled of patchouli, an essential oil obtained from a plant of Indian origin, Pogostemon cablin, widely used in modern perfumery, and whose use in Roman times was not known. The monumental characteristics of the tomb where it was found, and above all, the material of which the vessel containing it was made, suggest that it was a highly valuable product.This study constitutes a breakthrough in the field of Roman perfumery, as regards the use of patchouli as an essential oil. Further studies are currently being carried out on other unique materials (such as amber, fabrics, and pigments used in the wall paintings) preserved in the Carmona mausoleum. Results are expected soon. More information:Daniel Cosano et al, Archaeometric Identification of a Perfume from Roman Times, Heritage (2023).

  "text": "A study by the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) makes a new technological appraisal of a northern gannet bone that displays complex peri-cylindrical decoration          A study by the UPV/EHU offers a new appraisal of a decorated ulna from a northern gannet found in 1966 during the exploration of the Torre cave archaeological site in Gipuzkoa. The new technological and stylistic analysis provides greater precision of the engravings on one of the few remains with peri-cylindrical decoration on the Iberian Peninsula that displays a complex combination of motifs; it also reveals some previously undetected ones.The article \"Revaluation of the Portable Art of Northern Iberia: a Magdalenian Decorated Bone Tube from Torre,\" has just published in the Journal of Paleolithic Archaeology. The lead author is Asier Erostarbe-Tome, a Ph.D. student in the UPV/EHU's Department of Geography, Prehistory and Archaeology. A study offers a fresh appraisal of a decorated ulna from a northern gannet (Morus bassanus) found in 1966 during the exploration of the Torre cave archaeological site in Gipuzkoa.Unlike what has been done so far in the bone industry in which typological studies prevailed, technological studies allow the operational chain to be reconstituted, i.e., from the time the hunter-gatherers acquired the raw material, its transformation, to its repair or discarding. In this way, sense is made of the series of materials studied in order to gain a better understanding of the technocomplex that marked the end of the Upper Paleolithic and, in turn, to open up new avenues of research in this field.\"In the case of the Torre tube, given the exceptional nature of the piece, I thought it was important to make it known by re-appraising the object from a technological point of view, as it is currently one of the most complete specimens from the entire Iberian Peninsula,\" says Asier Erostarbe. Objects of this type, i.e., tubes, mainly appear from the Solutrean period onwards on the Iberian Peninsula, although most of them belong to the Magdalenian, just like the Torre tube.                Tracing of the engraving of the tube indicating the number of graphs. Credit: Journal of Paleolithic Archaeology (2023). DOI: 10.1007/s41982-023-00143-1             The piece is one of the few objects of portable art with a peri-cylindrical decoration featuring a complex combination of motifs. It is profusely decorated with figurative representations (deer, horse, ibex, chamois, auroch and an anthropomorph) and signs (simple lines, parallel lines, zigzags, etc.) arranged in two bands oriented in the opposite direction. Furthermore, when compared with the fauna consumed by human groups at that time, it can be seen that not only favorite game animals (such as deer or mountain goat) were engraved on the tube, but also animals that were consumed less frequently (horse, auroch or chamois).      \"With the new technology available, our study has made it possible to achieve greater precision in the engravings, as well as to discover some hitherto undetected ones. The depictions follow a similar pattern in all cases. The outlines of the figures and signs were firstly traced, and a lithic tool was used several times to make deep grooves. Decorations consisting of short lines and/or notches were made later, and it is sometimes seen that the bone was turned over to make them. The artist possessed great cognitive ability, an aesthetic appreciation of visual regularity and a lateralization of motor functions.\"Furthermore, by analyzing the engravings, we have observed similarities in the process, especially of the engraved animals, with other Magdalenian sites on the Cantabrian Coast and in the Pyrenees, which corroborates exchanges of technical and iconographic behavior,\" says the researcher.The functionality of these objects remains a matter for debate, since various functionalities have been attributed to them: airbrushes, whistles, needle containers, beads in the process of being made, ochre containers, ritual objects, etc. As there are only a small number of specimens in the world, it is very difficult to attribute a single function to them and they may have served as multifunctional objects.\"In our study of the tube we have not detected any evidence of its purpose, and the traceological analyses have not been able to go any further in that direction. So, the true function of the Torre tube for the hunter-gatherers who inhabited the cave remains an enigma,\" he concludes.

  "question_squad": " What is the term for interruptions that do not allow for idle time?",
  "answer_squad": " surprises",
  "text": "Interruptions are an inevitable part of working life. Some last a short time\u2014a phone call, an urgent task, or a colleague stopping by for a chat. While these can take a brief toll on productivity, extended interruptions such as supply-chain issues, extreme weather or machinery breakdowns, can have a more significant impact. But what if there were a silver lining?          In our research at the Hamburg University of Technology, we were curious to explore how different types of disruptions can influence employees' creative performance and how one can even harness them to boost innovation at work.Differentiating interruptionsNot all interruptions are the same and they can be broadly differentiated based on two characteristics: whether they allow for idle time or not, and whether they are unexpected or not. We can therefore distinguish three types of extended interruptions:Surprises are unexpected interruptions that release idle time and allow employees' minds to wander. A supply-chain disruption leading to a temporary halt in production might qualify as one, for example, or a power outage that requires a pause until electricity is restored. A critical software system going down could also be considered a surprise, as they prevent employees from completing their daily tasks.Intrusions are unexpected interruptions that do not come with idle time. They typically require employees to switch their attention to the new, pressing issue. These can negatively impact creativity, as employees' focus is diverted away from their original tasks. Examples of intrusions include urgent client requests, where a high-priority client suddenly requires immediate assistance to resolve an issue with their order or service. Employees must pause their tasks and address the client's concerns promptly. Another example is an emergency meeting in response to a sudden crisis.Planned breaks represent expected interruptions with idle time. They are scheduled and deliberate, allowing employees to step away from their work and focus on personal activities or goals and play a crucial role in employee well-being and work-life balance. Examples of planned breaks include vacations, public holidays or company-wide breaks.The impact of different interruptions on creativity By examining the effects of these interruptions on employees' performance, we can identify which ones have the potential to boost innovation and how organizations can best manage them.Conducted at a manufacturer in the automotive industry, our research investigates the creative outputs of employees during various interruptions. We used natural experiments, exploiting events such as supply-chain shortages, extreme weather events, and school breaks to explore how different types of interruptions impact creative performance.Our findings suggest that surprises with idle time can significantly increase employees' creative performance, understood here as the number and quality of ideas they put forward to improve their firm's products and services. We found that individuals exposed to such interruptions generated 58% more ideas than their uninterrupted peers in the three weeks following the disruption. This boost in creativity is attributed to continued thinking about work and maintaining work goals during the interruption, which enables idea incubation.In contrast, intrusions harm creativity. When employees are forced to switch their attention to the incoming task, their attention residue\u2014or the amount of attention that lingers on the interrupted task\u2014drops, reducing their creative performance.As for planned breaks, such as vacations or school holidays, we found that they do not positively affect creative performance. During these expected interruptions, employees tend to disengage from work and focus on non-work-related goals, which lowers attention residue and hinders idea incubation. This comes nevertheless with the important caveat that breaks remain essential for employee well-being and rejuvenation.But why is it that some interruptions are conducive to creative performance while others are not? One answer may lie in attention residue theory, which posits that some attention lingers on an interrupted task even after the individual has shifted focus elsewhere. This lingering attention can help ideas incubate and foster creative thinking. With extended interruptions, the amount of attention residue depends on whether the interruption allows for idle time and whether it is unexpected or not.During surprises, employees have idle time to think about their work and keep their work goals active, which results in higher attention residue and increased creative performance. In contrast, during intrusions, attention residue is reduced as employees must focus on the incoming task. Similarly, during planned breaks, attention residue decreases as employees disengage from work and concentrate on non-work goals.The art of interruption: a rulebook The good news is that it is possible for organizations to stir up creativity by applying a series of guidelines:Surprises: When unforeseen events free up time, organizations can encourage employees to use it to reflect on their work and generate new ideas. One way for management to go about this is provide tools and resources that encourage idle pondering, such as access to idea submission systems, brainstorming sessions after the interruption, or quiet spaces for contemplation.Intrusions: Management ought to establish clear priorities and minimize distractions during an intrusion to enable employees to concentrate on the task at hand. Before attending to an intrusion, ready-to-resume plans in which one notes where work has been left off help to resume the original task. Once the interruption ends, support re-engagement with original work by having people reflect how they will resume the original task or promoting collaboration and communication among colleagues.Planned breaks: Organizations should encourage employees to disconnect from work during vacations and other scheduled breaks to recharge and maintain a healthy work-life balance. Upon returning from a break, create opportunities for employees to share their experiences, insights, or inspirations, potentially sparking new ideas or fostering a creative mindset.Extended interruptions are an unavoidable part of working life. However, by understanding their impact on creativity and implementing strategies to leverage their potential, one can transform these disruptions into rich opportunities. By embracing surprises, managing attention during intrusions, and encouraging deliberate disconnection during planned breaks, organizations can unleash the creative potential of their employees and foster a more innovative work environment.

  "text": "The toughest sell in business isn't a sell at all, strictly speaking. Convincing others to donate valuable time or resources to your cause, without any tangible compensation, is the rarest and most prized of communications skills. That is especially true in our age of digital mass communication, when written appeals jostle for attention in our email inboxes and social-media feeds every day.          For those few who have mastered it, the art of successful solicitation can come in handy in myriad professional contexts\u2013from crowdsourcing and crowdfunding campaigns to recruiting volunteers for undesirable tasks.Jiyeon Hong, assistant professor of marketing at George Mason University School of Business, recently published a paper in Marketing Science (co-authored by Paul R. Hoban of Amazon) shedding light on why soliciting uncompensated help is so difficult for most of us. These solicitations may flout one of the most well-known rules of business writing: namely, \"keep it simple stupid\" (KISS).The assumption behind \"KISS\" is that readers respond most strongly to lean prose that makes minimal mental demands. But Hong's research, including algorithmic analysis and a randomized controlled trial (RCT), suggests that simple, punchy writing is not always the most convincing for donors.Hong's algorithm builds upon the hierarchical attention network (HAN) model, a deep learning methodology that classifies documents by identifying their most salient features and mapping them to predetermined categories. \"Hierarchical attention allows us to see which words and sentences are most detrimental and beneficial to success,\" Hong says.To train and test the algorithm, the researchers used data from DonorsChoose, a crowdfunding platform for public school teachers seeking support for classroom projects.After training with more than 60,000 DonorsChoose projects from the period 2009-2017, the algorithm identified which sentences within the DonorsChoose proposals were the most pivotal to the outcome (i.e. getting funded or not). The effectiveness of the algorithm was then verified in an RCT, in which teachers revised the essays\u2013half the teachers were given the algorithm's recommendations, and half were not\u2013and a group of undergraduates rated the revised work.Overall, the essays revised with the help of the algorithm were judged 4.5 percent more likely to be funded, a difference can be translated into additional funding of nearly $10 million.      Sentences classified as \"beneficial\" and \"detrimental\" to success by the algorithm exhibited a consistent pattern of characteristics.\"More concrete and specific content tended to be in the beneficial sentences,\" Hong says. \"Acronyms and insider terms also appeared often in the more persuasive sentences.\" In direct opposition to the \"KISS\" rule, beneficial sentences were slightly longer and demanded more of the reader. Their average readability score was 9.51, compared to 8.72 for detrimental sentences. (Readability scores correspond to the grade level required to understand the sentence.)For example, instead of describing diversity in vague language such as \"Our school has a very diverse student population,\" a beneficial sentence would be densely packed with detail\u2014e.g. \"Our school is a Title 1 school serving a diverse and vibrant student population: 80 percent are students of color and nearly half are English Language Learners.\"These findings added supplemental insights to official writer's guidance on the DonorsChoose website, which stressed \"Don't use jargon,\" \"Tell a story\" and \"Let your students shine\". While steering clear of jargon may be a good rule of thumb, the algorithm identified exceptions to this rule\u2013i.e. when use of jargon would strengthen a rational argument for help or funding. Similarly, storytelling and examples of student accomplishments should include specific details that pinpoint relevance and value.Hong explains, \"The readers are in cognitive mindset, trying to compare many options because they also have a limited budget. In this context, objectively delivering information can be more persuasive. Facts win out over emotions.\"Her explanations piggyback upon past research, such as a salient study from 2008 showing that in contexts demanding rational thought rather than emotional response, communicators should use language that appeals to the head, not the heart.Hong also references a 1984 study that identified a direct relationship between the number of arguments in a message and its persuasiveness. Additionally, a 2011 paper explored how conditions that force us to work harder to retain information can aid long-term learning, a phenomenon the authors termed \"desirable difficulties\". Both studies point to scenarios where a more complex written presentation may sink in better than simple, easily digestible language.\"We conclude that the most successful appeals for help will not be those that make the simplest and tightest arguments. Instead, they will a) expose the reader to a modest amount of desirable difficulty; and b) put forth a detailed case that is low on emotional coloration,\" Hong says.

  "text": "Thousands of state-sponsored propaganda tweets on the Iranian nuclear deal have been analyzed using artificial intelligence by experts at the University of Portsmouth.          The findings show that natural language processing and machine learning tools can help analyze large-scale data and give insight into Iranian social media strategy.Computing experts started with an initial dataset of over nine million tweets from nearly 6,000 accounts in 67 languages, which Twitter had identified as being linked to the Iranian state.They filtered this dataset by language, date and key term, leaving over 24,000 tweets, which were then analyzed for their sentiment and objectivity. Sentiment analysis is used to gauge opinions on a topic and determine emotional tone.Lead author, Michael Barrows, who worked on the research while at the University of Portsmouth, said, \"We found that the tweets had high objectivity scores, particularly for tweets labeled as sentimentally neutral. This supports the argument that Iran could be imitating legitimate news outlets in order to provide credibility to their propaganda view points. Given that social media platforms are opening their verification programs to paying customers, the potential for influencing the discourse around various topics using objective language is significant.\"The research investigated the potential to automatically label and detect whether tweets were positive, neutral or negative, using five machine learning algorithms.Dr. Ella Haig, Reader in Artificial Intelligence from the University's School of Computing, said, \"The number of people obtaining news updates through social media has increased, which means it's being used to push narratives and propaganda that can influence discourse around various topics. Misinformation is a growing concern and it is increasingly difficult for users to differentiate between false and true information.\"\"There is a need for approaches that use automatic processes to support the detection and analysis of misinformation. Twitter might not be the 'real world', but it is nonetheless a significant phenomenon because of its out-sized influence on world events.\"      Iran's nuclear program has been one of the most significant security issues on the international stage for the past two decades, but this is the first time Iran's online information related to the nuclear deal has been studied.The data was filtered by language to ensure all tweets retained were in English. English-language tweets were deemed significant because they are likely aimed at an international audience, particularly citizens and elites in countries involved in the negotiation of the nuclear deal.They were then filtered by date, so all tweets published between August 2013 and December 2018. These dates were chosen because Iranian President Rouhani was inaugurated in August 2013 and former US President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Iran nuclear agreement in May 2018.The tweets were finally filtered by key terms such as 'JCPOA', 'irandeal7', 'nuclear talks' and 'negotiation'.Dr. Haig said, \"The study found that the dataset contained a similar number of positive and negative tweets, which raises questions around whether this was a deliberate information operation. There could be parallels with Russia's strategy of sowing confusion by swamping Twitter with tweets, rather than overtly sharing messages for or against the nuclear deal.\"\"The aim of this research was to facilitate the analysis of state-sponsored propaganda tweets in an (semi-)automatic manner and obtain insights that would not be possible otherwise due to the large volume of data.\"The paper is published in IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems. It is co-authored by Michael Barrows, a former Masters of research student from the University of Portsmouth's School of Computing and Dr. Dara Conduit, a lecturer in political science, from the University of Melbourne.Dr. Conduit said, \"As a political scientist, this collaboration with computer science colleagues underlined why we need to work together to understand the problems the world faces today. The dataset is too large to have been meaningfully analyzed by humans alone, so the AI tools provided a key opportunity for us to understand how the Iranian regime was conveying messages about the nuclear deal online when it thought that no one was watching.\"The research team was able to access this dataset through Twitter's Election Integrity Project, which shared 'fake' accounts with a number of research teams that Twitter had identified as linked to state-based disinformation campaigns and subsequently deleted from the platform.Dr. Conduit added, \"This provided a rare opportunity to analyze state-based disinformation campaigns, because it is often very difficult to identify these kinds of accounts with any certainty because they are actively trying to be invisible. The Election Integrity Project helped us to get around this challenge by giving us access to known artifacts of state information operations.\" More information:Michael Barrows et al, Sentiment and Objectivity in Iranian State-Sponsored Propaganda on Twitter, IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems (2023).

  "text": "Social media superspreaders have the ability to rapidly disseminate information, regardless of its veracity. This means they can influence consequential conversations\u2014for better or worse\u2014related to elections, public health and social issues.          With the goal of tracking superspreaders that are disseminating large quantities of low-credibility content, Indiana University's Observatory on Social Media, or OSoMe, has launched a new tool: the Top FIBers dashboard.This dashboard provides monthly reports highlighting the top 10 superspreaders of low-credibility information on social media. Superspreaders are identified using a metric called the \"False Information Broadcaster index\" or \"FIB index,\" which captures the consistency with which users share links to low-credibility sources that are subsequently reshared many times.For example, a user with a FIB index of 100 has shared at least 100 posts linking to low-credibility sources, each of which has been reshared at least 100 times. On the other hand, a user who shares only one post linking to a low-credibility source will have a FIB index of one, even if it was reshared millions of times.\"Research from our observatory and others has shown that a few influencers are responsible for a large proportion of low-credibility content being shared online, including harmful content such as false vaccine claims,\" said Filippo Menczer, director of OSoMe and Luddy Distinguished Professor of Informatics and Computer Science. \"Our new dashboard will help citizens understand the role of these bad actors in the spread of misinformation.\"OSoMe uses a definition of misinformation commonly utilized in academic research, which focuses on sources of information that mimic news media content in form but not in organizational process or intent. Using this definition, the dashboard searches for posts that contain at least one link to any source that meets three criteria: rated to have low credibility; categorized as either \"conspiracy/pseudoscience\" or \"questionable/fake news\"; and labeled as having a low or very low factual score. These ratings are curated by an independent third party, Media Bias/Fact Check, and compiled by Iffy.news.Since a source's credibility rating can change, OSoMe updates its list of sources each month before releasing a new Top FIBers monthly report.The dashboard uses publicly available data gathered from social media platforms. Reports have been generated for all months beginning in January 2022 and will be updated each month moving forward.\"As the social media landscape evolves, OSoMe is constantly looking for new ways to partner with platforms on making data accessible to researchers,\" said Caitlin Watkins, OSoMe's executive director. \"This tool exemplifies the public good that comes from such data access.\" More information:Website: osome.iu.edu/tools/topfibers/Provided byIndiana UniversityCitation:Top FIBers dashboard tracks superspreaders of low-credibility information online (2023, May 25)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-fibers-dashboard-tracks-superspreaders-low-credibility.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "question_squad": " What did the interviewees feel the focus was on?",
  "answer_squad": " 'what could go wrong'",
  "text": "Last week, the Albanese government announced an expert panel to support relationships and sexuality education in Australian schools.          The group is lead by the head of anti-violence organization Our Watch, Patty Kinnersly, and includes consent advocate Chanel Contos. It will do a \"rapid review\" into consent and respectful relationships programs to identify \"opportunities for improvement.\"This follows a new focus on consent and healthy relationships in Australian schools. The former Coalition government made consent a mandatory part of the curriculum.We are talking to teenagers about the sex education they receive at schools. This research highlights several areas young people think can be improved. They are particularly concerned sex education most often does not discuss actual sex.Our research As part of broader, ongoing research into online sexual content, we interviewed 30 West Australian teens (aged 11-17), between 2021 and 2023, to explore their experiences of sex education and where they source information to answer their questions about sex and relationships.Eighteen interviewees were followed up with 12 months after we had first spoken, to see if their perspectives had changed.Interviews began as some schools started teaching consent in 2021, with sexual assault being widely debated in the wake of the women's March4Justice rallies around the country and a school sexual assault petition spearheaded by Contos. We have continued to gather young people's perspectives as consent education became mandatory at the start of this school year.Only the basics The majority of the young people interviewed told us they were only taught the basics about consent\u2014along the lines of \"no means no, and yes means yes.\" As interviewee Miles* (17) told us:\"It's always broadly talked about [\u2026] but it's never actually talked about what it means and what it actually is.\"Nicola (16) added:\"It was more just like if someone says 'no,\" 'stop' or things like that and if you don't like it say 'no' and things instead of the depths of it.\"Consent is complex, so teaching it without necessary detail or context can have devastating results. Some young people may feel unable to say \"no\" safely in unwanted sexual experiences, and others are genuinely unaware a sexual act occurring, may not be consensual.At the same time, teens also felt like the focus was on consent at the expense of other information and topics. As Tiffany (14) said,\"The whole thing is consent, 'cos that's such a big thing nowadays [\u2026] we haven't been taught about sex.\"      A focus on 'what could go wrong' Interviewees also felt current sex education was overwhelmingly fear-based and focused on safety. As 15-year-old Lauren explained, she and her classmates had been taught \"what could go wrong and not anything else.\"\"They talk more about sexual violence and sexual assault than they do about sex itself and the benefits of sex and pleasure [\u2026]. It makes it feel like it's bad to have sex and that there's no pleasure in it and it's harmful.\"The focus was on risk and biological aspects also left many students confused in terms of how to navigate real-life sexual scenarios safely. As Caris (15) explained:\"It's hard not knowing what to do and where to put yourself and how to move and all of that. It's hard for teenagers and they don't feel comfortable going to their parents.\"Warren (17) said this meant teenagers were going online to find more information.\"The lack of education causes the younger generation to resort to online personal education therefore resulting in more negative or destructive sexual encounters.\"This echoes a 2021\u201322 national survey, which found 95% of young Australians thought sex education was an important part of the curriculum. But only 24.8% said their most recent class was \"very\" or \"extremely\" relevant to them.Teachers don't seem trained Young people interviewed also felt like their educators did not have enough training to be teaching about relationships and sexuality, which is taught as part of health and physical education from the first year of school to Year 10. As Nicola said,\"It's strange they have sport teachers teaching it, it's not a designated teacher for that program. I think it makes a lot more sense if it's someone who actually is knowledgeable.\"Although a number of teens experienced enthusiastic, invigorating teachers, other interviewees wondered why an outside expert could not be brought in to teach about relationships and sexuality.What needs to change Consent education is extremely important. But if there is an overwhelming focus on consent and risks, education programs can create fear around sex. This can lead to trauma and shame. A Rebecca (16) told us:\"It was called healthy relationships, but I reckon should just be called consent 'cos that's pretty much all we did the whole term.\"Young people need be part of a culture that cares for and respect one another, rather than simply being taught to gain permission for sex. Young people need real-life strategies and communication techniques so they can talk about sex openly and clearly.There also needs to be balanced information with discussion about the positive aspects of sex, such as building intimacy, communicating and pleasure.This means consent education needs to be included as an important ingredient within a more comprehensive relationships and sexuality program.We also need to ensure teachers are supported and receive appropriate training, working alongside visiting specialists as needed.Learning about sex doesn't mean young people will have it There's a common misconception that discussing sex encourages young people to have sex earlier. However, research suggests the opposite and information can actually delay sexual activity. Recent research also shows Australian parents want schools to tackle sex and relationships in more detail and from an early age.Ultimately, schools need to be able to listen to the concerns of teens to meet their real needs around sex education in ways that are healthy, safe and relevant.

  "text": "Every day, hundreds of stone artifact enthusiasts around the world sit down and begin striking a stone with special tools attempting to craft the perfect arrowhead or knife. This craft is known as flintknapping, and for most, it is a skilled hobby or art form that was thought to occasionally require bandages or stitches.          However, new research suggests flintknapping is far more dangerous than previously understood. And for early humans who were without the modern conveniences of hospitals, antibiotics, treated water and band-aids, a more severe cut could get infected and be life-threatening.\"Knapping injuries were a risk past peoples were willing to take,\" said Metin I. Eren, Ph.D., associate professor and director of archaeology at Kent State University.Eren and his colleague Stephen Lycett, Ph.D., associate professor of anthropology at the University at Buffalo, both also flintknappers themselves, were curious about knapping injuries and risks. More than 10 years ago, they began discussing a study they wanted to conduct that involved surveying modern flintknappers and documenting their injuries systematically.\"We've known for a long while that flintknapping can result in injuries, but its never been quantitatively assessed on a widespread level,\" Eren said. \"What is the frequency of injury? How bad can flintknapping injuries get? For that sort of thing, you need a large sample size.\"They found Nicholas Gala, at the time a Kent State undergraduate anthropology major working in Kent State's Experimental Archaeology Lab, who was looking for a senior honors thesis project.Gala conducted the survey that led to his first authored article in North America's flagship archaeology research journal, American Antiquity. They received survey responses from 173 modern flintknappers who described their wide-ranging injuries. The article, \"The Injury Costs of Knapping,\" was also co-authored by Eren, Lycett and Michelle Bebber, Ph.D., assistant professor in the Department of Anthropology at Kent State.\"Nick's work on this project has been fantastic,\" Lycett said. \"Successfully coordinating a number of different project elements always requires considerable skill and organization. The number of parts in this project, from coming up with a questionnaire to reaching out to many flintknappers and then collating and thinking about all the data, was a difficult task.\"Flintknapping and injuriesFlintknapping is the method of breaking, flaking and shaping stone tools, such as points for arrow tips or sharp blades for an ax or knife. Archaeological evidence for knapping goes back more than 3 million years.                A color-coded figure illustrates that flintknapping injuries are not just limited to the hands. Credit: Kent State University             \"People like to say, 'You are going to cut yourself while learning to flint knap, even if you are an expert flintknapper,' so we wanted to know how dangerous it actually is,\" Gala said. \"What are the most severe injuries that people have? How can we relate that to past people?\"The researchers learned that knapping is far more dangerous than they previously imagined. Among some of the most severe injuries reported by flintknappers included running a flake across their bone like a wood planar, cuts deep into the periosteum of the bone, and the need for a tourniquet after piercing their ankle with a flake.Thirty-five people surveyed said they have had small stone flakes fly into one of their eyes. The researchers also shared a historical account of William Henry Holmes who disabled his entire left arm from flintknapping back in the late 1890s. Several grislier examples are reported in the open-access study.\"This study emphasizes how important stone tools would have been to past peoples,\" Eren said. \"They literally would have risked life and limb to make stone tools during a period without band-aids, antibiotics or hospitals. But despite those injury costs, past peoples made stone tools anyway\u2014the benefits provided must have been immense.\"\"What, to us, might seem a minor inconvenience, could in the past have proven fatal if the wound became infected and prevented an individual from effectively gathering food, water and undertaking other essential activities,\" Lycett said. \"For those taking care of small infants, not only would their life be in jeopardy, but the life of these infants would also be in the balance. The costs of injury in the ancient world were magnified. These are exactly the kinds of costs that evolutionary models will need to take account of, and our study is a step toward that.\"Bebber collaborated with Gala on how to best visualize and report his data and developed a color-coded figure, which illustrates that injuries are not just limited to the hands. Injury frequency varies, and there are injuries that occur on the entire body, including flintknappers' feet, legs and torso.\"The eye injuries are the most dangerous from my perspective, simply because they seem to be common and could result in loss of sight, which would significantly impact the life of the knapper,\" Bebber said. \"Stone tools were vital to their daily activities and overall survival. I think overall they were used to a more dangerous lifestyle and also would have had their own ways of treating injuries.\"      Social learningThe researchers were also interested in more accurately considering how injury risks might be incorporated into ongoing debates about the likelihood of ancient species (Homo erectus, Homo habilis) engaging in social learning (to teach and prevent injuries) when learning to make stone tools.\"Social learning involves directly copying the outcomes or actions of a more skilled individual rather than learning everything by yourself through trial and error,\" Lycett said. \"We know from studies of animals and humans that social learning, rather than learning individually, is more likely when there is an increased risk or cost to learning alone. The injury risks involved in knapping are exactly the kind of activity that would have made learning from a skilled individual more likely since it would help reduce the risks associated with individual learning.\"Stone tools are the best evidence we have to track social learning early in our evolution because they withstand the passage of time,\" Lycett continued. \"Other skills may have been socially learned deep in prehistory, but evidence for those behaviors is not so well preserved.\" More information:Nicholas Gala et al, The Injury Costs of Knapping, American Antiquity (2023).

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What percentage of Americans 65 and older have cognitive impairment?",
  "answer_squad": " Nearly 20%",
  "text": "America is getting older. By 2050, one-fifth of the U.S. population is projected to be over the age of 65. And the way we're aging is changing, too. Older people today are more responsible for managing their finances than they were in the past.          Yet there's no escaping an uncomfortable fact of old age: Nearly 20% of Americans 65 or older have cognitive impairment, and nearly 10% have dementia.The intersection of these demographic, financial, and health care trends raises difficult questions about how older people should balance their desire to manage their own money with the possibility of cognitive decline. Do they have someone who can step in to help them if necessary? And will they recognize that they need help before making a costly mistake or getting ripped off?New research by Christopher Tonetti, an associate professor of economics at Stanford Graduate School of Business, finds that older investors are acutely aware of this challenge. \"People are very concerned about their future self not handing over financial control when they should,\" he says.Preparing for the handoffWorking with John Ameriks of Vanguard and three other academics\u2014Andrew Caplin of New York University, Minjoon Lee of Carleton University, and Matthew Shapiro of the University of Michigan\u2014Tonetti surveyed roughly 2,500 Vanguard clients 55 and older on how they've prepared to manage their finances into the future. (The participants were wealthier and more educated than a representative sample of older Americans, and likely savvier with their money.)Overall, the respondents had a pretty realistic sense of their likelihood of experiencing cognitive decline. (On average, they put their chances of having cognitive decline for at least five years at 29%; the actual number is 34%.) Most said they already had a family member or friend waiting in the wings who could take control of managing their money. \"A lot of people came back saying they had someone available who they trusted would do a good job,\" Tonetti says. \"That was a bit of a surprise.\"Anticipating the timing of this potential handoff, however, is not easy. Understandably, many people do not want to bring in an outside financial agent too soon, sacrificing their ability to make decisions for themselves. Nearly 84% of survey respondents said they would not want to give up financial control at the onset of cognitive decline, preferring to wait for a moment before they would completely lose the ability to manage their own money. Yet many respondents also realized they might delay transferring control of their finances because they would not recognize their own cognitive decline.\"Most people were concerned that they would hold on to control longer than they should and, by doing this, increase the chance that they would make a big mistake with their finances,\" Tonetti says. If they were suffering cognitive decline and it got too far along, \"they might make poor investment decisions or be more subject to scams and fraud.\"The researchers probed how much people would be willing to pay to optimize the timing of this handover. Importantly, Tonetti says, the survey didn't ask this hypothetical question directly, as people would have difficulty answering it. Rather, the survey design made it possible to analytically deduce the figure. The researchers found that one-quarter of the respondents were willing to pay more than $50,000 to ensure a transfer at the right time. Roughly 15% were willing to pay more than $100,000.Considering the risks, why don't older people transfer the management of their finances sooner? That they don't illuminates a key insight from this research: People want to maintain control of their own finances for as long as possible. What drives this desire, Tonetti says, is not clear. It could be a belief that they'll do a better job than their surrogates. They may enjoy the process, or perhaps they don't want to be a burden to others. Whatever their motivation, \"there is this desire to control their finances when capable,\" Tonetti says. \"That wasn't obvious before we wrote this paper.\"      Timing Is everythingAnother key insight is that people have limited awareness of their mental health. The onset of cognitive decline is often slow, and its symptoms can be difficult to recognize. However, people with significantly impaired cognition may be unwilling to hand over the reins of their finances.\"Given people have this limited awareness of their mental health, a desire to stay in control of their finances, and, importantly, a desire to pass control when decline sets in, we ought to have ways to help them understand where they are in terms of decline,\" Tonetti says.He suggests three ways to make it easier for older people to prepare for a financial handoff. First, doctors could offer regular screenings that indicate a person's competence in managing their finances. Second, people could have early conversations with their trusted financial agents (often their children) to plan what a transfer of control would look like and what might trigger it. \"This would be guidance\u2014not so much on what to do, but on when to take over,\" Tonetti says.Finally, financial institutions could design tests or procedures, either automated or conducted by employees, that screen customers for early signs of cognitive decline. If symptoms are detected, then a plan would be in place to contact the client's fiduciary.\"Whatever the method, this is a service that people could clearly use,\" Tonetti says. \"Our research points not just toward the elderly finding people who can help them manage their finances late in life, but also toward the importance of getting this help at the right time\u2014an ever more urgent need as the population of retirees grows.\"The paper is published in the journal American Economic Review: Insights.

The University's Dr. Sarah Reel led on an assessment of a system called TreadMatch for Yorkshire and the Humber Regional Scientific Support Services (YatH RSSS), based in nearby Wakefield. Currently TreadMatch takes digital scans from the footwear of persons detained in custody. The National Footwear Database (NFD) auto codes the scans and provides intelligence relating to crimes in the area where similar footwear patterns have been recovered.However, footwear experts at YatH RSSS saw potential for this system to be further exploited, with the digital scans being used for preliminary comparison against crime scene marks.Dr. Reel, along with a Master's student from Huddersfield, carried out a series of repeatability tests on data collected by footwear experts at YatH RSSS. They assessed how accurately TreadMatch was replicating the size of the digital TreadMatch scans, with the results now collated in a paper published in Science & Justice.\"Footwear had been placed on the TreadMatch scanner in a variety of ways by footwear experts at RSSS, both with someone's foot in the shoe or by rolling the shoe by hand to take a print,\" says Dr. Reel.\"The usual way of taking a print from a suspect's shoe for comparison with a crime scene footwear mark involves seizing the detainee's shoes and submitting them to the laboratory for comparison. This process can delay a comparison while a person is in custody. If the digital scans taken on TreadMatch accurately depict the shoe's tread, they could be used in real-time preliminary comparisons against the crime scene mark, potentially saving Police Officer time and resources.Dr. Reel's repeatability tests used a large sample of different sizes and makes of shoes, to figure out whether the TreadMatch scanner was replicating the size, width and length of the outsole shoe pattern.\"The results showed they were repeatable,\" she adds. \"It did not matter what size the shoe was, it came out as reliable, but we did find that the hand-rolled method was not as accurate as the walk-on one. It was not picking up the print very well, and it's important to get all the characteristics of the outsole pattern right to the edge of a shoe.\"The next stage of the research will be to investigate the accuracy of the comparison of digital TreadMatch scans with the crime scene marks, compared with the manual method currently used.Ryan Harris, Footwear Expert at YatH RSSS said, \"TreadMatch has the potential to save time and resources by facilitating forensic comparisons that would otherwise not have taken place due to time constraints. This will be particularly beneficial to police forces who use a regional scientific service, where the custody suites are significant distances from the forensic provider.\" More information:Sarah Reel et al, The application of TreadMatch scans to aid the process of footwear mark comparison, Science & Justice (2022).

  "question_squad": " What is the average life expectancy for people born in New York and California?",
  "answer_squad": " 77.7",
  "text": "The United States is an increasingly polarized country when it comes to politics\u2014but one thing that almost all people want is to live a long, healthy life.          More and more Americans are moving from Democratic-leaning blue states to Republican-voting red ones, and one of the effects of this change is that they are relocating to places with lower life expectancy.Idaho, Montana and Florida, all red states, had the greatest population growth among U.S. states between 2020 and 2022. Meanwhile, New York and Illinois, both blue states, and Louisiana, a red state, suffered the biggest population losses. California, another blue state, has experienced significant recent population loss as well.One key reason for this migration is the high cost of living in places like New York and California, compared with the lower cost of living in red states such as Georgia or Indiana.I am a scholar who studies the intersection between politics, media and psychology. I think it is important to note that another trend, though, is that people are largely migrating to places with lower life expectancies.Understanding demographicsThere is a large difference in expected life spans for people living in certain states, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.For instance, people born in New York and California\u2014two of the richest states in the country, which largely vote Democratic\u2014have a life expectancy of 77.7 and 79 years, respectively. But people in Mississippi and Louisiana\u2014two of the poorest states, which tend to vote Republican\u2014live, on average, until they are 71.9 and 73.1 years old.People who live in Republican-leaning states tend to have less money, worse health conditions, higher rates of gun-related deaths and lower levels of education than people living in Democratic states.On average, people in red states have higher rates of poverty than residents of blue states.Poverty is an indicator for life expectancies in the U.S.\u2014the poorer someone is, the more likely to die younger.But there are likely other issues at play in people in red states' having lower life spans.      Health differencesResearch in 2020 showed that Americans in blue states tend to live longer than people in red states, primarily because of state policies on everything from seat belt laws to abortion laws. That research also identified health policies as a major factor.People in blue states also tend to have higher rates of health insurance than people in red states.Moreover, when looking at the rates of people who are diagnosed with cancer in each state, it is clear that people in red states are generally less healthy than people in blue ones. Red-state residents are also more likely to die from heart disease than people in blue states.But health rates vary greatly across racial and ethnic groups. Black and Hispanic people are far more likely than white and Asian people in the U.S. to not have access to quality affordable health care, regardless of their state of residence.And Black people remain more likely than white people to have high blood pressure and to die from heart disease, among other health conditions.Lower education levelsAnother key factor in this life span trend is that people in red states have lower levels of education than people in blue states.This matters, since some recent research has shown that education levels are the best predictor of a person's life span for a variety of complex, interconnected reasons, including an increased likelihood that receiving a higher education will lead to a boost in income.Experts also often consider race and ethnicity another major factor, in part because of structural inequalities facing people of color that may place access to quality affordable education out of reach, for example.Lack of education may be the most direct reason for lower incomes and shorter lives\u2014but it is not clear if attaining a higher level of education makes people wealthier, or if people who are born into wealth receive more and better education.Are people moving to die young?There are other reasons that factor into the complex question of life expectancy, and discrepancies in longevity across states.One reason identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for example, is that there are more gun deaths\u2014by homicide and suicide\u2014in red states than blue states.People are moving to different states in the U.S. for a variety of reasons\u2014including, in some cases, political ideologies. While blue ZIP codes have been found to be getting bluer, red ones are becoming even more red.But it is important to keep in mind that data on life spans and health are simply averages, and so there can be a high variation within particular locations.Thee are people in red and blue states who defy these statistics\u2014many people living long lives in poor red states, and people dying younger in rich blue ones.Still, the overall trends are clear. People living in blue states\u2014by and large\u2014tend to live longer, healthier and wealthier lives.

  "text": "Children living with long-term poverty and whose families rely on food banks are more likely to achieve lower GCSE grades, finds a report co-authored by UCL researchers.          Pupils in these families achieved half a grade lower per subject than they would be expected to, even taking previous grades and other aspects of household finances into account. The authors say this raises concerns about the long-term impact of the cost-of-living crisis.The study also found that just over four in five (81%) of parents and more than half (54%) of young people in families struggling financially report poor mental health. One in ten young people live in households classed as 'food insecure', meaning they lack reliable access to enough affordable and healthy food.The COVID Social Mobility & Opportunities (COSMO) study is jointly led by the UCL Centre for Education Policy & Equalising Opportunities (CEPEO), the UCL Centre for Longitudinal Studies and the charity Sutton Trust. The study, the largest of its kind, is tracking the lives of a cohort of 13,000 young people in England who are taking A-Levels and other qualifications in 2023.The report, published by the Sutton Trust, finds that rates of poor mental health were particularly bad for those whose financial situation has worsened since the pandemic. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of parents and over half (53%) of young people who started using food banks during the pandemic reported poor mental health, compared to 33% of parents and 41% of young people who had not.Overall, 39% of households reported a worse financial situation than before the pandemic, with just 16% reporting that their finances had improved. Those reporting a worsening financial situation were most likely to have had fewer resources before the pandemic.Lead author Dr. Jake Anders, Deputy Director, UCL CEPEO, said, \"The mental health and life chances of young people and their parents are being dramatically affected by post-pandemic cost of living pressures. And these impacts are likely to be long-lasting, given the seeming link between food insecurity and performance in exams.\"\"That so many are food insecure but would not be considered eligible for free school meals under current rules suggests that the eligibility criteria are in need of urgent review. No young people should be going hungry, especially if this has the potential for serious long-term impacts.\"Well over half (57%) of households in the study where young people went hungry were not eligible for Free School Meals (FSM) and 36% of those using food banks were not FSM eligible either. The findings raise questions of whether eligibility is set at the right level, particularly given the rising cost of food.Overall, one in ten young people were living in households which were classed as food insecure, with many reporting running out of food and skipping meals. Some parents (5%) even reported going an entire day without eating. Rates of food insecurity were highest in the north east and north west of England (at 15% and 12%) compared to the south east (9%) and east of England (7%).Sir Peter Lampl, Founder & Chairman of the Sutton Trust and Chairman of the Education Endowment Foundation, said, \"The link between financial insecurity, mental health and academic attainment is very concerning. Young people have already faced many challenges due to the pandemic, and now they and their families are facing serious financial pressures due to the cost-of-living crisis.\"\"Unless action is taken, there is likely to be a worsening of mental health which will affect a whole generation. The government should review financial support for families and boost investment in schools so that vulnerable children are not left behind.\" More information:Report: cosmostudy.uk/publication_pdfs \u2026 and-the-pandemic.pdfProvided byUniversity College LondonCitation:Lower GCSE grades for children in families relying on food banks (2023, May 25)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-gcse-grades-children-families-food.html  This document is subject to copyright.

The following one shows the text fully restored, in the form it achieved over 100 years later, when a new fragment of it was published in 2007.He who saw the Deep, the foundation of the country,who knew the proper ways, was wise in all matters!Gilgamesh, who saw the Deep, the foundation of the country,who knew the proper ways, was wise in all matters!Throughout the twentieth century, only the fragmentary version of the prologue of the epic was known. Generations of readers, when first confronted with the foremost classic of ancient Mesopotamian literature, experienced the frustration of reading a fragmentary text, of being allowed only a latticed glimpse into the world of the Babylonians.The original text was written in cuneiform, the most widespread and historically significant writing system in the ancient Middle East. Its name comes from the wedge-shaped impressions (in Latin, cuneus) that form its signs.                Manuscript NipNB1 (IM.77087) of Advice to a Prince (Photograph by Anmar A. Fadhil, by permission of the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage and The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago). Credit: Electronic Babylonian Library, Author provided             Regarding the impossibility of reading the whole poem, a cuneiformist expressed in frustration: \"The opening lines of the Epic of Gilgamesh, unfortunately, still cannot be completely read without making ample use of the imagination.\"This frustration is, even today, every cuneiformist's bread and butter, often experienced \"when one struggles with a fragmentary text in the Students' Room of the British Museum and suspects with more or less reason that unidentified pieces are lying in drawers just a few meters away.\" Enter the Electronic Babylonian Library Platform (eBL).Reaching to Babylonian literatureThe primary objective of the eBL project is to advance the understanding of Babylonian literature by reconstructing it to the fullest extent possible. Additionally, the project aims to provide a user-friendly platform containing extensive transliterations of cuneiform tablet fragments, along with a robust search tool, to address the abiding problem of the fragmented nature of Mesopotamian literature.The backbone of the project is the Fragmentarium, which digitally brings together transliterations of fragments of cuneiform tablets. These cuneiform tablets were mostly excavated in the 19th century, and have been stored in the drawers of various museums since.In particular, the British Museum holds hundreds of thousands of cuneiform tablets, many of which have not been read since antiquity. Our collaboration with the British Museum has digitized tens of thousands of these tablets, and transliterated them in the Fragmentarium.If the Fragmentarium is the backbone of the project, its showcase is the eBL Corpus. The corpus is conceived to contain editions of all \"classics\" of Babylonian literature copied during the first millennium BCE, from the Epic of Creation to the Poem of the Righteous Sufferer.The eBL editions use many previously unpublished or unedited fragments, often identified by the members of the project, and thus represent cutting-edge versions of the texts.      Relating the databasesThe main problem we face is getting these two large textual databases (Fragmentarium and Corpus) to talk to each other. The literature from ancient Mesopotamia is still riddled with textual gaps, and the identification of fragments to fill these gaps has traditionally been slow and laborious due to the ambiguities of cuneiform script.Indeed, cuneiform writing knows no orthography. There is no single, standard way of writing a word. Scribes, when copying traditional texts, would adapt them to their specific dialects or spelling preferences. Consequently, the task of fragment identification becomes challenging, as the signs present in one fragment may differ from those found in another.                Reconstruction of the manuscript K.4981+ from nine discrete fragments previously transliterated in the Fragmentarium. Author provided             As is the case in many ancient and modern writing systems, the same cuneiform character can represent multiple phonetic readings and whole words. When there is sufficient context, then multiple meaning is not a problem: usually there is only one correct reading for each sign.In a recent project, we trained an AI model with a relatively small corpus (less than 20,000 lines) and without using a sign list, to make this multiple meaning clear\u2026 The computer achieved a success rate of 98%.With isolated fragments, however, there is no correct reading of a character. The reading only becomes possible if one identifies where the fragment comes from.Also, we do not have a single complete cuneiform tablet from which to reconstruct the beginning of a work like Gilgamesh. Instead, we possess a multitude of manuscripts, some of which overlap. Typically, only a few fragments of each manuscript survive.The key to identifying additional pieces, and thus to advancing the reconstruction, lies in discovering overlaps between fragments, which will, in turn, enable the discovery of further overlaps with other fragments, and so on.Words as our historical DNAInterestingly, the substitutions encountered in cuneiform texts bear resemblance to genetic variations found in DNA. Taking into account such variations is a central concern in bioinformatics, which has lead to the development of numerous sequence alignment algorithms.The eBL project has implemented similar string alignment algorithm specifically tailored for cuneiform, facilitating the identification process and significantly speeding up progress.Using this algorithm, and the various other utilities that the eBL project has made available to researchers, the team dedicated to it at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich has succeeded in identifying thousands of new fragments and significantly advanced the reconstruction of Babylonian literature.If the 150 years of existence of Assyriology prior to the project found 5,000 cuneiform pieces that could be joined to already known pieces, the five years of the eBL project have added another 1,500 to the tally, and several thousand that cannot be joined directly.The pace is only accelerating, and it is hoped that following the publication of the electronic Babylonian Library portal in February, other researchers and amateurs will use these tools to reconstruct partly lost ancient texts.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards online grocery shopping?",
  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the grocer that offers a fast delivery service?",
  "answer_squad": " Getir",
  "text": "Before the pandemic, online grocery shopping was typically something younger and more affluent people living in cities indulged in. When COVID hit, though, the market exploded.          In the first week of the first UK lockdown, demand for Ocado home deliveries was reportedly ten times higher than it had been the week before. But when COVID restrictions were re-imposed in September 2020, the online supermarket, like its competitors, was still warning customers that slots were selling out fast. So fast, in fact, one staffer said they were going \"like Glastonbury tickets.\"Households struggled to book delivery slots, as supermarkets rightly prioritized deliveries for elderly and vulnerable consumers. And retailers hustled to capitalize on this rapid growth.In April 2020, Tesco told its customers it had hired 12,000 extra staff and 4,000 new delivery drivers. Six months in, Sainsbury's said it was delivering 700,000 online orders per week, having effectively doubled its capacity.In 2019, prior to the pandemic, my colleagues and I mapped online groceries coverage by all the major UK grocers, using the \"check if we deliver to your area\" tool on their websites. We found that where you live affects your choice and availability of online groceries.People in rural areas have less access to supermarkets in general and, when it comes to online grocery shopping, just over 11% of those people have no choice at all.      Lack of choiceWhen households order groceries online from the major supermarkets, their orders are usually assembled in a local supermarket, what industry insiders term an \"online fulfillment store\". These have dedicated staff, storage space, vehicles and drivers.This model, however, means that online groceries are not available in all locations. Rather, they are concentrated around the network of stores that each grocer operates.On each supermarket website we inputted one postcode from each of the 41,735 neighborhoods in Great Britain\u2014representing 25.7m households\u2014and recorded the result. We then counted the number of retailers delivering to each neighborhood.We found that 98% of households in Great Britain are served by at least one of Tesco, Sainsbury's or Asda. These three grocers offer the greatest delivery coverage, particularly in urban and suburban areas where households have a choice of grocer providing home delivery.Other grocers have more restricted coverage. Iceland, a budget retailer with stores in urban areas, serves only 86% of households. Ocado, meanwhile, which is more upmarket and online only, delivers to only 77% of households.Many neighborhoods\u2014in south-west and northern England, south and mid-Wales, and in Scotland's borders, highlands and islands\u2014suffer poor coverage of online groceries.Households in many neighborhoods in Argyll and Bute (Scotland), for example, have a single online groceries provider (Tesco). By contrast, in nearby Glasgow, most neighborhoods have a choice of six online grocery providers.Across Great Britain, we found that over 11% of households in the most remote rural areas have no choice of provider. They must rely on a single grocer (typically Tesco) for online groceries.Why retailers are not expanding into rural areasRural areas that are underserved by supermarkets in general are precisely those that could benefit the most from better online provision. In urban contexts, the older, higher spending consumer demographic was newly converted to online grocery shopping.In rural areas, this same demographic could therefore represent untapped demand. In other words, there is an incentive for retailers to expand there.But that is not happening. We had rare access to data about the nationwide network of Sainsbury's stores. Over 180 of those supermarkets are in London and south-east England, 85 of which are used as online fulfillment stores. This means the retailer is able to deliver groceries to all neighborhoods in these regions.In Wales, by contrast, there are only four Sainsbury's online fulfillment stores concentrated around the major towns and cities in south Wales. We found that home delivery by Sainsbury's was unavailable to 162,000 Welsh households (12%).Even if all existing Sainsbury's supermarkets in Wales were used for online deliveries, over 25% of neighborhoods would still be more than 40km from their nearest fulfillment store. Drivers could have to travel over 100km to make their deliveries. This is prohibitively expensive and inefficient.To expand online groceries coverage beyond the store network, retailers would need to fork out considerable sums to build more stores. Most, however, have cut back on supermarket expansion plans, focusing instead on smaller convenience stores to reflect changing shopper behaviors.Amid changing consumer behaviors, online remains a key battleground for grocers. However, it offers lower profit margins than in-store shopping due to the higher costs of order preparation and delivery.Another solution is the partnership model between grocers and online platforms such as Uber Eats, Just Eat and Deliveroo, who collect customer orders from smaller convenience stores (such as Tesco Express).New players like the Turkish online-only grocer Getir offer rapid delivery services using smaller, more efficient warehouses located close to the customers. However, these, too, are confined to urban areas, for now.Not being able to choose where you shop has several adverse impacts. It can restrict competition in online groceries, which in turn can see customers faced with less choice of delivery slot or higher charges for home delivery.And, as highlighted by the consumer choice champion Which? and the Consumer Data Research Centre, it can hamper access to affordable, healthy groceries, by limiting customers' opportunity to shop around for the best deals and widest range.Quite how this might change though boils down to whether the major grocers or the new innovators are able to make the investments needed to better cater to rural demand. Until then, customers in these areas will face the dual disadvantage of poor access to larger supermarkets and fewer online grocery options to improve things.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards the current police custody system?",
  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What percentage of children were detained overnight?",
  "answer_squad": " 54%",
  "text": "Guidance for police dealing with children in custody must be overhauled, a new study has concluded, where for the first time in England and Wales, researchers engaged with child suspects while they were detained in police custody.          Their findings include:Children were held in custody on average for 11 hours and 36 minutes (with 54% being detained overnight), and 80% requested legal adviceWith children left alone in cells for many hours, their experience of police custody is harsh and punitiveThe majority of children interviewed as part of the study view police custody as part of their punishment\u2014this was also the view of some police officers, with a presumption of guilt rather than innocence.However \"no further action\" was recorded against the majority of child suspectsSome children were detained for their safety with police unable to engage health and social welfare agencies to support the child at short notice\u2014however police then went on to interview them about an alleged offense.The academics conclude that major reforms to the PACE guidelines are needed and enhanced legal protections for child suspects are required. They recommend adopting a \"Child First\" approach, which means viewing child suspects as children rather than adults and/or \"offenders,\" encouraging collaboration with them while they are detained, and seeking to maximize opportunities to divert them away from the stigma of coming into contact with the criminal justice system. They say detention should only be used as a last resort.The experts argue that a Child First approach would have the aim of reducing the number of children brought into police custody and would instead require the adoption of diversion, minimum intervention and problem-solving and restorative approaches. For those children who must be detained, a child-focused and rights-based approach needs to be adopted in custody that differentiates children from adult suspects.Lord Carlile of Berriew CBE KC, Chair of the study's Steering Group, said, \"For the first time, the findings presented in this report illuminate in depth what happens during the early stages of the criminal process in police custody from a child's perspective. For too long, what happens to children drawn into police custody has been hidden. The comprehensive set of measures set out in this report provides a framework within which changes to PACE can be piloted by researchers in partnership with the police and other agencies.\"      The study found that while police custody officers have the power not to authorize the detention of someone arrested and brought into custody if they deem it unnecessary, this occurred in less than 1% of cases\u2014despite, in the majority of cases, no action being taken by the end.In relation to the final case outcome, while 21% of children were charged and 14% received an out-of-court disposal (such as a caution), \"no further action\" was recorded against 56% of the child suspects and a further 5% of cases remaining outstanding.In all cases observed by the researchers, once a child was detained, even if custody was effectively being used as a place of safety (due to the police being unable to engage health and social welfare agencies in supporting the child at short notice), the priority for the police was to interview the child about an alleged offense.Under PACE guidelines it is mandatory for a child to have an appropriate adult to support them while they are detained but, generally, due to restrictions in them gaining access to police custody, the study found that contact with the child was limited until just prior to the police interview.Similarly, in most cases where legal advice was requested, a child's first contact with their lawyer tended to be just before the police interview. The researchers argue that these delays are not acceptable, not least because a child needs access to these adults as soon as practicable following detention so that they can help them to understand and exercise their legal rights.With children being left alone in a cell for many hours waiting to be interviewed, they experienced police custody as harsh and punitive, fostering resentment and undermining trust in the police and the wider youth justice system.The academics say that they are concerned that not only did the majority of children in the case studies view police custody as part of their punishment, but this was also the view of some police officers, with a presumption of guilt rather than innocence.The researchers suggest that, with no action being taken in the majority of cases, the early involvement of the lawyer, appropriate adult, health and/or social welfare services could have led to cases being resolved more quickly or being taken out of the criminal process altogether.Dr. Vicky Kemp, study lead and Principal Research Fellow in the School of Law at the University of Nottingham, said, \"When viewing the harsh realities of police custody through the lens of a child, it becomes all too clear that children should not be brought into this environment unless they are being dealt with for very serious offenses. Instead of a punitive and adult-centered approach, a child-friendly and child-centered system of justice needs to prioritize problem-solving and restorative approaches that help in reducing offending.\"As part of the study, 51,504 electronic custody records were examined, with 3,722 (7%) relating to children. These were drawn from eight police forces in England and Wales for two separate months (March and September) in each of 2019, 2020 and 2021. These records included information about the time children spent in custody, whether legal advice was requested and the outcomes of cases. They also contained demographic information about each child's age, gender and ethnicity.A total of 32 observational case studies were carried out in eight custody suites in three police force areas with a view to further understanding child suspects' experiences both while detained and during the police interview, and how they understood their legal rights. This data included at least one research interview with each child, with these interviews taking place prior to and/or after the police interview. Where possible, those involved in the questioning of the child\u2014including police interviewers, the lawyer and the child's appropriate adult\u2014were also interviewed. The case studies also included examining recordings of police interviews and talking to custody staff.Rob Street, Director of Justice at the Nuffield Foundation, said, \"This important study focuses on a critical aspect of the youth justice process\u2014police detention and questioning of children\u2014that often does not get the attention that it should. The research vividly illustrates how essential it is to take account of children's needs at this stage, but also the challenges of doing so.\" Provided byUniversity of NottinghamCitation:'Harsh reality' for children in police custody detailed in new UK study (2023, May 25)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-harsh-reality-children-police-custody.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "In 2021, Facebook made \"metaverse\" the buzziest word on the web, rebranding itself as Meta and announcing a plan to build \"a set of interconnected digital spaces that lets you do things you can't do in the physical world.\" Since then, the metaverse has been called many different things. Some say it is the \"future of the internet.\" Others call it \"an amorphous concept that no one really wants.\"          For Diego G\u00f3mez-Zar\u00e1, an assistant professor in the University of Notre Dame's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, the metaverse is something else: a tool for better science.In \"The Promise and Pitfalls of the Metaverse for Science,\" published in Nature Human Behavior, G\u00f3mez-Zar\u00e1 argues that scientists should take advantage of the metaverse for research while also guarding against the potential hazards that come with working in virtual reality.Virtual environments, real benefitsAlong with co-authors Peter Schiffer (Department of Applied Physics and Department of Physics, Yale University) and Dashun Wang (McCormick School of Engineering, Northwestern University), G\u00f3mez-Zar\u00e1 defines the metaverse as a virtual space where users can interact in a three-dimensional environment and take actions that affect the world outside.The researchers say the metaverse stands to benefit science in four main ways.First, it could remove barriers and make science more accessible. To understand these opportunities, G\u00f3mez-Zar\u00e1 says, we need not speculate about the distant future. Instead, we can point to ways researchers have already begun using virtual environments in their work.At the University College London School of Pharmacy, for example, scientists have made a digital replica of their lab that can be visited in virtual reality. This digital replica allows scientists at various points around the world to meet, collaborate and make decisions together about how to move a research project forward.Similarly, a virtual laboratory training developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention teaches young scientists in many different locations to identify the parts of a lab and even conduct emergency procedures.This example shows a second benefit: improving teaching and learning.G\u00f3mez-Zar\u00e1 explains, \"For someone training to become a surgeon, it is very hard to perform a procedure for the first time without any mistakes. And if you are working with a real patient, a mistake can be very harmful. Experiential learning in a virtual environment can help you try something and make mistakes along the way without harmful consequences, and the freedom from harmful consequences can improve research in other fields as well.\"G\u00f3mez-Zar\u00e1 is also working with a team at Notre Dame's Virtual Reality Lab to understand a third potential benefit, one related to the social side of science. The research team studies the effects of online environments on a team's work processes. They find that virtual environments can help teams collaborate more effectively than videoconferencing.\"Since the pandemic, we have all become comfortable videoconferencing,\" says G\u00f3mez-Zar\u00e1. \"But that doesn't mean getting on a video call is the most effective tool for every task. Especially for intense social activities like team building and innovation, virtual reality is a much closer replica of what we would have offline and could prove much more effective.\"G\u00f3mez-Zar\u00e1 says the metaverse could also be used to create wholly new experimental environments.\"If you can get data and images from somewhere, you can create a virtual replica of that place in virtual reality,\" G\u00f3mez-Zar\u00e1 explains. For example, he says, we have images of Mars captured by satellites and robots. \"These could be used to create a virtual reality version of the environment where scientists can experience what it is like there. Eventually they could even interact with the environment from a distance.\"      Potential pitfallsG\u00f3mez-Zar\u00e1 emphasizes that realizing the full benefits of the metaverse will also require us to avoid several pitfalls associated with it.There are still barriers to using virtual reality. Virtual reality goggles and related equipment, while becoming more affordable, still require a significant investment.This issue relates to a larger one: Who owns the metaverse? Currently, a few technology companies control the metaverse, but G\u00f3mez-Zar\u00e1 notes that there have been calls for agencies and others who support research to invest in building an open, public metaverse. In the meantime, he says, it is important for researchers to think through questions of ownership and privacy any time they work in the metaverse.His overall message, though, is a hopeful one. \"We still tend to associate the metaverse with entertainment and casual socialization. This makes it all too easy to dismiss,\" he says. \"But look at how quickly we have all adapted to technologies we used rarely before the pandemic. It could be the same way with the metaverse. We need the research community exploring it. That is the best way to plan for the risks while also recognizing all of the possibilities.\" More information:Diego G\u00f3mez-Zar\u00e1 et al, The promise and pitfalls of the metaverse for science, Nature Human Behaviour (2023).

  "text": "An international team of archaeologists has found what may be the earliest known saddle at a dig site in China. In their paper published in the journal Archaeological Research in Asia, the group describes where the ancient saddle was found, its condition and how it was made.       The saddle was discovered in a tomb at a cemetery in Yanghai, China. The tomb was for a woman dressed in what appeared to be riding gear\u2014the saddle was situated in a way to make it look as if she were sitting on it. Dating of the woman and saddle show they are from approximately 2,700 years ago.Prior research has found that domestication of horses first occurred approximately 6,000 years ago, though in the initial stages of domestication, the animals were used as a source of meat and milk. It is believed that riding of horses took another 1,000 years to develop. Logic suggests soon thereafter, riders began looking for ways to cushion the ride. Saddles, researchers have suggested, likely originated as little more than mats tied to the horses back. Also, as the team on this new effort notes, saddles allowed riders to ride longer, which allowed them to roam farther and ultimately to interact with people in distant areas.

DOI: 10.1016/j.ara.2023.100451             Prior research has shown that the people who lived in the area where the saddle was found, now known as the Subeixi culture, moved into the region approximately 3,000 years ago. It now appears that they may have been riding horses when they arrived.The saddle the team found had been made by creating cushions from cowhide and stuffing them with deer and camel hair along with straw. It also allowed for sitting up, which helps riders aim better when shooting arrows. There were no stirrups, however. The research team suggests the more likely purpose of riding horses was to assist with herding animals.The age of the saddle found in China predates that of ancient saddles found in the central and western Eurasian Steppe. The earliest of those has been dated back to sometime between the fifth and third centuries B.C. The researchers suggest that the earliest use of saddles was by people in China.

  "text": "What role does a person's circle of acquaintances play in whether they will turn out to vote? If people think their friends and family will vote, does that create social pressure for them to vote as well? Does the thought that others will know whether they voted and fear of their disapprove have an impact?          Maxime Coulombe, a student in the Department of Political Science at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, is trying to answer these questions as part of his doctoral research on social behavior around elections.His most recent study, published in the journal Electoral Studies, found that people who expect others to vote are more likely to vote themselves but found no evidence that disapproval or visibility\u2014believing that others will know whether you voted\u2014has a positive influence on the decision to vote.Under the supervision of UdeM professors Andr\u00e9 Blais and Ruth Dassonneville, Coulombe surveyed more than 1,000 people during the 2019 Canadian federal election campaign. He asked three questions about the respondent's partner, family, friends and neighbors:Do you think they will vote?If you decide not to vote, how would they view your decision?Do you think they will know whether you voted?Coulombe found that the closer a person was to the respondent (e.g. a partner or family member), the more likely they were to have an influence. However, he did not find evidence that expectations of visibility and disapproval were associated with voting decisions.Coulombe then worked with Martial Foucault, a professor at the Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Paris, to replicate his study in France with a survey of over 10,000 respondents during the 2022 presidential election. This time, preliminary results suggest that fear of disapproval does appear to be a driver.\"In my review of the literature, I found that one out of two studies comes to this conclusion, so more investigation is needed to find out why this variation exists,\" Coulombe said.It's all about perceptionCoulombe's study looks at voting through a sociological lens. His data suggest that voting is not entirely an individual decision but is modulated by a person's immediate environment.He found that descriptive norms (what others do) carry more weight than injunctive norms (what others think we should do). \"We aren't influenced by the norm per se but rather by our perception of the norm, which creates social pressure to conform,\" he explained. \"For example, if I believe only two out of eight members of my family will vote because I think they're apolitical, I may be less likely to vote myself. I could actually be wrong and seven of the eight will vote, but my decision is guided by my perception\u2014or in this case, misperception.\"Coulombe therefore believes that descriptive pressure could be used to encourage people to do their civic duty. \"We could point to statistics that show voting is the norm,\" he suggested, \"and we should avoid saying that few people vote.\" More information:Maxime Coulombe, Does it matter whether people will know that I did not vote?

  "answer_squad": " Rungholt",
  "text": "The medieval trading center of Rungholt, which is today located in the UNESCO Wadden Sea World Heritage Site and currently the focus of interdisciplinary research, drowned in a storm surge in 1362.          Using a combination of geoscientific and archaeological methods, researchers from Kiel University (CAU), Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU), the Center for Baltic and Scandinavian Archaeology (ZBSA), and the State Archaeology Department Schleswig-Holstein (ALSH), both in Schleswig, have now succeeded in locating the site of the Rungholt church. Thus, they can now finally clarify a much-discussed research question that has been going on for over 100 years.Interdisciplinary cooperation as the key to successWithin the framework of two interdisciplinary projects by the German Research Foundation (DFG), i.e., the RUNGHOLT project and the Wadden Sea project in the ROOTS Cluster of Excellence, research has been conducted for several years on the medieval cultural landscape disappeared in the Wadden Sea.Well known for its mythically exaggerated destruction and an archaeological find situation unique in Europe, Rungholt is a prominent example of the effects of massive human intervention in the northern German coastal region that continue to this day.                The researchers use sediment cores to record settlement remains and to reconstruct landscape evolution at selected sites on the tidal flats. Credit: Justus Lemm             The key to the success of the work lies in a close interdisciplinary collaboration. \"Settlement remains hidden under the mudflats are first localized and mapped over a wide area using various geophysical methods such as magnetic gradiometry, electromagnetic induction, and seismics,\" explained Dr. Dennis Wilken, geophysicist at Kiel University.And Dr. Hanna Hadler from the Institute of Geography at Mainz University, added, \"Based on this prospection, we selectively take sediment cores that not only allow us to make statements about spatial and temporal relationships of settlement structures, but also about landscape development.\" Archaeological investigations at selected sites provide unique insights into the life of the North Frisian settlers and repeatedly bring to light significant new finds from the tidal flats.First large-scale reconstruction of Rungholt's drowned cultural landscape with a central churchIn May 2023, a previously unknown two kilometer long chain of medieval terps, which are artificial settlement mounds, was recorded by geophysical prospection near Hallig S\u00fcdfall. One of these terps shows structures that can undoubtedly be interpreted as the foundations of a church 40 meters to 15 meters in size. First corings and excavations have provided initial insights into the structure and foundations of the sacred building.                A special metal frame allows archaeological excavations of one square meter in the tidal flats. The finds are excavated and documented during low tide. Credit: Ruth Blankenfeldt             \"The find thus joins the ranks of the large churches of North Frisia,\" stated Dr. Bente Sven Majchczack, archaeologist in the ROOTS Cluster of Excellence at Kiel University.Dr. Ruth Blankenfeldt, archaeologist at ZBSA, added, \"The special feature of the find lies in the significance of the church as the center of a settlement structure, which in its size must be interpreted as a parish with superordinate function.\"So far, the finds in the area investigated, which covers more than ten square kilometers, include 54 terps, systematic drainage systems, a sea dike with a tidal gate harbor as well as two sites of smaller churches\u2014and now also a large main church. The settlement area found must therefore be regarded as one of the historically reported main sites of the medieval administrative district of Edomsharde.      Erosion threatens cultural remains In addition to the unique archival character that the mudflats have for the reconstruction of Rungholt's cultural landscape, the project results of recent years also show the extreme endangerment of the cultural traces that are over 600 years old.\"Around Hallig S\u00fcdfall and in other mudflats, the medieval settlement remains are already heavily eroded and often only detectable as negative imprints. This is also very evident around the church's location, so we urgently need to intensify research here,\" said Dr. Hanna Hadler.

  "answer_squad": " Julius Nyerere",
  "text": "In the 1940s, a student from Kenya named James Gekonyo applied to the Chemistry Department of Makerere University in Uganda. When his admissions interviewers asked him to explain the difference between a solid, liquid, and gas, Gekonyo said, \"I can hold a solid in my hand and it will stay there; a liquid will run to the floor, and I cannot hold a gas at all.\" Gekonyo was denied admission\u2014his answer was deemed \"silly\" by the interviewers.          Gekonyo's interview is just one example of how both interlinguistic and intralinguistic translation can falter and succeed, writes Morgan J. Robinson. In the article \"When a Wonder Is Not a Wonder: Swahili, Translation, and the Communication of Knowledge,\" published in Isis: A Journal of the History of Science Society, Robinson explores these questions within the context of the translation of Swahili language and knowledge during the colonial and postcolonial periods in Tanganyika/Tanzania.Swahili has been a recorded written language for centuries and traces its roots back over 1,200 years, but colonial-era European academics became interested in the language because they inaccurately believed it represented an early stage of linguistic development. Despite this perception, when British missionaries began working on Zanzibar, they soon set to learning Swahili.They devised a way to write it in Latin script and produced dictionaries and a language handbook, learning the language from\u2014among others\u2014an eminent Islamic jurist, his associates, and the mission's students. Translation occurred through this web of interlocuters who suggested, affirmed, and revised word lists until all understood.Yet even as missionaries attempted to codify Swahili, their students shaped it to fit their needs. Robinson cites, for example, the word \"kuchenja\"\u2014a hybrid the students created of the English word \"to change\" and the Swahili verb prefix \"ku-.\" This \"linguistic flexibility and creativity,\" Robinson writes, demonstrates \"that translation was rarely as simple as moving between a source and a target language\u2014both of which were perpetually in flux.\"As Britain consolidated its colonial rule in the 1920s, the administration formed a committee to standardize written Swahili into a \"developed\" language. It sought to insert the language of science into Swahili (deemed impossible by some) while creating dictionaries and coining new words. The committee was occasionally \"confronted by the fact that not only is language a moving target, but so, too, is knowledge.\"With the dawn of the independence era, translation problems and solutions began to be framed differently, Robinson writes. Tanzania's first president Julius Nyerere used Swahili as an anti-colonial rallying cry and symbol, stressing the connection between the language and the nascent nation. Swahili proved to be a potent national symbol and provided some solutions to translation problems experienced during the missionary and colonial eras.The author of a science column published in the newspaper Mambo Leo shortly before independence wrote effusively about new technology, clearly demonstrating that the colonial concern that Swahili couldn't convey such complexity was a moot point. Yet a later column confronted the issue of knowledge translation, describing how nature can still astonish the experts, sometimes anticipating the wonders and amazement of technological change.In the paper's conclusion Robinson emphasizes the role power plays in translation, setting the parameters for what language and expertise was accepted. Writing of ongoing efforts to translate scientific research into African languages and to bring research conducted in Africa onto an equal playing field with the rest of the world, Robinson writes: \"Such initiatives are at once hopeful signs of progress and frank reminders that certain communicators of knowledge continue to confront familiar and damaging barriers and that stark inequalities persist in the current global landscape of knowledge production and communication.\" More information:Morgan J.

  "answer_squad": " The Violence at University project",
  "text": "Researchers from City, University of London, in collaboration with the University of Surrey, De Montfort University, Universities UK (UUK) and the National Centre (NatCen) for Social Research have conducted the first pilot study into students' experiences of all forms of violence and victimization at UK universities.          The Violence at University project, led by Dr. Carrie-Anne Myers, Reader in the Department of Sociology and Criminology at City, aimed to investigate whether an effective tool could be developed for tracking when, where and how incidents take place.Tackling violence and harassment has been high on universities' agenda for several years. Hate crime has a considerable impact on young people in particular, with potential long-lasting damage to self-esteem and emotional health as well as a fall in student attainment. In 2016, UUK launched a strategic framework titled 'Changing the Culture' to support universities in responding to and preventing violence and crime affecting university students.The pilot project worked with university students to create a questionnaire that could measure the incidence of violence in all forms on university campuses and beyond. A resulting survey explored demographics of respondents, as well as their experiences of sexual, identity-based, and broader forms of violence, and both the reporting and barriers to reporting it.Key findings from the initial survey included:The survey attracted 263 responses which detailed encounters of sexual, identity-based and broader incidents of violence that had either happened, were happening or repeatedly took place, either on campus or elsewhere.The survey uncovered a mix of responses to whether or not these incidents had been reported, with 47 percent saying they had and 46 percent saying they had not.Respondents named a range of support mechanisms they had sought, including friends and fellow students, student representatives, professional and/or teaching staff and tutors.When asked about barriers to reporting violence, students cited emotional factors (feeling embarrassed or ashamed, or traumatized), practical reasons (not knowing who to talk to, not wanting the hassle), social reasons (fear of being treated differently by peers), trust, and fear of perpetrators finding out.The project ran from November 2020 to December 2021, with the survey live for students from across the research universities and beyond between February and September 2021. The survey contained 35 questions that allowed respondents to answer anonymously with a combination of quantitative and qualitative responses.Dr. Myers said the results of the pilot questionnaire show the usefulness of using survey data to tackle violence at university and make students aware of the support available to them. \"A key gap in our understanding of violence in universities relates to the collection of data,\" she said.\"Most data collected on crime only incorporates household responses which generally excludes the student population that might live in halls of residence. There is not a lot of information about how students are affected by violence.\"\"By working alongside students to produce a pilot survey, we show that violence is measurable within a university context.\"Although demonstrating clear feasibility, the Violence at University project report makes the following recommendations to improve future iterations of the survey:Using a more targeted sample rather than a self-selected one to include voices that were absent from the pilot approach\u2014including males\u2014to remove selection bias.A need to focus on well-being to trigger discussions on the experience of violence, with a reordering of questions to ease participants into these discussions rather than potentially off-putting phrases early on.Closer investigation of online vs. offline incidents.Experiences of violence and well-being needs of students prior to attending university.Greater consideration of classism and the feeling of discrimination from students based on their backgrounds, especially in light of many universities' widening participation agendas.Dr. Myers added that with small changes to the initial survey design, universities could use it as a practical tool to prevent incidents and protect students.\"Our initial results show that many are reluctant to report violence and harassment, whether through fear of doing so or not being aware of appropriate channels.\"\"However, this was only intended as a feasibility study. A larger-scale prevalence survey could benchmark and monitor ongoing experiences of violence and the consequences it has on well-being and attainment.\"\"It would also help their institutions identify issues, target deterrents and provide relevant and adequate support streams.\" More information:Report: www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/what- \u2026 new-survey-availableProvided byCity University LondonCitation:How can universities better understand students' experiences of violence and victimization?

Early childhood education and care provides an environment where these concerns can be addressed as early as possible, particularly by supporting children's social-emotional development.          Social-emotional development denotes, among other things, the development of children's emotional and interactive competencies.Research on the topic remains scarce in Finland\"Even though there is international research on supporting social-emotional development, there is still little scholarly evidence on the impact of support measures. In our project, we wanted to investigate the impact of two Finnish methods designed for use in daycare centers,\" says Postdoctoral Researcher Silja Martikainen.The daycare centers under study utilized SAGA, a technique of shared storybook reading developed by Professor Mirjam Kalland, whereby children are encouraged to identify the thoughts and emotions of the characters in the stories and describe them.The other method utilized constituted art-based activities built around an animation character named Pikkuli created by Mets\u00e4marja Aittokoski, with episodes of the animated series, books and music as the material. Pikkuli emotion cards also were used in support of advancing emotional competence. Early childhood educators were trained in implementing both interventions.Both interventions supported children's developmentOver 10 weeks, a total of 150 children from 15 different daycare groups participated in the study. At the time, the social-emotional development of the children involved in the intervention sessions was compared with that of a group engaged in regular small group activities.The study found that both interventions, SAGA and Pikkuli, strengthened children's ability to help and support other children and reduced internalizing problems including withdrawn behavior and symptoms of depression and anxiety.In addition, social orientation in relationships was advanced in the children who took part in the SAGA sessions, while their difficulties in focusing or getting into conflicts with others were reduced. No change was observed in these areas in the control group.Positive experiences of the interventions among early childhood educatorsThe experiences of early childhood educators were positive.\"The staff involved in SAGA interventions stated that the model was an easily deployable addition during regular reading sessions. Children's profound thoughts on emotions even surprised the staff,\" says Kalland.The experiences of the staff involved in Pikkuli activities were also positive. According to Mets\u00e4marja Aittokoski, the creator of Pikkuli, the staff felt that the children's ability to talk about emotions was boosted during the study.\"After the study, the Pikkuli model has been further developed and the content expanded on the basis of the results,\" Aittokoski adds.\"The research findings are encouraging, and the goal is for the methods found to be effective to remain part of regular early childhood education and care. In this too, sufficient human resources must be taken into consideration,\" Silja Martikainen notes.The study is published in the Scandinavian Journal of Educational Research.

  "text": "Parents and caregivers lining up summer camps and other opportunities to occupy their kids when school is out have one more thing to consider as they plan: novelty.          Recent research from the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth has found that new academic content and novel learning approaches and delivery are essential to engaging and challenging bright students through out-of-school learning opportunities. The study was led by Amy Lynne Shelton, executive director of CTY and a professor and former associate dean for research in the Johns Hopkins School of Education, and Sol Bee Jung, who earned her Ph.D. from the School of Education in 2018 before becoming a visiting scholar at CTY in 2019. It was published in Gifted Child Today.\"Advanced learners are engaged by novelty, and that's important because we know from the cognitive science that being invested, emotionally moved, and engaged strengthens and facilitates learning and is one of the best predictors of academic success,\" said Shelton, a cognitive neuroscientist whose research background is in cognitive psychology and neuroscience and focuses on spatial skills, individual differences, and mechanisms of learning.The study used open-ended questions on a program evaluation survey and gauged the perceptions of 205 students in grades 7\u201311 who participated in a three-week university-based academic summer program operated by CTY Greece on the Anatolia College campus in Thessaloniki, Greece.Credit: Johns Hopkins UniversityThe study found:Novelty that successfully engaged students can be reflected in the academic content, such as in courses outside of the standard school curriculum. One example of this is a math course that delves into the theories, formulas, and algorithms underling cryptography.New learning approaches were also effective in engaging students. This new spin on learning might be reflected through a college seminar style class or emphasis on facilitated, problem-based, or hands-on learning experiences.Where both novel academic content and pedagogical approaches were present, students were most likely to express that they were highly satisfied with their course experience and that their interest in the subject matter had increased significantly.\"Different aspects of novelty in learning may resonate differently with individual students,\" Shelton said. \"That's useful in the ways we might improve both our content and our approach because we often provide courses that you might find in a school, but if we can do it in a way that provides that novel approach, then we can get that extra boost.\" More information:Sol Bee Jung et al, Good News!

  "text": "The words different cultures use to describe family members have revealed some intriguing insights\u2014including why in Balto-Slavic languages there is a complicated relationship between in-laws and weasels.          University of Bristol researchers have published a new study in PLOS ONE exploring the links between kinship names in different languages.Fiona Jordan, professor of anthropology from the University of Bristol, has been working with colleagues from Australia, Finland, and Brazil to develop KinBank\u2014a catalog of more than 1,200 languages and their words for family members\u2014known as kinship terminology. It features more than 210,000 kinship terms ranging from cousins to great-grandparents.One of the interesting findings the team have discovered is that the sounds of parental kinship terms can be predicted by the gender of the parent.\"Across the world, parent words often sound like baby babbling, with ma, ba, da sounds,\" Professor Jordan from Bristol's Department of Anthropology and Archaeology explains.\"We were surprised that while father words showed a bias to pa -and ta-, the ma- words could refer to either mum or dad, showing the need for large-scale databases to test these ideas about language variation.\"The team are currently investigating claims that languages that distinguish certain types of cousins do so because some cousins are considered marriageable.As KinBank grows, Professor Jordan believes it will be an invaluable tool for investigating recurring patterns for kinship terminology across cultures.\"We hope this can spark conversations about diversity and family between people from different cultural backgrounds\u2014this is how it is in my family, but do you do it that way?\" Professor Jordan said.\"Anthropologists have documented kinship variation for decades, but our database is the first time the data will be widely accessible.\"We have already discovered some interesting patterns with the 1,156 languages currently in the KinBank\u2014but that is only about 15% of all languages currently spoken in the world. Because kinship terms aren't just words\u2014they capture important aspects of culture too\u2014KinBank will prove a valuable resource for endangered languages.\"Among Balto-Slavic languages, there is a complicated relationship between in-laws and weasels. For example: In the past, the term for daughter-in-law in Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian was the same as for weasel. And in Lithuanian the word for weasel is the same as sister-in-law.The reason behind this relationship is unclear, but might have something to do with old folk tales discouraging adulterous relationships with female-in-laws.The terms for siblings and cousins the team have collected are a perfect example of just how varied kinship language can be.\"In English, we use the terms brother and sister, but this is actually only the third most common way of labeling siblings,\" explains Dr. Sam Passmore from the Australian National University.\"The most common way is to use four sibling categories, like in Japanese. They have different terms for older brother (ani), younger brother (om\u014dto), elder sister (ane), and younger sister (im\u014dto).\"The team also studied how children learn kinship in their community, and found that some cultures prefer personal names to kinship terms. In some languages women show respect to their in-laws by avoiding the use of their names. However, Dr. Alice Mitchell from the Bristol team found that in Datooga (a language spoken in Tanzania), women not only avoid the use of their in-laws' names, but also all similar sounding words.

  "text": "Political parties regularly claim to have their finger on the pulse and be able to read the public mood. Yet a new study challenges the idea that being political makes you good at understanding others: it shows gender, not politics, is a far more important factor in determining people's social skills.          Analysis of a sample of 4,000 people from across the U.K., compiled by a team of psychologists at the University of Bath, highlights that being female and educated are the biggest determinants of whether you can understand or read others' minds.For their study the psychologists looked at qualities associated with understanding others such as agreeableness, picking up on subtle clues and self-reflection. In psychology, this is known as \"theory of mind,\" which is the capacity to understand other people by ascribing mental states to them.The team stress these results represent averages, but they say their study is an important reminder about the drivers of agreement and disagreement in public life. Their findings are published today (Wednesday 24 May) in the journal PLOS One.Age was only associated with understanding others in later life: on average, older people had poorer ability to understand other people.Dr. Punit Shah, senior author, associate professor and leading expert on social cognitive processing at the University of Bath explains, \"In a world where it seems increasingly difficult to hold and express different points of view, it is crucial that we understand the barriers to connecting with other people.\"Political views are often thought of as such a barrier, but our research actually shows that a person's politics is not, in fact, linked to how well they understand others.\"Importantly, we didn't just find an absence of evidence for a political link in the study. The analyses also provided evidence of absence for this link. This is a socially important finding that might help to break down some artificially constructed barriers between people and ultimately improve understanding between different people in our society.\"Shah argues that the link between being educated and female and better understanding other perspectives is also important.He adds, \"Historically male perspectives have been prioritized in society. We are of course seeing this narrative diminish over time, and research like ours adds extra evidence to highlight the important role of education and being female for social understanding and cohesion in society\u2014far more so than politics.\"To conduct the research, the team asked members of the public to provide details about their socio-demographic background, as well as to score their political beliefs (ranging from 1 = very liberal, to 7 = very conservative). They also used a 'mindreading test' to ascertain how well participants understood what other people are thinking.This test\u2014developed by the same team in 2021\u2014asks a series of simple statements, such as: \"I can usually understand another person's viewpoint, even if it differs from my own\"; and \"I find it easy to put myself in somebody else's shoes.\"Lead researcher Dr. Rachel Clutterbuck emphasized that these findings could improve the understanding of social differences between people. \"The reasons for why some people are better at understanding others are not well understood, but this research provides a glimpse into some individual differences, such as gender, which may help to explain these social differences.\"Our results are new because the study considered so many factors\u2014like gender, education, age, and politics\u2014in tandem, rather than looking at them separately as often happens. When we do this, it is clear to see that gender is, by far, most strongly linked to how well others are understood. This finding highlights the complexity of social life and reminds us to consider the various factors that may contribute to understanding and getting on with someone.\" More information:Socio-demographic and Political Predictors of Theory of Mind in Adulthood, PLOS ONE (2023).

  "text": "Young adults engage in online anti-social behavior for fun and social approval, and those who perpetrate this behavior tend to have lower cognitive empathy scores than average, according to a new study published this week in PLOS ONE by Felipe Bonow Soares of University of the Arts London, UK, and colleagues.       Anti-social behavior on social media, such as harassment and bullying, is on the rise. For victims of cyber-aggression, the behavior can lead to several negative outcomes including mental and emotional stress and reduced online participation that leads to further isolation.In the new work, the researchers surveyed undergraduate students at Toronto Metropolitan University who signed up for a Student Research Participation Pool. 557 students participated in the survey between March 9 and April 18, 2022, providing information about their involvement in cyber-aggression or cyber-victimization as well as personality traits including their disinhibition, self-esteem, empathy, and possible motivations for cyber-aggression. 359 students were included in the final analysis.Overall, three factors were associated with the perpetration of online anti-social behavior: recreation, reward and cognitive empathy. Reward and recreation were found to be motives for the behavior, suggesting that young people engage in online anti-social behavior for fun, excitement and social approval. Cognitive empathy was negatively associated with the perpetration of such behavior, suggesting that perpetrators have lower capacity to comprehend the emotions of others, and a lower understanding of how their targets might feel.The authors conclude that empathy-building strategies and interventions that aim to make people think about their actions before posting online could help mitigate cyber-aggression.

  "answer_squad": " Exploring the Possible Function of Paleolithic Open Rings as Spearthrower Finger Loops",
  "text": "When most researchers looked at a puzzling group of artifacts discovered at French archaeological sites, they presumed these to be ornaments or clothing. But Justin Garnett saw something else.          \"They resembled finger loops like those used by some North and South American spearthrowers,\" said Garnett, a doctoral candidate in anthropology at the University of Kansas.That observation led to his new article, \"Exploring the Possible Function of Paleolithic Open Rings as Spearthrower Finger Loops.\" It examines open-ringed objects discovered in the late 19th century at Le Placard, Petit Cloup Barrat and Cave \u00e0 Endives. His research hypothesizes that such rings (fabricated from antler) were finger loops used as part of prehistoric weapon systems. It appears in the Journal of Paleolithic Archaeology.\"If you are familiar with spearthrowers, the shape of it jumps out at you immediately,\" said Garnett, who co-wrote the article with Frederic Sellet, KU associate professor of anthropology. \"So it was like an 'aha moment' when I saw pictures of these objects in a publication. It was hiding in plain sight.\"These particular devices are distinctively shaped like the Greek letter omega, with pointed tabs on either end and an inner opening of approximately 2 centimeters. Since Garnett couldn't use any of the dozen actual items to test his theory, he built his own.He reproduced the open rings in antler, bone and 3D-printed plastic. These were then hafted to speculatively reconstructed spearthrowers.\"I used the 3D ones to get larger sample sizes of specimens so I could test them for comfort. Like how does shape relate to comfort when you're using these things? But then for the actual experiment, I used elk antler since I was unable to get reindeer antler, which is the material that the originals were made out of,\" he said.For testing purposes, he employed them to throw darts, which are similar to large arrows or javelins rather than traditional rigid spears.                Credit: Justin Garnett and Frederic Sellet/University of Kansas             He said, \"Most of these darts are designed to be used as hunting weapons, and their ranges are shorter than ones made to throw long distances because they're heavy enough to inflict damage. So with hunting-weight darts, I could throw them 50 to 60 meters.\"The finger loop artifacts appear in the European Upper Paleolithic period (a later phase of the Stone Age). It shifts the confirmed presence of the spearthrower back from the Magdalenian or Solutrean to the Badegoulian\u2014which is around roughly 22,000 years ago.      \"People are always interested in when a piece of technology first appears. This pushed back the existence of the spearthrower system by 5,000 to 6,000 years\u2014and this feels significant to me in terms of understanding when things originated,\" he said.So how sure is Garnett that these items are actually finger loops for spear-throwing?\"Well, it's a fairly simple shape. It could serve a lot of purposes. It might even be a mistake to assume all 12 of them are the same thing just simply because they have the same shape,\" he said.\"But on a percentage basis of being right, I'd personally say it's in the high 90s. They look exactly like what I would expect a spearthrower finger loop to look like if it were made out of antler. And they come out of digs that also produced other parts of spearthrowers. So it is a tidy explanation borne out by the evidence.\"At KU since 2019, Garnett focuses on technological organization around projectile weaponry. He first became interested in this topic when taking an archeology class as a student at the University of Missouri. Since then, he's taken an active part in the spear-throwing community as an officer in the World Atlatl Association and the Missouri Atlatl Association. (Atlatl means \"spearthrower\" in the Nahuatl language spoken by the Aztecs.)\"The most misunderstood aspect of prehistoric weapons systems is that they are unsophisticated or poorly designed and crude,\" Garnett said. \"I think my research has relevance to today's society because it shows that people all over the world when faced with similar situations do similar things. And prehistoric peoples and technologies were sophisticated and complex in ways we might not initially appreciate.\" More information:Justin Garnett et al, Exploring the Possible Function of Paleolithic Open Rings as Spearthrower Finger Loops, Journal of Paleolithic Archaeology (2023).

  "text": "Political ideology and user choice\u2014not algorithmic curation\u2014are the biggest drivers of engagement with partisan and unreliable news provided by Google Search, according to a study coauthored by Rutgers faculty published in the journal Nature.          The study addressed a long-standing concern that digital algorithms learn from user preferences and surface information that largely agrees with users' attitudes and biases. However, search results shown to Democrats differ little in ideology from those shown to Republicans, the researchers found. The ideological differences emerge when people decide which search results to click, or which websites to visit on their own.Results suggest the same is true about the proportion of low-quality content shown to users. The quantity doesn't differ considerably among partisans, though some groups\u2014particularly older participants who identify as 'strong Republicans'\u2014are more likely to engage with it.Katherine Ognyanova, an associate professor of communication at the Rutgers School of Communication and Information and co-author of the study, said, \"Google's algorithms do sometimes generate results that are polarizing and potentially dangerous. But what our findings suggest is that Google is surfacing this content evenly among users with different political views,\" Ognyanova said. \"To the extent that people are engaging with those websites, that's based largely on personal political outlook.\"Despite the crucial role algorithms play in the news people consume, few studies have focused on web search\u2014and even fewer have compared exposure (defined as the links users see in search results), follows (the links from search results people choose to visit), and engagement (all the websites that a user visits while browsing the web).Part of the challenge has been measuring user activity. Tracking website visits requires access to people's computers, and researchers have generally relied on more theoretical approaches to speculate how algorithms affect polarization or push people into \"filter bubbles\" and \"echo chambers\" of political extremes.To address these knowledge gaps, researchers at Rutgers, Stanford and Northeastern universities conducted a two-wave study, pairing survey results with empirical data collected from a custom-built browser extension to measure exposure and engagement to online content during the 2018 and 2020 U.S. elections.Researchers recruited 1,021 participants to voluntarily install the browser extension for Chrome and Firefox. The software recorded the URLs of Google Search results, as well as Google and browser histories, giving researchers precise information on the content users were engaging with, and for how long.Participants also completed a survey and self-reported their political identification on a seven-point scale that ranged from \"strong Democrat\" to \"strong Republican.\"Results from both study waves showed that a participant's political identification did little to influence the amount of partisan and unreliable news they were exposed to on Google Search. By contrast, there was a clear relationship between political identification and engagement with polarizing content.Platforms such as Google, Facebook and Twitter are technological black boxes: Researchers know what information goes in and can measure what comes out, but the algorithms that curate results are proprietary and rarely receive public scrutiny. Because of this, many blame the technology of these platforms for creating echo chambers and filter bubbles by systematically exposing users to content that conforms to and reinforces personal beliefs.Ognyanova suggests the findings paint a more nuanced picture of search behavior.\"This doesn't let platforms like Google off the hook,\" she said. \"They're still showing people information that's partisan and unreliable. But our study underscores that it is content consumers who are in the driver's seat.\" More information:Ronald E.

  "text": "Keeping in touch via video, phone and instant messaging was little help in preventing a rise in people's anxiety and depression during the pandemic lockdowns, a major new U.K. study has found.          Many young people who increased their use of video and messaging with friends and family who they couldn't see face-to-face experienced a deterioration in their mental health, the research says.Dr. Patrick Rouxel and Professor Tarani Chandola, of the University of Hong Kong, analyzed data on more than 16,000 people's internet use, mental health and social isolation from four British surveys carried out during lockdowns in 2020 and 2021. They found that:People who used video or phones every day to keep in touch with family and friends outside their household were only 3% lower on a scale for anxiety-depression than those who never did.People who using internet messaging services such as Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp every day during the lockdowns had an anxiety-depression score the same as those who never used them.People aged 20 who used social media infrequently before the pandemic were 10% higher on the anxiety-depression scale if they used it every day during lockdown, compared to their peers who used it 2\u20133 times a week during lockdown.\"Early on in the pandemic, several commentators suggested that online communication modes and video technology in particular can bridge social distances during the pandemic,\" the researchers write in an article published in Sociology.\"We found little evidence to support the idea that online modes of social contact could compensate for the restrictions in in-person social contact during the pandemic.\"The reduction in mental health associated with reduced in-person social contact during the pandemic was not offset by online or telephone modes of social contact.\"Young adults who increased their online social media frequency during the pandemic experienced a deterioration in mental health. Young adulthood is a sensitive period of the life-course for social relationships, with increases in online social media frequency during the pandemic having adverse effects on mental health.\"      The research also found that people whose finances had worsened during lockdown had an anxiety-depression level a quarter higher than those who did not.The researchers used data gathered by: the Millennium Cohort Study of people born between 2000 and 2002; Next Steps, on those born 1989\u20131990; the British Cohort Study, on those born in 1970; and the National Child Development Study, on those born in 1958. All the surveys asked about anxiety and depression.The survey covered the periods of May 2020, during the first lockdown; September and October 2020, when restrictions were lifted in many places; and February and March 2021, during the third lockdown.As the surveys did not begin until May 2020 the research does not measure the initial overall increase in anxiety-depression when the first lockdown began in March. However, people's reaction to subsequent lockdowns, and to the ending of the first and second lockdowns, could be measured. The researchers found that, overall, people who had to switch from meeting friends and family outside the home to keeping in touch online experienced up to 5% increase in their anxiety-depression score.The researchers created a scale of anxiety and depression by combining responses to questions from the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item and the Patient Health Questionnaire 2-item. The GAD-2 is a screening tool for generalized anxiety disorder with questions on \"feeling nervous, anxious or on edge\" and \"not being able to stop or control worrying\" over the previous two weeks. The PHQ-2 inquires about the frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia with questions on \"little interest or pleasure in doing things\" and \"feeling down, depressed or hopeless\" over the previous two weeks.Responses for both the GAD-2 and the PHQ-2 ranged from 1 (not at all), 2 (several days), 3 (more than half the days) and 4 (nearly every day). The mean of the four items at each wave was generated with a range from 1 to 4 with higher values indicating greater anxiety and depression. The researchers also used the Kessler scale, a quantifier of non-specific psychological distress (only available in the MCS cohort). It consists of six questions about depressive and anxiety symptoms that a person has experienced in the last 30 days. Responses ranged from 1 (all of the time) to 5 (none of the time). The mean of the six items at each wave was generated with a range from 1 to 5 with higher values indicating greater psychological distress.

  "text": "Researchers have found a stark gender imbalance after carrying out the largest-ever study of video game dialogue, published today.          The research, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, analyzed more than 13,000 video game characters and found that men speak twice as much as women.The study, led by Dr. Stephanie Rennick at the University of Glasgow and Dr. Se\u00e1n G. Roberts at Cardiff University, performed the first large-scale test of gender imbalance in the dialogue of 50 role-playing video games (RPGs).It discovered that games include twice as much male dialogue as female dialogue on average. Of the games studied, 94% had more male dialogue than female dialogue, including games with multiple female protagonists like Final Fantasy X-2 or King's Quest VII.However, the bias isn't just with protagonists\u2014the same imbalances were found in minor characters and persists even when taking into account player choices about protagonist gender and optional dialogue. The study also found the proportion of female dialogue is slowly increasing. If this trend were to continue, it would still take more than a decade to reach parity. Furthermore, there were few characters in non-binary gender categories: only 30 out of 13,000, or about half as much as in real life.Dr. Rennick, Research Associate in Philosophy, School of Humanities at the University of Glasgow, said, \"While we expected to find a larger proportion of male dialogue overall, we were surprised to discover how few games\u2014just three of 50\u2014had more than 50% female dialogue. Players seem to share our surprise: when surveyed, they anticipated the general pattern of more male dialogue, but overestimated the number of games where women spoke the majority of the time.\"The study also found imbalances in who characters speak to. Male characters tend to talk to other male characters, but women talk to other women less than expected by chance, even factoring in the number of lines and female characters. This is similar to the pattern seen in many films that fail to pass the Bechdel test.The study suggests that the imbalance in dialogue is partly caused by the imbalance in the number of characters. Researchers suggest that the simplest way for game-makers to address the imbalance is to add more major and minor female characters. However, the researchers warn that more dialogue doesn't guarantee better gender representation. There can also be bias in the content of dialogue, not just who speaks it. For example, female characters are more likely to apologize, hesitate or be polite, perpetuating stereotypes about gendered behavior.\"Around half of gamers are female, but they experience a lot of abuse and exclusion\" said Dr. Roberts, Lecturer at the School of English, Communication and Philosophy at Cardiff University. \"More diverse representation is being called for by players and developers. So we hope that developers will consider addressing the imbalances we found in order to create more inclusive games.\"The study's resources are open-source, and the team hopes to work with programmers and gamers to expand the study to discover ways of making games more inclusive.

  "text": "Republican politicians typically favor low taxes and less regulation, which seems like a recipe for corporate profits and stock market success. In reality, however, this is not what happens.          Stock markets deliver higher returns during Democratic presidencies than they do during Republican ones, and that has held true for many decades. It's a counterintuitive finding known as the \"presidential puzzle,\" but the observation applies to the market as a whole.Finance researcher Zhi Da wanted to understand more about how presidential politics affects the performance of individual stocks, especially those that could benefit from a president's policies\u2014or be hurt by them.\"Presidential politics affect markets, and any time there is a Democratic president, returns are going to be hot going forward,\" said Da, the Howard J. and Geraldine F. Korth Professor of Finance at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business. Da's recent research, \"Presidential economic approval rating and the cross-section of stock returns,\" examined the performance of individual stocks over a 40-year period.Every president has a policy agenda, and some companies will be more aligned with it than others. Da wanted to understand how this affected a stock's price and eventual returns. He found that companies aligned with a sitting president's policy agenda did have an initial price bump, but it didn't last.When investors observe that a company is aligned with a president's policies, they buy its stock, pushing its price higher. Yet over a one-year horizon, Da found that companies not aligned with presidential policies actually delivered better returns. He argues that this is because investors overvalue the benefits of policy alignment, and push prices higher than the company's actual value. But eventually, investors come to terms with their mistakes, and prices come back to earth.The study, published in the Journal of Financial Economics, was co-authored by Zilin Chen of the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, Dashan Huang of Singapore Management University and Liyao Wang of Hong Kong Baptist University. The researchers built an index of the public approval ratings of the president's handling of the economy between 1981 and 2019. This drew from more than 2,100 polls on economic approval conducted by multiple polling agents, including Gallup, The New York Times and NBC News/The Wall Street Journal. They called it the presidential economic approval rating index, or PEAR for short.      To measure the performance of individual stocks against the index, Da adapted the financial concept of a stock's beta. When markets move, not all stocks increase or decrease by the same amount. A stock's beta quantifies its volatility relative to the overall market. It is a statistical calculation that gives the overall market a value of 1.0. A stock with a beta greater than 1.0 is expected to move more than the overall market; a stock with a beta less than 1.0 is expected to move less.For this research, Da created the measure of PEAR beta, which adapts the concept to measure stock volatility relative to a president's economic approval rating. A stock with a high PEAR beta goes up more than the overall market when a president's economic approval rating is high. A stock with a low PEAR beta goes up less.Consider the case of two energy companies during a time of transition. Renewable Energy Group is a biodiesel firm and New Concept Energy is a traditional energy firm in the oil and gas sector.\"During the presidency of Barack Obama, the stock price of the clean energy firm outperformed the market, while the oil and gas firm did not. This is because when Obama's policies were popular, there was a perception this will benefit clean energy firms. And that new regulations could hurt more heavily polluting traditional energy firms,\" said Da.Under the Obama administration, Renewable Energy Group had a high PEAR beta premium. But despite this apparent tailwind, the company earned lower returns than New Concept Energy. Da called this the low PEAR beta premium.\"This was caused by mispricing on the part of investors. When investors feel firms will do well, they price their stock too high. But when earnings are announced, they have made less money than they expected. They trade out of the stock and its price goes down,\" said Da.\"We found analysts are too optimistic about high PEAR beta firms. Sometimes people get too excited, and there are not enough rational investors in the market to correct the overpricing. Investors need to face the reality of an earnings report before they admit their mistake. Eventually, they face reality and revise their expectations, but it takes up to a year.\"For low PEAR beta firms, it's the opposite story.\"Traditional energy firms didn't do well during the Obama administration, but when earnings came in, investors realized that they delivered pretty nice earnings. And because they make money, prices increase,\" said Da.In an illustration of the connection between the presidency and investor sentiment, the PEAR betas of these two energy stocks converged when Donald Trump was elected president in 2016. Eventually their PEAR betas reversed, and New Concept Energy's stock price got a bump from its perceived alignment with the Trump administration's affinity for fossil fuels.The contrast in energy policy between political parties makes this sector a particularly neat illustration of the concept. But the effect was observed in the wider market through an analysis of a cross-section of monthly stock returns that used data maintained by the Center for Research in Security Prices. On average, stocks with a low PEAR beta premium earned 1 percent higher returns per month.The effect could also be observed in major economies with strong trading ties to the United States, including Canada, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom. Da argues that these findings reveal a market inefficiency that could be leveraged by portfolio managers.\"Taking a practical point of view, we can identify a group of stocks with less risk, that outperform and have higher returns,\" said Da.\"You are systematically taking advantage of money left on the table by investors whose decisions are mostly driven by politics. They are essentially leaving money on the table, and you could pick it up.\" More information:Zilin Chen et al, Presidential economic approval rating and the cross-section of stock returns, Journal of Financial Economics (2022).

  "text": "New data show that while individuals with visual disabilities were slow to recover employment because of the effects of the COVID-2019 lockdown, they have made headway, depending on their level of disability, almost meeting their pre-pandemic levels. Possible reasons for their slower recovery include major safety concerns due to the shortage of personal protective equipment, less access to vaccines, and their vulnerability to severe consequences of COVID, according to experts speaking during a recent nTIDE Deeper Dive Lunch & Learn Webinar.          Using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for persons ages 16-64, the average monthly employment-to-population ratio for April 2022 to March 2023 was 59.8% for individuals who reported vision disabilities only, (people who reported being \"blind or having serious difficulty seeing\" and no other disability) compared to 40.3% for people who reported vision disability (plus at least one other disability). For individuals who reported vision disability with activity limitations (e.g., difficulty with self-care, leaving the house by themselves) the employment-to-population ratio was 14.1%.\"These data show a really slow recovery overall: it took this disability segment until the third year post-lockdown to return to their pre\u2011pandemic employment levels,\" said nTIDE expert Andrew Houtenville, Ph.D., professor of economics at the University of Hampshire (UNH) and research director of the UNH Institute on Disability.The monthly employment-to-population ratio, a key indicator, reflects the number of people in a population who are working, relative to the total number of people in that population. A 12-month average of this indicator is used to boost statistical precision. The 12-month period of April in one year to March in the next year is used to help examine employment trends before and after the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown recession.\"In the Current Population Survey, 'vision disability' can be characterized in numerous ways that make a difference in subsequent employment estimates. For instance, reporting vision difficulty and activity limitation likely indicates a more severe disability, and folks experiencing more severe vision disability are much less likely to be employed,\" Dr. Houtenville explained. \"In the coming months, the nTIDE Deeper Dive will be looking more closely at how people experience disability using data from the six questions in the BLS survey, which asks about hearing difficulty, vision difficulty, cognitive difficulty, ambulatory difficulty, self-care difficulty, and independent living difficulty.\"Impacts on employment recoveryThe reliance on tactile input and the fear of COVID complications post-lockdown may have impacted the employment recovery time for people with blindness and visual impairment. \"The COVID-2019 pandemic probably negatively influenced individuals with vision disabilities who use tactile cues to navigate,\" said Elaine E. Katz, MS, CCC-SLP, senior vice president of Grants and Communications, Kessler Foundation.\"Personal safety issues were a huge concern. Many visually impaired individuals hesitated to go out alone due to concerns about coming into contact with surfaces contaminated by germs or encountering people without masks. People who worked in offices ended up staying home and telecommuting,\" Katz said.Note on data collection and language: When presenting information about disabilities, nTIDE employs the terminology found in the survey that serves as the basis for BLS data, known as the Current Population Survey (CPS).

  "text": "Organizations must enable midlife women to thrive in the workplace by taking inspiration from societies such as China and Japan to encourage positive conversations around the impact of menopause, a new study reveals.          But as they support older women in pursuing their ambitions and accessing career opportunities, organizations must ensure they do not hinder career progression through overlooked promotions, undervalued work, and lost opportunities.In Western countries, menopause is traditionally viewed as a managed medical condition that creates physiological challenges that women must overcome if they are to function as effectively in the workplace as men of a similar age.Publishing their findings today in Gender, Work & Organization, an international team of researchers led by the University of Birmingham, calls on organizations to use a new tool they have developed to address the largely unexplored and underutilized positive, creative, and energizing aspects of menopause.The experts drew from feminist writers, such as Margaret Mead, Virginia Woolf, and Julia Kristeva, as well as 15 years' worth of articles on menopause published by British newspaper The Guardian beginning in 2005, to create their \"dialectic of zest\" tool to destigmatize menopause\u2014long seen as a disease or a disability in Western societies.Co-author Pilar Rojas-Gaviria, from the University of Birmingham, commented, \"Organizations must move towards a positive, creative vision of menopause in the workplace\u2014creating the kind of environment that encourages women to make use of all their talents and creativity as part of the menopause experience. We offer 'the dialectic of zest' as a useful tool for organizations to pursue a better understanding of women in the workplace, addressing not only their needs but also their individual ambitions.\"Western organizations can learn a lot from other cultures. For example, menopause tends to be a more welcome experience in China and Japan. Women in these countries have fewer hot flushes than their US and Canadian counterparts\u2014rarely associating this condition with embarrassment. The terms 'second spring' or 'rebirth' are often associated with menopause in traditional Chinese medicine\u2014suggesting a positive transition into middle age.\"The researchers used feminist writings and articles from The Guardian to describe menopause as a transformational phase that should not be viewed as deterioration and decline. They note that medical interpretations of menopause, while essential for treating health conditions in older women, have overshadowed the lived experiences of aging women.The \"dialectic of zest\" tool describes women's lived experience as an oscillating pendulum swinging between spaces of social conformity and personal liberation. This helps us better understand the multiple experiences of menopause in the workplace.The researchers believe that in the workplace, organizational policies and practices either nourish or obstruct women's experiences and expressions of zest.Two key steps that women experience in the process of liberation are based on Woolf's \"killing the angel in the house\" (stepping away from being devoted to others) and Kristeva's \"discovering the foreigner within\" (focusing on their projects, dreams, and authenticity).If women are freed from the \"angel in the house\"' and discover the \"foreigner\" within, then those experiencing menopause in the workplace will be well-placed to thrive.\"The 'dialectic of zest' tool creates a holistic approach to organizational care, where the full range of concerns, objective and ambitious of women experiencing menopause are considered,\" explained Dr. Rojas-Gaviria. \"This is a powerful perspective that can inspire care not only for women but also for all individuals who may struggle with challenges in the workplace.\"Organizations wishing to benefit from these insightful women must also create opportunities for 'education for all'\u2014a compelling avenue to create the kinds of context where women experiencing menopause can contribute, advance, and thrive.\" More information:Camilla Quental et al, The dialectic of (menopause) zest: Breaking the mold of organizational irrelevance, Gender, Work & Organization (2023).

  "text": "High school students who experience violence or bullying at school are more likely to bring weapons like a gun, knife, or club to school than those who have not experienced violence, according to a new study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.          Because weapons increase the potential for injury and death when there is interpersonal conflict, developing a better understanding of the relationship between exposure to violence and weapon carrying is essential for developing effective public health interventions.\"With 93 school shootings in the US just the 2020-21 period alone, and an average school shooter age of 19.7 years (in school shootings since 1970), the issue of school violence couldn't be more pressing. The occurrence of violence in school settings is an urgent and complex public health problem,\" explained lead investigator Richard Lowry, MD, MS, Office of the Director, National Center for Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA, U.S..\"Our research examined the link between exposure to violence and weapon carrying. We found students who experienced violence at school were much more likely to carry weapons than those who had not experienced violence,\" he noted.Data on 28,442 participants from the CDC's National Youth Risk Behavior Surveys from 2017 and 2019 were analyzed to calculate sex-stratified, adjusted prevalence ratios, which were also adjusted for race/ethnicity, grade, sexual identity, current substance use, suicidal thoughts, and history of concussion. The research is novel because it used recent data available, has results for males and females, and is adjusted for important demographic factors.Overall, 3.3% of US high school students carried a weapon at school. Among all students, 6.6% were threatened or injured with a weapon at school, 19.3% were bullied at school, 8.3% were in a physical fight at school, and 7.7% were absent from school due to safety concerns.Nearly half of males (48.8%) who experienced all of these forms of violence, and nearly a third of females (31.4%) who did, carried weapons at school. Males and females were respectively 3.5 and 3.9 times more likely to carry a weapon if they had been threatened or injured with a weapon at school, and 3.4 and 3.7 times more likely following a physical fight at school. Males who felt unsafe were twice as likely to miss school, while females were three times more likely than those who didn't report feeling unsafe.\"Too often students are victims of violence when they are at school,\" said co-investigator Jeffrey Ratto, DrPH, Division of Violence Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, CDC.\"We know violence can be prevented. Schools, families, and communities can help prevent school violence and support students who experience school violence.

  "text": "More than any other recent event, the COVID-19 crisis has affected the lives of people around the world. In a special issue of the online journal Frontiers in Sociology, edited by sociologists from Constructor University and the Otto von Guericke University of Magdeburg, a group of researchers documents the global impact of the pandemic on the social cohesion of individual population groups and world regions.          Did the pandemic bring societies together or increase the drifting apart? That was one of the central questions posed by the scientists.\"The empirical knowledge gained in this special issue deepens our understanding of the social consequences of the pandemic,\" says Dr. Mandi Larsen, a sociologist at Constructor University, \"a well-founded scientific basis is also important in order to be able to better counteract future pandemics in socio-political terms.\"Together with her expert colleagues Dr. Georgi Dragolov and Prof. Dr. Jan Delhey from Constructor University and Otto von Guericke University of Magdeburg, she is responsible for the special issue. The trio also wrote the introduction to the special issue, published on May 10th, 2023.In nine articles, the authors examine the consequences of the pandemic and the restrictive measures that governments implemented to contain it. They discuss, for example, the effects on vulnerable groups, such as children, the elderly, and migrants in various countries worldwide. One study looks at ideological polarization in the course of the pandemic, using Austria as an example, while another looks at Corona deniers in Germany. Other articles analyze the significance of poverty or describe the experiences with the pandemic in Russia.What all studies have in common is that they focus on at least one of the three core elements of social cohesion, as outlined by the Bertelsmann Stiftung's Social Cohesion Radar, which was also developed by social scientists from the two universities: Social relationships, including loneliness; trust in institutions, especially political institutions; and the willingness to help and care for each other and to engage themselves for the common good.\"Social cohesion is the glue that holds our society together,\" says Mandi Larsen. \"This special issue provides a great deal of context to the state of research.\"The special issue, however, does not provide a straightforward answer to the question of whether the pandemic promoted togetherness or rather drove societies apart. That depends on the societal context, the measures put in place, and the phases of the pandemic, the sociologist says. \"A better understanding of this complexity is the key to developing long-term strategies for managing the social consequences of this and future pandemics.\" More information:Mandi M.

  "question_squad": " What does Sachs believe can help prevent biased decisions?",
  "answer_squad": " Surroundings",
  "text": "When interviewing a job candidate, people often have certain preferences that are not just based on a rational evaluation of the person's skills, but also on gut feelings. These feelings can be fed by our biases that develop subconsciously and automatically. They become problematic when they lead to exclusion or a disadvantage for specific groups, as is currently still the case with ethnic minorities. How can we deal with racial biases and avoid discrimination in the labor market?          \"In the last decades, companies have become more aware of discrimination and prejudice and are trying to do something about it,\" states behavioral scientist Tobi Sachs, who studies mechanisms leading to stereotyping and discriminatory behavior. \"But there is still a lot of evidence for prejudice and discrimination during recruitment and job evaluations.\"Sachs mentions studies in which researchers sent out letters to real job openings from fake applicants with different ethnic backgrounds. \"These studies very consistently show that minorities receive fewer responses to their applications while having equal skills.\" And he highlights that discrimination in organizations does not just occur at this hiring stage. \"Studies show that it is harder to get promoted for people with a minority background, and that people are still often stereotyped or mocked for their origin, and excluded from social networks in organizations.\"What companies have been doing so far to fight discrimination is clearly not enough, or is not taking the right tack. Sachs believes we can only tackle discrimination successfully when we take into account multiple factors at the same time: individual biases, the influence of social norms, and structural aspects such as company policies.Less information leads to more discriminationSachs combines lab experiments and field studies to investigate how and under which conditions racial biases affect decisions in organizations. Specifically, he studied how information is processed when evaluating job applications of ethnic minorities. For example, in an experiment he asked people to evaluate applicants for a vacancy. During the assessment, participants only received snippets of information, each time learning a little bit more about the candidate.\"We found that the chances of a good evaluation for minority candidates increased when participants received more information about the individual,\" says Sachs about the results of this experiment. \"That indicates that when people lack information, they fill this gap with assumptions about the candidate. And that's when stereotypes come into play.\"      Surroundings can help preventing biased decisionsSachs also examined the influence of social norms on discriminatory hiring decisions. \"There is a connection between personal biases and social norms. When participants of our study were reviewing a majority or minority job applicant, the minority applicant received particularly bad evaluations when the evaluator had cold feelings towards ethnic minorities and the organization was not diversity friendly. When only one of these was the case, minority evaluations were not that different from majority ones.\" This makes Sachs conclude that biases more likely lead to discrimination when the surroundings approve these biases. Or in other words, surroundings can contribute a lot to help prevent individuals from making biased decisions.Be aware of your own biasesSachs not only wants to understand the mechanisms leading to discrimination, but also develop interventions that can reduce biased decision making. \"The first step is to acknowledge that you too are affected by biases, and that others can help spot these. For example, it might help to rationalize your gut feeling when you're evaluating job applicants and explain your preference to others. Decisions that are prone to biases should always be made with a mixed team of people.\" If such basics are met, it is possible to look into more detailed explanations of undesired biases.An intervention that Sachs has been testing is the effect of displaying diversity and inclusion as a common goal. \"When everybody in an organization is aware of and supports the common goal of equal opportunities, people might start to believe that equal opportunities are actually possible, and they will be motivated to contribute to this goal. The right social norm can help to reduce discriminatory actions.\"Different perspectivesWe need to tackle discrimination from different perspectives at once, concludes Sachs. \"You can train decision makers to control their biases, but if their colleagues are prejudiced or organizational policies are biased, the decision makers' actions will still be prone to discrimination because the social and systemic influence is too strong. If we really want change with long-lasting effects, we have to tackle individual biases, social norms and organizational structures all together.\" Provided byUniversity of AmsterdamCitation:How can we break the racial bias in the labour market?

  "text": "A trio of physiologists at NTT Communication Science Laboratories, in Japan, has found that Formula 1 racecar drivers unintentionally time their blinking with straighter parts of the track. In their study, reported in iScience, Ryota Nishizono, Naoki Saijo and Makio Kashino fitted sensors to the helmets of three professional Formula 1 racecar drivers to monitor blinking.          Prior research has found that while it is possible to blink at will, for the most part, it is an unconscious behavior. Prior research has also found that the purpose of blinking is to clear away material on the surface of the eye and to keep the sclera and cornea moist.Other research has also shown that a secondary type of blinking occurs during unexpected events, such as in response to an oncoming projectile\u2014and some research indicates a link between blinking and concentration. In this new effort, the researchers looked into a possible example of this third type of blinking.To learn more about the blinking habits of racecar drivers, the researchers recruited three professional Formula 1 racecar drivers. Each had sensors affixed to their helmet that were able to detect blinking. Each of the drivers then drove at race speeds around a professional racecourse.The researchers found a pattern\u2014all three drivers tended to blink during safer parts of the course. Conversely, all three withheld blinking during critical parts of the course, such as when navigating turns or attempting to overtake a competitor.The researchers note that blinking while driving a racecar could lead to problems during critical moments, noting that blinking while driving (which lasts for just a fifth of a second) could mean driving in the dark for approximately 20 meters if driving at 354 km/h.The findings highlight the fact that blinking is part of the visual system and that it is very clearly done in a way that provides protection for the eyes while also providing protection for the body as a whole.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards employee monitoring?",
  "answer_race": " Critical.",
  "question_squad": " What is the most severe punishment?",
  "answer_squad": " prison sentence",
  "text": "Being tightly monitored by an employer when working from home, house arrest or a restraining order: according to researcher Hadassa Noorda, these are all forms of imprisonment. \"You can also be imprisoned without being behind bars.\"          A prison sentence is often seen as the most severe punishment, while Noorda says this is not always the case. She argues for a broader definition of imprisonment that looks primarily at the impact of a punishment. \"Something like wearing an ankle bracelet would be much less drastic, because then you can still participate in society. But you can't draw that line so firmly.\"Here, Noorda answers questions related to her latest research, published in the journal Criminal Justice Ethics.In your opinion, what is imprisonment?Liberty can be limited in different ways and to different degrees. I look at the impact of imprisonment: can someone still see their friends and family? Is there freedom of movement and can you still work, for example? Those freedoms can be affected both inside and outside of incarceration.For example, a restraining order can mean that you can no longer see certain people, and taking away your drivers license can result in having to quit your job. Such forms of deprivation of liberty I see as exprisonment; the new term I have coined. Imprisonment takes place not only behind bars, but also on the streets and in the home.Why is it important to stretch the definition of imprisonment?Its important because then you're talking about a different conceptual and legal framework. If you look at employee monitoring it is seen at most as an invasion of informational privacy, but if you see it as something that also has to do with depriving liberty it has different legal implications. I wrote about this with Jeevan Hariharan (Queen Mary University of London).In what sense is employee monitoring a form of imprisonment?Monitoring can restrict peoples' freedom. It can go quite far. For example, Teleperformance, one of the largest call center companies in the world, uses digital monitoring. Home workers are watched very closely.There are webcams with facial recognition, locations are monitored, activity on your keyboard is tracked, and you are not allowed to go to the bathroom in your own home without asking permission\u2014and if you do, your manager is notified. These kinds of systems can be very restrictive. You can even compare it to a certain kind of imprisonment. If this kind of system goes too far, you can argue that someone is chained to their desk for a certain period of time.Where do you think the concept of exprisonment should lead?The concept of exprisonment has now been adopted in philosophical and legal literature, including in the fields of criminal law, labor law and human rights. It shows that imprisonment can take place outside of prison, but also that one can be imprisoned to a certain degree and that there is no categorical difference between imprisonment and other measures.My first goal is to encourage thinking about imprisonment. We need to look closely at liberty deprivation that takes place on the streets and in the home, especially with the new technology. In the Netherlands, for example, especially since the pandemic, webcams are widely used to monitor home-based workers. The argument is: surely you have nothing to hide? But that doesn't hold water if you see it as a form of imprisonment in addition to a risk for the employees' control over information and data.

  "text": "Experts at the University of Stirling are calling for the arts and culture to be prioritized in funding decisions after new research showed the significance of cultural hubs during the COVID-19 pandemic.          A team led by Dr. Katherine Champion studied how arts organization, Creative Stirling, and the social enterprise, The Kitchen at 44 King Street, transformed their activities, mobilized their networks and redeployed their assets to provide for their local community during COVID lockdowns.Between March 2020 and October 2022 the organizations delivered creative packs for local children, distributed Christmas hampers to families, organized free online workshops to tackle social isolation and provided advice to those unable to work due to the pandemic, including local artists. The Kitchen at 44 King Street also set up Stirling Community Food\u2014offering excess food for free\u2014which was hosted in the Creative Stirling hub.Dr. Champion said, \"Creative Stirling and The Kitchen at 44 King Street played a vital role in supporting their local communities, collecting and re-distributing resources, sharing information and connecting with local people in need. Their activities were integral to people surviving and thriving during an unprecedented time of crisis.\"This offers an important example of the power and role of arts and culture in addressing social need during a time of crisis, which other arts and cultural organizations can learn from. Worryingly, however, in the current context of economic uncertainty linked to the cost-of-living and public funding crises, opportunities to learn and expand from this period could be undermined.\"The research, which included expertise from Dr. Maria Velez Serna and Dr. Susan Berridge also both of the University of Stirling's Faculty of Arts and Humanities, highlighted the challenges the cultural hub faced and have produced a number of recommendations for policy makers.Dr. Champion added: \"We need to look at how agencies, government and policy can help address the issues faced by cultural hubs, including access to funding and the physical spaces available to these organizations to operate from.\"There is a powerful conversation to be had about including arts from the get-go when talking about supporting communities. Arts and culture are still often seen as 'nice to have' or as an 'add-on' to areas of policy rather than being able to offer critical support right from the start\u2014we hope this research demonstrates the sector's significant role.\"The researchers' recommendations include designing appropriate funding mechanisms and support, giving more funding autonomy to community leaders who are attuned to local needs and protecting the physical spaces where cultural and creative hubs are housed.The team will share their findings at a workshop on 2 June at Creative Stirling. They also recently attended an event at the Scottish Parliament, where they met First Minister Humza Yousaf, and discussed their insights with other MSPs and cultural organizations.

  "text": "From the start of the pandemic, the general population faced several fears amidst the rising death toll, business shutdowns, circulating virus, and overall uncertainty of the future. At the same time, the federal government implemented several anti-immigration policies, such as the Public Charge Rule, which created an environment of heightened distress among families with and without U.S. citizenship.          In a study published in the journal Health Equity, Brittany Morey, Ph.D., MPH, senior author and assistant professor of health, society and behavior at the UC Irvine Program in Public Health, highlights the health inequities that were exacerbated during the height of the pandemic. This study shared experiences of families that included individuals with different citizenship or immigration statuses, known as mixed-status families.The Public Charge Rule is applied to non-citizens in the process of naturalization to determine if they will become dependent on certain government benefits, like cash assistance, in the future, which would make them a \"public charge.\" During the pandemic, this rule was slightly eased for extreme cases of need deemed credible by the federal government but it was not advertised widely. Therefore, many families, including those with U.S. citizen children, avoided using any COVID-19 assistance out of fear that it would jeopardize their family members' legal status in the future.Using in-depth, semi-structured interviews between February and April 2021, Stephanie Iraheta, corresponding author and a UCI Public Health Policy alumna, applied grounded theory to assess the level of awareness around the Public Charge Rule and the health challenges these families faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results from the interviews confirmed that the fear of repercussions from these anti-immigration policies affected mixed-status families' health and access to desperately needed resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.Key themes were pulled from the interviews around financial need, job insecurity, housing insecurity, food insecurity, mental health and distrust of government and health officials. Many COVID-19 resources were critical in surviving the pandemic, but the distrust in the government and fear of public charge rule stopped many mixed-status families from using them.\"It is clear that these anti-immigration policies had extremely harsh and detrimental effects on the lives of so many marginalized families,\" says Morey. \"Every individual in the U.S., regardless of immigration status, deserves to have their basic needs met during challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope our findings push equity-driven policies forward and make policymakers think twice before implementing bills that affect the health of our entire community.\" More information:Stephanie Iraheta et al, Mixed-Immigration Status Families During the COVID-19 Pandemic, Health Equity (2023).

  "answer_squad": " mastery",
  "text": "We all know that high levels of stress in the workplace can lead to burnout. But less attention is given to long periods of intense boredom, sometimes referred to as \"rust out\" or \"bore out.\"          This typically comes with feelings of weariness, distraction and a lack of motivation, alongside the perception of time slowing down. Despite this, it's a problem that many managers and organizations ignore.If burnout is the result of overly high levels of demand at work, then rust out is caused by overly low levels of demand or stimulation. When employees are bored and disengaged at work for extended periods of time, they might experience frustration and lethargy, lower psychological well-being and reduced job satisfaction.They may also feel unfocused, like they don't have a set goal or task. This state is in direct opposition to \"flow\"\u2014a sort of hyperfocus which occurs when one's skills are perfectly challenged (so a task isn't too easy or too hard). This is when it feels fulfilling to complete a task.Boredom is associated with reduced productivity and creativity, and increased counterproductive work practices\u2014including distraction, substance use and absenteeism\u2014just like burnout. Clearly, this is bad for the individual and workplace alike.Employees tend to become bored when their work is uninspiring and does not stretch their skills or abilities. Increasing levels of education means that the skills of employees now often exceed the requirements of their jobs. And in precarious times, such as the current cost of living crisis, people are more likely to accept jobs they are overqualified for, further exacerbating the possibility for workplace boredom.The increasing use of technology may have also induced a reduced sense of purpose or fulfillment. Industrialization and the introduction of the computer has clearly had a legion of advantages. But on the flip side, we are now further removed from the physical creation of products, leading to feelings of alienation.The COVID-19 pandemic has not helped either. During the lockdowns, and in the face of increased awareness of mortality, people used their time to examine what they really value in life. This in turn has led to a wave of quiet quitting, in which employees only do the bare minimum of what's required at work.But quiet quitting can be counterproductive because it often boosts boredom and leaves people without a sense of purpose or motivation.      Three pillars of workplace well-beingIn opposition to being bored, the state of flow fulfills three factors that some researchers suggest are the most important to workplace well-being: autonomy, mastery and purpose.Autonomy is the sense of control and freedom that employees feel when they have the power to make decisions about how they work and what they work on. Mastery is the sense of progress and growth that employees experience when they feel they are improving, developing new skills and conquering new challenges.And purpose is the sense of meaning and impact that employees experience when they feel that their work is contributing to something larger than themselves and has a positive impact on the world.What is common across these three factors is that they contribute to work feeling \"right\"\u2014that is, providing sense of satisfaction, fulfillment or purpose. When these three pillars are not met, this leads to a strong reduction in motivation, and ultimately disengagement from work.Another factor is motivation, which can typically be divided into two types. Extrinsic motivation encourages you to do something because there is an external reward, whether monetary or even just praise. Intrinsic motivation helps you stay motivated to keep doing something simply because you want to\u2014it brings you joy.The absence of intrinsic motivation is what leads to boredom in particular. It is a state where even extrinsic reward generally cannot bring back focus and engagement.Contemporary solutionsHow might we fight workplace boredom? While there are some considerations that have to be addressed, a four day work week and general flexible working tick many of the boxes.These give employees autonomy, provides them with time to devote to mastering new skills and seek out creative endeavors that give a sense of purpose. Together, this is a solid basis to support intrinsic motivation.Happy workers are not just productive workers, however, they are also more creative. If a company suffers from large groups of bored employees, as some reports have suggested, then it misses out on important innovations and consequent growth.Organizations that prioritize circumstances that encourage creativity\u2014through a positive work environment and good manager-employee relationships, for example\u2014have higher levels of productivity, competitiveness and overall performance through fostered innovation, problem-solving and adaptability.In order for employees to be creative and innovative, they need to be able to have time to engage in different tasks. Through their so-called Fedex days, Atlassian, an Australian software company, did just that: employees were able to do whatever they wanted for a day.Google and other companies implemented a similar strategy called the 20% rule, where employees are encouraged to spend up to 20% of their paid work time pursuing personal projects.Employees also need to feel positive and supported. A lack of energy or performance anxiety can get in the way of this.Boredom means that the current work situation does not present a challenge suitable for employees' skills, meaning that they will not experience a flow state, or satisfaction or fulfillment. Flow states can be very important for inducing creativity.Most people will experience boredom once in a while at work. But as long as it doesn't become all-consuming, it can even be rewarding. That's because occasional boredom can divert our attention in directions it might not normally go, or let our brain wander. This may ultimately lead to creative ideas and solutions.

  "question_squad": " What is the main reason that students react badly to communication about GCSE exams?",
  "answer_squad": " the language used",
  "text": "GCSE exams are under way and many students will be feeling the pressure to get the grades they need to pursue their education or employment goals.          They may be experiencing exam anxiety, which is linked to lower performance in exams and lower well-being.Teachers and parents want students to perform at their best and be emotionally well. So it's useful to know there are ways to encourage students and ease anxiety during this time\u2014and things to avoid saying.My colleagues and I have carried out research on the different things that teachers say to students about GCSE exams. We have found that the language used is important, and how students perceive communication about GCSEs has important consequences.What teachers say mattersSome students react badly to communication about GCSE exams when the messages are focused on the potential negative outcomes. For example, a teacher might say, \"If you do not work hard, you will not get into college.\" When teachers emphasize the risk of failing or not getting the grades they need, some students feel threatened, and this increases their anxiety and feelings of hopelessness about the exams.Students who react in this way to failure-focused messages usually value their GCSEs but do not feel capable of getting the results they need. After hearing messages like this, students may withdraw from study-related activities both emotionally and behaviourally, meaning that, for instance, they might not try hard in class. Research has found that they ultimately receive lower GCSE grades.Fortunately, teachers also have the power to encourage their students with their communications about exams. Emphasizing the possible positive outcomes that could result from exams, such as \"If you work hard, you will get the grades you need\" is a more beneficial route and might encourage students to be proactive in their preparation strategies.In 2023, GCSE exams run until June 21\u2014so students will be revising for some time yet. In light of our findings, if you are a parent trying to encourage your teenager to study, you could try pointing out the benefits of working hard, rather than the outcomes of failure.      Helping students to copeWhen students suffer from exam anxiety, they perform worse in exams, compared to students of the same ability. One explanation for this, supported by research, is that anxiety and thoughts of failure distract the student and place an additional load on their working memory during their exam. In effect, this uses up the cognitive capacity that could otherwise be used for remembering the required information.If your teenager holds unrealistic and negative self-beliefs, such as \"I will fail no matter how hard I try,\" simply telling them that everything will be okay is not particularly helpful. Instead, you could point out that if things do go wrong, they will be able to cope and respond effectively.There are options available if they do not do as well as they hoped\u2014for instance, they could retake their exams at a later date and gain some work experience in the meantime.You can also help your teenager to challenge their negative beliefs. You could ask them what evidence they have to support the beliefs and to think about times in the past when they succeeded rather than failed. If they continue to cite previous failures, you could point out that this may be because they have only been thinking about information that is consistent with their beliefs. Encourage them to replace their beliefs with more positive statements, such as: \"Chances are I probably won't fail.\" This has been shown to reduce exam anxiety.When people have anxiety, they try to avoid the things that make them anxious\u2014in this case, exams. This avoidance tendency can manifest in procrastination about revising and making less effort out of a fear of failure. This further increases exam anxiety.One way to help could be to encourage your teenager to reflect on their revision and preparation strategy. If they believe their approach to be ineffective, they could be helped to try a different method. When students feel more confident in their knowledge, their worries about exams reduce.Helping your teenager to learn relaxation techniques such as breathing exercises, muscle relaxation and guided visualization could also help to reduce the physiological symptoms of anxiety directly before, and during, the exam.Research has found that using the above strategies is effective in reducing exam anxiety in GCSE students.A further, very simple approach could be to ask students who are anxious about exams to write down their thoughts and feelings about the exam just before they take it. This might help to get distracting thoughts and emotions out of their minds. Writing worries down like this has been shown to reduce distress, as well as increase performance in exams in people who are highly anxious.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards integrated computing?",

  "question_squad": " What is the new approach to computer science education called?",
  "answer_squad": " integrated computing",
  "text": "Despite growing demand for computer science skills in professional careers and many areas of life, K-12 schools struggle to teach computer science to the next generation.          However, a new approach to computer science education\u2014called integrated computing\u2014addresses the main barriers that schools face when adding computer science education. These barriers include a lack of qualified computer science teachers, a lack of funds and a focus on courses tied to standardized tests.Integrated computing teaches computer science skills like programming and computer literacy within traditional courses. For example, students can use integrated computing activities to create geometric patterns in math, simulate electromagnetic waves in science and create chatbots for literary characters in language arts.As a professor of learning technologies, I have been designing integrated computing activities for K-12 students for the past five years. I work with faculty and students in teacher training programs to create and test integrated computing activities across all academic subjects.In my research, I have found that integrated computing solves three major hurdles to teaching computer science education in K-12 schools.Challenges to teaching computer scienceFitting a new academic discipline into an already crowded curriculum can be a challenge. Integrated computing allows computer science education to become part of learning in other classes, the way reading skills are also used in science, math and language arts classes.Teacher knowledge is another difficulty when it comes to teaching computer science in K-12 schools. While people who specialize in computer science are often recruited to more lucrative careers than teaching, integrated computing develops all teachers' computer science knowledge. Teachers do not need to become computer science experts to teach computer literacy and programming skills to their students.In fact, the most surprising result of my research is how quickly teachers learn to teach integrated computing activities. In about two hours, teachers can use a pre-made computer science lesson in their classrooms. In the future, I will teach them to use artificial intelligence to create their own lessons for their students. For example, a science teacher recently asked me how she could create a data analysis activity for her class. AI tools would allow her to quickly design the technical aspects of this activity.And finally, integrated computing also addresses students' reluctance to take elective computer science classes when they have little knowledge of computer science. In 2022, over half of U.S. public high schools offered computer science, but just 6% of students took these classes. Students who do take computer science in high school typically have had early exposure to computer science. Integrated computing can give all students early exposure to computer science, which I believe will increase the number of students who take computer science courses later in school.Computer science for everyoneEarly exposure to computer science in school is especially important for students from groups underrepresented in computer science. A 2022 report from Code.org, a nonprofit that advocates for more computer science education in K-12 schools, found that students who are Latino, female or from low-income or rural areas are less likely to be enrolled in foundational computer science courses.Teachers who want to build their computer science knowledge and apply it to their classroom can try these free self-paced, online integrated computing courses that I developed, and which are tied to micro-credentials. Also, this sortable list of integrated computing activities provides free lesson plans. The activities require only a computer\u2014no prior knowledge is needed, and young learners can complete them outside of class, too.Integrated computing provides a path to increase computer literacy for all K-12 students. As technology advances at an increasing rate, I believe schools must take care that our young people do not fall behind.

  "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become such a part of our daily lives that it's hard to avoid\u2014even if we might not recognize it.          While ChatGPT and the use of algorithms in social media get lots of attention, an important area where AI promises to have an impact is law.The idea of AI deciding guilt in legal proceedings may seem far-fetched, but it's one we now need to give serious consideration to.That's because it raises questions about the compatibility of AI with conducting fair trials. The EU has enacted legislation designed to govern how AI can and can't be used in criminal law.In North America, algorithms designed to support fair trials are already in use. These include Compas, the Public Safety Assessment (PSA) and the Pre-Trial Risk Assessment Instrument (PTRA). In November 2022, the House of Lords published a report which considered the use of AI technologies in the UK criminal justice system.Supportive algorithmsOn the one hand, it would be fascinating to see how AI can significantly facilitate justice in the long term, such as reducing costs in court services or handling judicial proceedings for minor offenses. AI systems can avoid the typical fallacies of human psychology and can be subject to rigorous controls. For some, they might even be more impartial than human judges.Also, algorithms can generate data to help lawyers identify precedents in case law, come up with ways of streamlining judicial procedures, and support judges.On the other hand, repetitive automated decisions from algorithms could lead to a lack of creativity in the interpretation of the law, which could result slow down or halt development in the legal system.The AI tools designed to be used in a trial must comply with a number of European legal instruments, which set out standards for the respect of human rights. These include the Procedural European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice, the European Ethical Charter on the use of Artificial Intelligence in Judicial Systems and their Environment (2018), and other legislation enacted in past years to shape an effective framework on the use and limits of AI in criminal justice. However, we also need efficient mechanisms for oversight, such as human judges and committees.Controlling and governing AI is challenging and encompasses different fields of law, such as data protection law, consumer protection law, and competition law, as well as several other domains such as labor law. For example, decisions taken by machine are directly subject to the GDPR, the General Data Protection Regulation, including the core requirement for fairness and accountability.There are provisions in GDPR to prevent people being subject solely to automated decisions, without human intervention. And there has been discussion about this principle in other areas of law.The issue is already with us: in the US, \"risk-assessment\" tools have been used to assist pre-trial assessments that determine whether a defendant should be released on bail or held pending the trial.One example is the Compas algorithm in the US, which was designed to calculate the risk of recidivism\u2014the risk of continuing to commit crimes even after being punished. However, there have been accusations\u2014strongly denied by the company behind it\u2014that Compas's algorithm had unintentional racial biases.In 2017, a man from Wisconsin was sentenced to six years in prison in a judgment based in part on his Compas score. The private company that owns Compas considers its algorithm to be a trade secret. Neither the courts nor the defendants are therefore allowed to examine the mathematical formula used.      Towards societal changes?As the law is considered a human science, it is relevant that the AI tools help judges and legal practitioners rather than replace them. As in modern democracies, justice follows the separation of powers. This is the principle whereby state institutions such as the legislature, which makes law, and the judiciary, the system of courts that apply the law, are clearly divided. This is designed to safeguard civil liberties and guard against tyranny.The use of AI for trial decisions could shake the balance of power between the legislature and the judiciary by challenging human laws and the decision-making process. Consequently, AI could lead to a change in our values.And since all kinds of personal data can be used to analyze, forecast and influence human actions, the use of AI could redefine what is considered wrong and right behavior\u2014perhaps with no nuances.It's also easy to imagine how AI will become a collective intelligence. Collective AI has quietly appeared in the field of robotics. Drones, for example, can communicate with each other to fly in formation. In the future, we could imagine more and more machines communicating with each other to accomplish all kinds of tasks.The creation of an algorithm for the impartiality of justice could signify that we consider an algorithm more capable than a human judge. We may even be prepared to trust this tool with the fate of our own lives. Maybe one day, we will evolve into a society similar to that depicted in the science fiction novel series The Robot Cycle, by Isaac Asimov, where robots have similar intelligence to humans and take control of different aspects of society.A world where key decisions are delegated to new technology strikes fear into many people, perhaps because they worry that it could erase what fundamentally makes us human. Yet, at the same time, AI is a powerful potential tool for making our daily lives easier.In human reasoning, intelligence does not represent a state of perfection or infallible logic. For example, errors play an important role in human behavior. They allow us to evolve towards concrete solutions that help us improve what we do. If we wish to extend the use of AI in our daily lives, it would be wise to continue applying human reasoning to govern it.

  "question_squad": " What is the average amount of research funds per grant for men?",
  "answer_squad": " US$659,000",
  "text": "It likely comes as no surprise that women receive a smaller share of research funding than men. But untangling the underlying reasons is no small feat.          A recently published international review spanning 45 years found that women accounted for just under a quarter of awards.But our own study of 48,061 grants awarded in Australia by the Australian Research Council and National Health and Medical Research Council over 20 years points to a complex issue that extends beyond granting systems: fewer women researchers mean fewer women applicants, in turn leading to fewer women receiving grants.The international sceneIn the recent international review, the authors synthesized evidence from 55 studies from 14 countries including the United States and Canada, and the European Union, from 1975 to 2020. Their analysis explored gender differences in grant award outcomes, success rates and funding amounts.They found, on average:fewer awarded grants were led by women (24%) than men (76%)30% of applicants were women. Success rates for grants led by women (23%) did not differ significantly from those led by men (24%)women researchers received about half the amount of research funds per grant than men\u2014an average of US$342,000 compared to men with an average of US$659,000. But this international analysis only incorporated one year of Australian data, limiting the degree to which those findings might pan out here.What about Australia?We, the research team at the Office of the Australian Government's Women in STEM Ambassador, deployed a statistical model that enabled us to detect nuanced patterns by simultaneously considering not only gender, but also career seniority, field of research and time. This research is currently available as a preprint ahead of peer review.Echoing findings of the international study, our modeling revealed fewer awarded grants were led by women than men. However, we also found that career seniority mattered\u2014increasingly fewer women researchers received grants at a senior level. The percentage of grants led by women was 39% among early-career, 33% among mid-career, and 26% among senior-career researchers.We also found that gender differences in awarded grants varied by field of research. Proportionally fewer awarded grants were led by women in the fields of chemical sciences, mathematical sciences, Earth sciences, technology, engineering and physical sciences.We documented progress towards gender parity over the 20-year period, and the rate of progress depended on career seniority. The percentage of awarded grants led by senior-career women increased by 11% in the span of 20 years, reaching 31% in 2020. The increase was 8% for mid-career and 4% for early-career women researchers.However, progress is slow and remains well below parity.Importantly, we found that success rates for grants led by women did not differ significantly from men's success rates. Based on this, we conclude it's unlikely the main source of gender disparities in grant outcomes is how the research is assessed.Unlike the findings from the international review, we found that funding amounts didn't differ by gender. Women-led grants in Australia were awarded the same amount of funding per grant as men-led grants.That said, because fewer awarded grants were led by women, the total funds showed a substantial difference: A$19.1 billion awarded to men lead investigators versus A$7.5 billion awarded to women lead investigators.      What about the workforce?It is important to place these gender differences in the context of research workforce participation. According to available Australian data, there are fewer women than men in the research workforce. In fact, for every 100 men researchers, there are only 75 women researchers on average.When we considered the number of awarded grants relative to workforce participation, we found the award rate was actually higher for women than men, especially among senior career researchers. For every 1,000 women professors in the research workforce, 11 led a successfully funded grant each year; whereas for every 1,000 men professors, six led a successfully funded grant each year.Despite award rates apparently favoring women over men (note the workforce data are not as comprehensive as our grant funding data), fewer women researchers mean fewer women applicants, which means fewer women awardees overall.Pulling all this together, it seems gender differences in Australian research grant programs may primarily arise from unequal workforce participation.What can we do?We need to support women entering the research workforce and ensure they remain there and can progress in their careers. Barriers to women's workforce participation have been extensively documented. The responsibility to remove such barriers rests with several entities.Higher education and research institutes have social and legal responsibilities to provide environments in which all researchers have an equal opportunity to excel. In Australia, Science in Australia Gender Equity provides an accreditation framework to identify and address inequities and can accelerate the increase of women in leadership positions.Governments and research funders can incentivise these and other gender-equity initiatives. Options include mandating workplace gender targets, equity plans or relevant accreditation as a condition of receiving government funds. These approaches are shown to progress gender equity.Only when the whole sector comes together to contribute solutions across the research ecosystem will we see genuine, sustainable progress towards gender equity.

  "text": "Violent extremism has been on the rise in recent years. This trend poses a global threat to international peace and security. But how do people end up as violent extremists?          An international team of researchers has analyzed this question through six studies. The researchers conclude that violent extremism largely grows out of a sense of cultural threat. This is especially true for people with specific personality traits.\"The Muhammad cartoons are one of many examples of how the perception of cultural threat can lead to violent extremism and promote black-and-white thinking,\" says Milan Obaidi, Associate Professor at the Department of Psychology.He is leading the research project, which is based on large amounts of population data from Denmark, France, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The study also includes data on Muslims from over 20 countries.Seeking definitive answers and solutionsThe researchers have focused particularly on jihadist extremism. There are several reasons for this.\"Firstly, countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan are heavily affected by terrorism, but there is limited psychological research on the causes of violent extremism among non-Western populations,\" says Obaidi:\"Second, terrorists claiming to act in the name of Islam have fueled widespread fear and suspicion of Muslims and the Islamic faith. this has led to harmful stereotypes and linked jihadist extremism with Islamic values.\"While right-wing intolerance and violent extremism are often attributed to individual personalities, Jihadist violent extremism is commonly generalized to people sharing a specific culture or religion.\"By adopting a personality approach, our research sheds light on how Muslim violent extremism, similar to other forms of intolerance in Western cultures, may be influenced by individual traits,\" explains Obaidi.The researchers highlight the human need for definitive answers and solutions to complex problems as a key explanation for why a sense of cultural threat can lead to extremist behavior. The psychological phenomenon is called 'Need for Cognitive Closure'\u2014NFC.\"NFC is linked to our craving for structure, predictability and decisiveness. Individuals with high levels of NFC tend to find relative values unpleasant and adhere to black-and-white, authoritarian and dogmatic beliefs,\" explains Obaidi, elaborating:\"Extremist groups can respond to the need for clarification by offering a simplified, black-and-white narrative of the world and a solution to perceived threats. Here, violence and terrorism can be presented as the only solutions to cultural threats\".Can arise in all culturesAccording to Obaidi, NFC is a psychological mechanism that resides in people across groups and cultures.\"We could find the same results in other extremist environments by threat imagery. This could be Western right-wing extremists who perceive their status, power and group dominance as threatened by minorities and immigration,\" he mentions.Obaidi hopes that the study can both raise awareness of the processes behind violent extremism and also help to limit its spread.\"It would be obvious to provide information on how, for example, language use can be perceived as a cultural threat\u2014in order to make risk groups less exposed to what they perceive as threatening. At the same time, our results underline the need for more constructive dialogue, where definitive answers and solutions are not allowed to dominate,\" he concludes.The study is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the software that is able to help companies make strategic decisions about their employees?",
  "answer_squad": " AI-driven software",
  "text": "Whether we realize it or not, advancements in artificial intelligence are increasingly influencing the paths of our careers.          Advancements in human capital management systems, more strategic and data-driven human resource and talent management practices, and increased attention to bias are all factors that are changing how people are hired, developed, promoted and fired.I teach and work in talent management and leadership development. I've used these programs and practices in the real world and continue to learn and research how these practices are changing. Artificial intelligence and systems are already big business, grossing over US$38 billion in 2021. Without a doubt, AI-driven software has the potential to advance quickly and change how companies make strategic decisions about their employees.Here's what that acceleration may mean to you.ApplyingImagine you apply for a job in the very near future. You upload your carefully written r\u00e9sum\u00e9 through the company website, noting that the platform looks eerily similar to other platforms you've used to apply for other jobs. After your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is saved, you provide demographic information and complete countless fields with the same data from your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. You then hit \"submit\" and hope for a follow-up email from a person.Your data now lives within this company's human capital management system. Even if they collect them, very few companies are looking at r\u00e9sum\u00e9s anymore; they're looking at the info you type into those tiny boxes to help make comparisons between you, dozens or hundreds of other applicants, and the job requirements. Even if your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 demonstrates that you are the most qualified applicant, it alone is unlikely to catch the eye of the recruiter, because the recruiter's attention is elsewhere.      Getting the jobLet's say you get the call, you ace the interview and the job is yours. Your information hits another stage within the company's database, or HCM: active employee. Your performance ratings and other data about your employment will now be tied to your profile, adding more data for the HCM and human resources to monitor and assess.Enhancements in AI, technology and HCMs enable HR to look at employee data on deeper levels. The insights gleaned help identify talented employees who could fill key leadership roles when people quit and guide decisions about who should be promoted. The data can also identify favoritism and bias in hiring and promotion.As you continue in your role, data on your performance is tracked and analyzed. This may include your performance ratings, supervisor's feedback, professional development activity\u2014or lack thereof. Having this large amount of data about you and others over time now helps HR think about how employees can better support the growth of the organization.For example, HR may use data to identify how likely specific employees are to quit and evaluate the impact of that loss.Platforms that many people already use every day aggregate productivity data from sign-in to signoff. Widely available Microsoft tools including Teams, Outlook and SharePoint can help provide insight to managers via their workplace analytics tool. The Microsoft productivity score tracks overall usage within the platform.Even the metrics and behaviors defining \"good\" or \"bad\" performance may change, relying less on the perception of the manager. As data grows, even the work of professionals like consultants, doctors and marketers will be quantitatively and objectively measured. A 2022 New York Times investigation found that these systems, designed to improve worker productivity and accountability, had the effect of damaging morale and instilling fear.It's clear that American employees should begin to think about how our data is being used, what story that data is telling, and how it may dictate our futures.Optimizing and understanding your careerNot every company has an HCM or is advanced in using talent data to make decisions. But many companies are becoming savvier and some are incredibly advanced. At a recent Microsoft Viva summit I attended, chief human resources officers from companies like PayPal and Rio Tinto outlined ways they are using these advancements.Some researchers claim that AI could promote equity by removing implicit bias from hiring and promoting, but many more see a danger that AI built by humans will just repackage old issues in a new box. Amazon learned this lesson the hard way back in 2018 when a r\u00e9sum\u00e9-sorting AI it built had to be abandoned when it favored men for programming roles.What's more, the increase of data collection and analysis can leave employees unclear on where they stand while the organization is very clear. It's best if you understand how AI is changing the workplace and demand transparency from your employer. These are data points that employees should consider asking about during their next review:Do you see me as a high-potential employee?How does my performance compare with others'?Do you see me as a successor to your role or others'?Just as you need to master traditional aspects of workplace culture, politics and relationships, you should learn to navigate these platforms, understand how you are being assessed, and take ownership of your career in a new and more data-driven way.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards the use of LLMs?",

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the company that is testing an OpenAI-powered chatbot?",
  "answer_squad": " Morgan Stanley",
  "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are shaking up the world of finance. Morgan Stanley is testing an OpenAI-powered chatbot to assist their financial advisors. The bot, trained on the bank's own research reports, offers rapid access to their extensive proprietary knowledge base.          Private equity firms and insurers were also early adopters, using these innovations for pre-screening investments and automating claims. As LLMs steadily diffuse throughout the finance industry, we need to thoughtfully embrace and adapt to this game-changing shift.Substitutes or complements?Against this backdrop, it's natural to wonder if finance professionals could become obsolete. However, this apprehension arises from a simplistic view of AI as a substitute for humans. Large language models should not be seen as a replacement for skilled professionals, but rather as a powerful tool that can enhance their abilities.By complementing human expertise with AI-driven insights, tools like ChatGPT can help financial professionals make better decisions, automate mundane tasks, and stay ahead of the curve in an increasingly competitive market.Both a productivity booster and an equalizerContrary to the common association of innovation with inequality, early evidence suggests that adopting LLM-enabled technologies has leveled the playing field at work.In call centers of large software companies, chatbots improved the productivity and quality of underperforming workers more than that of \"superstars.\"In a separate study, researchers conducted experiments and found that ChatGPT substantially improved the productivity of university-educated professionals in writing tasks, particularly benefiting the slower writers.Lower cost, higher demand?With this boost in productivity comes the potential to reduce the cost of providing services. This increased efficiency allows financial professionals to focus on high-value activities, such as client relationship management and strategic decision-making.Moreover, as technological innovations like LLMs make financial services more affordable and accessible, the demand for these services could grow due to their newfound affordability and accessibility, ultimately leading to an increased need for financial professionals.Revolutionize knowledge sharing and flatten the organizational structureThe rise of interactive LLMs democratizes access to knowledge. These AI models allow people of all computer literacy levels to tap into vast repositories of information. Moreover, by using this technology to mine emails, recorded discussions, and other resources, we can facilitate seamless sharing of organizational \"know-how.\" This can reduce the need for specialization and prompt a re-evaluation of traditional organizational structures.Instead of viewing such AI as substitutes for human workers, we must recognize their potential to reduce service costs and increase demand for financial services. By making professional advice more accessible, we could create a world where many more financial professionals are needed.How should professionals prepare?To prepare for the impact of large language models, finance professionals (and professionals in other industries) should focus on cultivating organizational AI literacy. Here are some steps to consider:Encourage entry-level professionals to use models like ChatGPT, providing training to help them understand the technology's strengths and limitations. Develop a strategy to turn institutional \"know-how\" and culture into easily accessible information with the assistance of LLMs.Anticipate initial impacts on work efficiency and quality, addressing any discontent among \"superstars\" who might not benefit as much from the technology.Rethink team organization, taking advantage of decreased specialization requirements to create more versatile and adaptive structures.Alleviate apprehension about AI by highlighting its potential to improve overall productivity and job satisfaction.Ultimately, the integration of LLMs into the finance sector has the potential to revolutionize the way that professionals access and share knowledge. By embracing AI and adapting to its implications, finance professionals can secure their place in a rapidly evolving industry.

  "answer_squad": " Wolf of Wall Street",
  "text": "We all like to think of ourselves as rational human beings. If there's a drastic change in our lives or at work, we can evaluate our options and make the best choice. But James Summers, an expert in team management and adaptation at Iowa State University, says our ability to process information breaks down when we experience heightened negative emotions.          Fear and anxiety can lead to withdrawal and avoidance, both of which hinder a group's ability to coordinate and overcome challenges. Because of this, many researchers who study organizational behavior, human resource management, applied psychology and communications have viewed negative emotions as counterproductive.\"Everything in the 'work teams' literature says emotion needs to be managed or regulated. But it gets to the point where you are in a situation where you are not going to be able to do that. So, how can we take something debilitating and switch it to get people to act and be successful,\" says Summers, associate professor of management and the Max S. Wortman, Jr. Professor.In a newly published paper, Summers and his co-author, Timothy Munyon, professor of management at the University of Tennessee, argue that negative emotions\u2014if leveraged in the right way\u2014can help teams adapt. They make their case by dissecting scenes from three blockbuster movies, each of which represent a different type of team and threat.'Braveheart' and 'Remember the Titans'The 1995 film \"Braveheart\" portrays William Wallace during the First War of Scottish Independence from England. During a critical plot point, the Scottish forces face a larger, better equipped English army at Stirling. The underdogs are ready to withdraw until Wallace intervenes.Summers and Wortman point out Wallace first uses humor to gain the soldiers' attention. He then reinforces a shared identity (sons of Scotland) before legitimizing their fear and appealing to their higher shared values.\"Aye, fight and you may die. Run, and you'll live, at least a while. And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for that one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!\"Through his impassioned speech, Wallace shifts the soldiers' fear to outward anger, which carries the Scottish forces to victory.\"We know anger clouds our ability to cognitively process. We sort of narrow in, but that's not necessarily a bad thing all the time, especially in situations like this,\" says Summers. \"Have you ever been mad and had a great workout?\"He adds that it's easier to move from one \"negative\" emotion to another.\"You're not going to take someone who's fearful and make them happy. But you can play in the same sandbox of emotions,\" Summers explains.\"Remember the Titans\" also features a team transitioning from negative emotions that are non-functional to functional. The 2000 movie chronicles the story of an American high school football team during desegregation. In one of the scenes, the players argue about who will start and how much time they'll have on the field. Coach Boone steps in with an emphatic argument that they are one team with the same goal. \"Perfection\" becomes their rallying cry and helps the players move from within-fighting to cooperation.      'Wolf of Wall Street'The \"Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013) illustrates how teams can fail to leverage negative emotions. The movie follows the story of Jordan Belfort and his New York-based stock brokerage, which ran a fraudulent pump-and-dump scheme. With mounting pressure from the FBI, Belfort's father and attorney encourage him to step down from the company and make a deal.Belfort agrees with the plan, but when he sees his distraught team during a farewell speech, he reverses course and says he isn't leaving. He shifts their first emotion (sadness) to another (enthusiasm), which provides temporary relief. But the decision to stay eventually leads to the company's downfall.The authors write: \"Although he rationally understood the necessity of adaptation, we contend that Belfort's emotions led him to self-deception where he persuaded himself to maintain the status quo.\"Recommendations for teamsSummers says all teams face disruptions at some point\u2014a critical member leaves, a project loses funding or gets shut down, businesses merge and leadership changes. It's normal to experience fear, anger, anxiety or sadness during a transition.\"For so long, the old adage has been, 'It's just a job' or 'Do your job.' It's only been within the last few years that workplaces are beginning to accept the role of emotions,\" says Summers. \"We all need to understand the full range of emotions that people in the workplace experience.\"To help teams adapt to disruptions and find long-term success, Summers says his top recommendation is to pay attention.\"If someone withdraws or is having a bad day, don't ignore it or shrug it off\u2014acknowledge it. Only then can you help them shape that emotion into something that's functional,\" he adds.As part of his ongoing research, Summers is studying the effects of speaking up in a team (e.g., how it can make team members feel included or generate conflict.) He's also investigating risk factors for employee theft and whether tattoos hurt someone's chance of getting hired.The paper is published in the journal Academy of Management Review.

  "text": "How do Quebec-born children in mixed families with one Muslim parent self-identify? How do they combine the different values transmitted by their parents and those of the society in which they grow up?          These are some of the questions that led Josiane Le Gall, an assistant professor of anthropology at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, to conduct a qualitative study with colleagues in religion, social work, anthropology and psychology at UdeM, Universit\u00e9 Laval and Morocco's Al Akhawayn University.The findings were published last August in a special issue of the journal Social Compass on how Muslim / non-Muslim families around the world navigate identity and religious issues in their daily lives and the social constraints they face.Le Gall's research grew out of a larger study on plural identity in about 100 people of mixed ethnicity in Quebec. She interviewed 23 people aged 18 to 40 with one Muslim immigrant parent. The Muslim parents came from Morocco, Tunisia, Lebanon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Senegal, Guinea, Egypt, Gambia and Bangladesh. Two-thirds were non-practicing.Quebecers first and foremostLe Gall found three different patterns of cultural transmission in the subjects' families: total absence of any cultural transmission, explicit transmission of identity markers (language and/or culture), and exposure to cultural references (the religion was not actively transmitted but cultural and religious practices were present in the home).Participants were unanimous in saying they identified first and foremost as Quebecers and, to a lesser degree, as Canadian, regardless of whether the non-Muslim parent was born in Quebec or elsewhere.\"They were influenced above all by the place they were born; this is where they feel at home,\" said Le Gall. \"School and the friendships they formed shaped their identities more than anything else.\"At the same time, most of them were also attached to the cultural heritage transmitted to them by their immigrant parent.\"They claim a plural identity that combines cultural influences from the immigrant and non-immigrant parent,\" explained Le Gall. \"As the expression goes, they're 100-per-cent mixed.\"Limited transmission of language and religionGrowing up in a multi-ethnic home has shaped these individuals in many ways. They have a connection to the cultural and culinary traditions of their Muslim parent's native country, but in many cases little or nothing of the Muslim parent's religion and language was passed down to them.The majority of the subjects reported speaking French at home, and some spoke English.\"As adults, some regretted that their parent hadn't taught them Arabic or other native language and made an effort to learn it,\" Le Gall noted. \"They would have liked to be able to speak it, especially when visiting relatives in their immigrant parent's country of origin.\"Religion was an important dimension of identity for the handful of subjects whose parents were both practicing Muslims. The others said they had been exposed to some Islamic rituals but generally did not practice Islam or any other religion.\"Having been born in Quebec, they exhibited a certain reticence, if not indifference, about religion in general,\" commented Le Gall.Plural identity is enrichingIt was in early adulthood that many of the subjects felt a stronger desire to claim their Muslim parent's cultural markers. \"As teens, they were more likely to reject or minimize the importance of their minority culture, \" said Le Gall.In most cases, their identification with the minority culture was rooted mainly in their daily experiences and practices with their immigrant parent, rather than knowing the language and religion or having the nationality.\"While the identities constructed by the subjects varied widely, they all felt that their mixed cultural identity was enriching, not limiting,\" said Le Gall. \"They reject any rigid, predefined notion of identity and can easily reconcile the different facets of their identity, which they do not see as incompatible in any way.\" More information:Josiane Le Gall et al, Family transmission and identity construction: The perspective of 'mixed' individuals with a Muslim parent in Quebec, Social Compass (2022).

  "text": "Investors could benefit if they had timely information about non-income tax deals, according to new research from The University of Texas at Austin that finds companies that get them have higher future stock returns.          In 2022, U.S. corporations reaped more than $19 billion in non-income tax megadeals: state and local tax breaks worth $50 million or more. That's according to Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks tax subsidies for corporate facilities.Unfortunately, investors don't get such information. Accounting rules do not require companies to disclose the deals in financial statements. By the time they make it into GJF's database, they're often months or years old.\"What we show in this paper couldn't be a viable real-time trading strategy,\" said Brady Williams, associate professor of accounting at the McCombs School of Business. \"This paper highlights the inadequacy of the information environment around non-income taxes.\"With Michael Drake of Brigham Young University, Ryan Hess of Oklahoma State University, and Jaron Wilde of the University of Iowa, Williams analyzed tax incentive deals from GJF's database. Covering 1,031 state and local governments from 2003 to 2016, the researchers found:For companies that got tax breaks, sales the following year were 9.6% higher than for comparable companies that did not.Tax breaks boosted their stock returns 4.1%, compared with companies that did not get them.It's not clear whether the tax breaks helped generate the higher sales and returns, Williams said. He noted that governments tend to award them to companies whose prospects are already bright.\"A major company comes to a city or county and says, 'We have financing secured, we think we have the demand, and we're willing to back that up with hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in your jurisdiction,'\" he said. \"That's essentially a signal of private information that the market might not be privy to at the moment.\"Should companies be required to disclose non-income tax deals in their financials? Not necessarily, Williams said. Making such deals public too soon might discourage governments from offering them and remove one lever they can use to stimulate the local economy.\"The results suggest that (investors) could make more informed trading decisions if they had access to this information,\" he said.

  "text": "Researchers from Newcastle Business School, The University of Newcastle, and UNSW Business School, University of New South Wales, have published a new paper in the Journal of Consumer Psychology that provides a comprehensive review of consumer research journals from both marketing and non-marketing disciplines.          By identifying gaps in the literature, the paper offers guidance for those seeking to further progress consumer research.The article is authored by Edwin Camilleri, Nitika Garg, and Shah Jahan Miah.A thriving field of study, consumer research provides relevant source material on vast range of issues studied across multiple disciplines, including choice and decision processes, lifestyle and culture, health and wellness, and existing and new technologies. Previous reviews of consumer research focused exclusively on journals, articles, and authors in the marketing field\u2014but not on the impact or citation frequency of specific topics from both \"inside\" and \"outside\" the marketing field.The authors identified emerging, declining and the most impactful topics in both between 1999 and 2019. Based on a review of literature during that period, the authors found that non-marketing journals focusing on consumer research has continually increased, particularly since 2055, while the number of marketing journals publishing consumer research has remained relatively consistent.Through a five-step process of data collection, topic modeling and analysis, the team discovered that several topics from non-marketing disciplines have grown significantly in terms of coverage and citations. For example, topics such as food waste, technology, and sustainability reflect emerging contemporary issues pertinent to consumers. Marketing scholars have taken interest and are applying various marketing concepts and theories to these subjects, adding fresh scholarship to the field.The authors propose topics for future research based on subjects common \"inside\" consumer psychology literature that haven't yet been explored in relation to the topics of emerging interest in other fields. These \"gaps\" include self-regulation, consumption experience and giving behavior.The authors also identified the Journal of Consumer Psychology and the Journal of Consumer Research as two of the marketing journals at the forefront of cutting-edge consumer psychology research.Given that the study concluded in 2019, the authors note that marketing scholars are also now considering a range of consumer relevant issues in the wake of the pandemic, which will add additional breadth and stimulate new perspectives to the field.

  "question_squad": " How many sexual assaults were recorded on NHS premises between 2017 and 2022?",
  "answer_squad": " 35,606",
  "text": "A joint investigation published today by The BMJ finds that NHS trusts recorded more than 35,000 cases of rape, sexual assault, harassment, stalking, and abusive remarks, between 2017 and 2022. The findings, which show that NHS trusts are failing to protect staff and patients, have led to calls for an independent inquiry.          The data, based on responses to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests from 212 NHS trusts and 37 police forces in England, show that a total of 35,606 sexual safety incidents were recorded on NHS premises over this five year period.At least 20% of incidents involved rape, sexual assault, or kissing or touching that a person did not consent to, although not all trusts provided a breakdown of the type of incidents recorded. The other cases included sexual harassment, stalking, and abusive or degrading remarks.The data also show that patients are the main perpetrators of abuse in hospitals. Most incidents (58%) involved patients abusing staff, with patients abusing other patients the next most common type of incident (20%).Police recorded nearly 12,000 alleged sexual crimes on NHS premises in the same time period. These include 180 cases of rape of children under 16, with four children under 16 being gang raped.Yet the investigation found that fewer than one in 10 trusts has a dedicated policy to deal with sexual assault and harassment, and are no longer obliged to report abuse of staff to a central database.Latifa Patel, BMA workforce and equalities lead, says she assumes that trusts without dedicated sexual safety policies are \"sitting on huge numbers of unreported incidents,\" which she describes as \"a truly disturbing implication.\"The data show that 193 of the 212 trusts reported 10 or fewer staff-on-staff incidents between 2017 and 2022, but doctors describe this as \"implausible\" given their numbers of employees, and say that staff are reluctant to report sexual assault.Simon Fleming, an orthopaedic registrar and author of Sexual Assault in Surgery: a Painful Truth, said, \"I know hundreds of female doctors who've been assaulted, thousands who've been harassed, and a decent number who've been raped within the NHS.\"And although more than 4,000 NHS staff were accused of rape, sexual assault, harassment, stalking, or abusive remarks towards other staff or patients in 2017-22, the investigation found that only 576 have faced disciplinary action.What's more, when complaints are made against colleagues, women claim that NHS trusts show a \"reluctance to suspend perpetrators due to overall staff shortages,\" says Deeba Syed, senior legal officer for Rights of Women, a helpline that provides support for women who have been sexually assaulted or harassed at work.The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, the Liberal Democrats, the Hospital Doctors Union, the GMB union, the Society of Radiologists and the British Dietetic Association have all called for an independent inquiry into the epidemic of sexual assault in the NHS in light of the findings.Fleur Curtis, 43, was sexually assaulted on three occasions by a junior doctor in 2016 and 2017 when she was working as a physician associate at the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford. She told The BMJ that the trust's poor handling of her complaint had a massive impact on her mental health, forcing her to quit her job in 2020.      So what can trusts do?Trusts need to be guided by NHS-wide policies on how to deal with allegations, including when to suspend staff and when to report individuals to the police, and should act swiftly to deal with complaints, say Tamzin Cuming and Carrie Newlands, from the Working Party on Sexual Misconduct in Surgery.Others agree that action is needed fast. \"Employers must ensure that victims are supported and feel empowered to report sexual harm and resolve to take appropriate action,\" adds Patel. \"It is heartbreaking to see the extent to which the NHS has failed to provide this safety to patients and healthcare staff.\"Health secretary Steve Barclay said that the government has doubled the maximum sentence for those who are convicted of assaulting health workers and is working closely with NHS England to prevent and reduce violence against staff.In a linked opinion article, Simon Fleming says it is everyone's responsibility to hold sexual predators in the NHS accountable or risk becoming complicit bystanders. \"Criminal behaviour should be dealt with seriously, regardless of who has committed the crime,\" he argues. \"Failure to challenge, individually or organisationally, these attitudes is akin to accepting them as 'just how things are.'\"In another opinion article, Rosalind Searle at the Adam Smith Business School, University of Glasgow, says failures to record, investigate, and act on cases of sexual harassment and abuse in healthcare have enabled perpetrators. She outlines three sanctioning mechanisms\u2014self, social, and legal sanctions\u2014that are needed to reduce these violations in workplaces and society.

  "text": "Support among military veterans for extremist groups and extremist ideals appears similar to or less than levels seen among the U.S. public in general, despite fears that it could be higher, according to a new RAND Corporation report.          Surveying a nationally representative group of military veterans, researchers found that support for extremist groups such the Proud Boys and Antifa was generally lower than rates derived from previous representative surveys of the general U.S. population.Assessing support among veterans for extremist beliefs, researchers found results that were more mixed. Support for QAnon was lower than the public at large, while support for political violence and the Great Replacement theory appeared similar to that of the general population.The survey found that veterans of the Marine Corps expressed the highest support for extremist groups and beliefs among the different branches of military.\"We found no evidence to support the notion that the veteran community, as a whole, exhibits higher rates of support for violent extremist groups or extremist beliefs than the American public,\" said Todd C. Helmus, the study's lead author and a senior behavioral scientist at RAND, a nonprofit research organization. \"However, our findings do suggest work still may be needed to make sure veterans are not susceptible to being recruited by those with extremist ideologies.\"Concern that the veteran community is at increased risk of radicalization to violent extremism has increased since reports that a significant proportion of the people who attacked the U.S. Capital on Jan. 6, 2021, were currently or had been affiliated with the U.S. military.Several factors are assumed to underpin radicalization of veterans and why some extremist groups have sought to target both active-duty and military veterans. Veterans are considered significant additions to violent extremist groups, given their past weapon training and their logistic and leadership skills. They also lend a sense of legitimacy to militant groups that can further aid recruitment.In addition, the veteran population is more male and more White than the overall U.S. population, demographic factors that are associated with right-wing (and to some degree left-wing) extremism in the United States, according to researchers.      To better understand the issue, RAND researchers conducted the first nationally representative survey of veterans' views about extremism and extremist groups.Researchers surveyed a group of veterans from the NORC AmeriSpeak panel, analyzing responses from 989 people who reported that they previously served on active duty, but were not currently doing so.Participants were asked about extremist groups such as Antifa, the Proud Boys and white supremacist groups, as well as their attitudes toward QAnon ideology, support for political violence and the xenophobic Great Replacement theory.Considerably fewer veterans expressed support for Antifa than the overall U.S. population (5.5% versus 10%), and veterans expressed much lower support for White supremacists than the U.S. population overall (0.7% versus 7%). Veterans also expressed relatively less support for the Proud Boys (4.2% versus 9%) and the QAnon conspiracy theory (13.5% versus 17%). About 5% of the participants expressed support for Black nationalist groups.Despite these encouraging findings, support for the necessity of political violence (17.7 versus 19%) and support for the Great Replacement theory (28.8% versus 34%) were similar to support in the U.S. population. Only a minority of the veterans who expressed support for extremist groups also endorsed the need for political violence.Researchers found that Marine Corps veterans reported the highest levels of support for Antifa, the Proud Boys and Black nationalists, as well as the highest levels of support for political violence and the Great Replacement theory. Both Air Force and Marine Corps veterans reported stronger support for QAnon.\"Given the anecdotal information about extremist group recruitment preferences and their active targeting of veterans, we would have assumed that these reported prevalence rates would be higher,\" Helmus said.Researchers say it could be that veterans who support such groups may be more inclined to actually join them or participate in their activities than nonveteran counterparts. Hence, even a smaller prevalence rate of extremist attitudes among veterans could still represent an outsized security threat to the United States.\"It seems clear that veterans bring a unique and dangerous set of capabilities to extremist groups,\" said Ryan Andrew Brown, co-author of the study and a RAND senior behavioral scientist. \"So even a smaller prevalence rate of extremist attitudes among veterans could still represent an outsized security threat to the United States.\"Researchers suggest that the U.S. military and veteran service organizations should continue to explore what drives some active-duty personnel and veterans to endorse extremist beliefs and join extremist causes. Such efforts should include both additional survey work and interview-based studies that would help researchers understand the factors that drive radicalization.

  "text": "Nineteen percent of respondents to a survey of academics report that they or someone they know have witnessed unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP)\u2014observations of the sky that cannot be identified as aircraft or as known natural phenomena\u2014and 37% report some degree of interest in conducting research into UAP.          The findings, which are based on a survey of 1,460 US academics, are published in Humanities and Social Science Communications and highlight that many academics consider the evaluation of UAP to be worthy of academic scrutiny.Marissa Yingling, Charlton Yingling and Bethany Bell surveyed professors, associate professors, and assistant professors from 144 US universities across 14 academic disciplines in 2022. The survey was sent to 39,984 academics and the response rate was 4%. Participants, who were 62% male and 80% white, were asked about their perceptions of, experiences with and opinions of UAP. Of the 14 different disciplines represented, 10% of participants worked in political science, 10% worked in physics, 10% in psychology and 6% in engineering.Nineteen percent of participants (276) reported that they or someone they knew had witnessed UAP and a further 9% (128) reported that they or someone they knew may have witnessed UAP. Thirty-nine percent of all participants reported that they did not know what the most likely explanations for UAP were, while 21% attributed them to natural events and 13% to devices of unknown intelligence.Although only 4% of participants reported that they had conducted academic research related to UAP, 36% (524) reported some degree of interest in conducting research in this area. 43% said they would be more likely to conduct academic research into UAP if a reputable scholar in their discipline did so and 55% said they would be more likely to conduct research into UAP if they could secure funding.Thirty-seven percent of participants ranked the importance of further research into UAP as very important or absolutely essential, while 64% considered academia's involvement in UAP-related research to be very important or absolutely essential.The findings suggest that many US academics across disciplines consider academia's involvement in research into UAP to be important and may be cautiously willing to engage with research into UAP, particularly if others they consider to be reputable within their field do so. The authors suggest that open discussions of UAP among academics could enable greater academic involvement in UAP-related research.However, they note that further surveys in larger and more diverse cohorts are needed to investigate attitudes towards UAP more generally among academics in the U.S..

  "text": "Researchers from Fudan University's School of Management have published a new paper in the Journal of Consumer Psychology that provides original insights about the impact different types of feedback consumers have on consumers' psychological state.          Specifically, the research examines \"piecemeal\" feedback informing consumers of their progress or performance during each step of an online process such as making a purchase, playing a computer game, or customizing a product. The work compares intermittent feedback with \"lump sum\" feedback offered at the end of a process.The article is authored by Haichao Lin, Qian Xu, and Liyin Jin, and offers a deeper understanding of how external factors impact consumers' internal experience. Previous research has focused on how feedback reinforces consumer behavior but not on how different types of feedback affect consumers' mindset and subsequent actions.The authors found that intermittent feedback helped consumers connect their actions to progress toward a goal. This association generated a sense of impatience compared to those who only received lump sum feedback at the completion of a goal. For example, piecemeal feedback such as \"You have completed Step 1 in this customization, please proceed to Step 2\u2026\" provides consumers with the satisfaction of accomplishing an action. This reward boosts their motivation to quickly complete the next, generating greater impatience.Through a series of five studies, the research team found that regular feedback forms a strong, reliable action-outcome association, spurring consumers to pursue prompt results in subsequent related or unrelated situations.\"This effect is robust regardless of whether the valence of feedback is positive or negative, whether the outcome involves gain or loss, and whether the form of feedback is monetary or informative,\" the authors found.The timing of piecemeal feedback is significant. The researchers discovered that piecemeal feedback increases consumer impatience only when it is provided at a fixed pace (rather than at a varied schedule) and immediately following specific behaviors that are directed toward action (rather than inaction).The researchers propose several avenues for future research related to their findings, including whether the effect of piecemeal feedback on consumer impatience holds if consumers are told beforehand about the feedback procedure. Given that the team measured consumer impatience immediately after receiving feedback, they suggest future studies could delay such measurement to explore how long the activated action-outcome persists.

  "text": "Forward markets\u2014over-the-counter marketplaces that set the price of a financial instrument or asset\u2014are used to trade a variety of instruments, including securities and commodities. In a new study, researchers measured the extent to which forward prices and spot prices (the current market price at which a given asset can be bought or sold for immediate delivery) agreed in markets with transaction costs in California, studying time periods before and after the state introduced financial trading to its wholesale electricity market in 2011.          The study found that allowing trading in this market led to a reduction in the implicit cost of trading day-ahead/real-time price differences, the volatility of these price differences, and the volatility of real-time prices. In addition, operating costs and fuel use fell on days after the introduction of purely financial participation.The study, by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and Stanford University, is published in American Economic Journal: Economic Policy.\"Our results have important implications for the design of wholesale electricity markets with large shares of intermittent renewable resources,\" says Akshaya Jha, assistant professor of economics and public policy at CMU's Heinz College, who led the study.Forward markets are believed to aggregate information about future spot prices and reduce the cost of producing the commodity. But it has been difficult to link increases in forward market liquidity to reductions in production costs due to the long time period over which most commodities are produced and traded. To examine changes in forward-spot price convergence after the implementation of financial trading, researchers measured the 24-dimensional vector of hourly average day-ahead prices at a location in the transmission network versus the 24-dimensional vector of hourly average real-time prices at the same location.Using this model, they computed two measures of implied transaction costs using hourly, location-specific data on day-ahead and real-time prices from April 1, 2009, to November 30, 2012, before and after financial trading began at most pricing locations in California. The California Independent System Operator introduced financial participation on February 1, 2011, to reduce differences between day-ahead and real-time prices at more than 4,000 locations in the state's transmission network.The study found that both measures fell substantially after California introduced purely financial participation. In addition, both measures fell more at locations where trading was restricted prior to the introduction of financial trading. This suggests that allowing financial trading resulted in day-ahead prices that better reflect real-time conditions.      The study's findings also suggest that physical market outcomes improved as a consequence of the better information encapsulated in day-ahead prices after financial trading. Namely, they show that residualized fuel cost per megawatt hour (MWh) of gas-fired output and input fuel use per MWh of gas-fired output fell after financial trading was introduced on days when the complexity of the real-time market-clearing problem was high, but not on days when complexity was low; again, indicative of the importance of improved day-ahead information.The results remained similar regardless of whether complexity was measured using daily total demand, the daily standard deviation across locations and hours in real-time prices, or the total number of daily starts. The study's authors estimated that fuel costs per MWh fell 2% after the introduction of financial trading on high-demand days relative to low-demand days. This would result in an average $16.6 million reduction in annual total fuel costs.As the share of electricity demand in a region grows, system operators are often required to impose more operating constraints on day-ahead and real-time markets to maintain the balance between supply and demand throughout the day. Controllable generation resources with positive startup costs are also likely to fluctuate more frequently because intermittent renewables can start and stop producing with very little notice. Rising transmission network constraints are also likely to bind as the percentage of electricity production from wind and solar resources distributed across the grid increases.\"The location-specific bids and offers submitted by purely financial participants can reduce day-ahead/real-time price differences caused by uncertainty in intermittent renewable output,\" explains Frank Wolak, professor of economics at Stanford University, who co-authored the study. \"These financial bids and offers can also ensure that the least-cost combination of controllable resources is available to compensate for fluctuations in real-time output from intermittent renewables on high-complexity days.\" More information:Akshaya Jha et al, Can Forward Commodity Markets Improve Spot Market Performance?

  "text": "Researchers from Texas A&M University's Mays Business School, Harvard University's Harvard Business School and University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business have published a new paper in the Journal of Consumer Psychology that provides novel insights about how consumers make trade-offs between experience quality and togetherness.          The paper offers sheds new light on the choices people make when presented with the option of improving an activity separately (with first-class airline tickets, for example) or sharing that experience in nearby physical proximity with a \"close other\" such as a romantic partner, dear friend, or family member.The article, \"A desire to create shared memories increases consumers' willingness to sacrifice experience quality for togetherness,\" is authored by Ximena Garcia-Rada, Michael I. Norton, and Rebecca K. Ratner.The research team found that consumers prioritize physical togetherness with relationship partners over opportunities that would improve an experience in real time. For instance, a couple in a movie theater would choose to sit together in the front row, craning their necks, rather than take two non-adjacent seats in rows with better views for both.A desire to \"create shared memories\" drives this behavior, according to a pilot study and five experiments conducted by the team. This dynamic is more pronounced when a consumer and their partner are offered \"asymmetrical\" or different experience qualities\u2014with one person receiving a better quality option than the other. In contrast, the authors found that people are less likely to sacrifice experience quality when they are with someone to whom they do not feel close.In one experiment conducted in a university behavioral lab, the authors discovered that students chose to eat two chocolates together with a friend rather than four chocolates they each could consume apart. In another study, more participants chose two adjacent seats very far from the stage over two non-adjacent seats close to the stage when asked to imagine attending a Cirque du Soleil performance with a close friend as opposed to a casual acquaintance.In marketing-based experiment, the team found that framing an activity as functional rather than pleasurable increased the likelihood that close partners would choose a higher-quality experience over togetherness. Specifically, to some participants, researchers described a train ride as a fun part of an excursion. To others, they positioned it as a utilitarian part of an excursion that would get them to their destination.\"More participants accepted a free upgrade\u2014even though it would require sitting apart from their companion\u2014when they perceived the activity as utilitarian, because they cared less about creating shared memories during the train ride,\" the authors said.These findings convey important insights for marketers seeking to fill airplanes, concert halls, amusement parks and other consumer experiences.Additionally, the authors suggest \"marketers can increase uptake by reassuring consumers that they can create shared memories even if apart.\" More information:Ximena Garcia\u2010Rada et al, A desire to create shared memories increases consumers' willingness to sacrifice experience quality for togetherness, Journal of Consumer Psychology (2023).

  "text": "If there's one thing we should all be able to agree on, it's that all human beings belong to the same species, Homo sapiens.          But a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) on Monday has found a yawning gap between what people claim to believe and what they actually hold true.A team from Harvard and Tufts gathered data from more than 60,000 subjects who took part in 13 experiments that tested their implicit biases.An overwhelming majority\u2014over 90 percent\u2014explicitly stated that white people and non-white people are equally human.But on an implicit measure, white US participants, as well as white participants from other countries, consistently associated the attribute \"human\" (as opposed to \"animal\") with their own group more than other racial groups.Conversely, Black, Asian and Hispanic participants showed no such bias, equally associating their own group and white people with \"human.\"\"The biggest takeaway for me is that we're still grappling in a new form with sentiments that have been around for centuries,\" first author Kirsten Morehouse, a Ph.D. student at Harvard University, told AFP.Throughout history, the dehumanization of other races has been used as a pretext for unequal treatment, ranging from police brutality all the way to genocide.Implicit Association TestThe research relied on the Implicit Association Test (IAT), a tool developed in the 1990s and now widely used in the field.A computer-based measure, it tests the strength of associations between two concepts\u2014for example Black and white people or gay and straight people\u2014and two attributes like good or bad.The idea is that easier pairings, as measured by faster key responses, are more strongly associated in the mind than difficult pairings, as measured by slower responses.Researchers believe IAT tests reveal attitudes that people would be unwilling to state publicly, or might not even be aware of on a conscious level.Across all the experiments, 61 percent of white participants associated white people more with \"human\" and Black people more with \"animal.\"An even greater number\u201469 percent of white participants\u2014associated white participants more with humans and Asians more with animals, and the same result occurred for white people taking a white-Hispanic test.These effects held true across age, religion and education of participants, but did vary by political affiliation and gender. Self-identified conservatives and men expressed slightly stronger implicit \"human = white\" associations.Non-white people did not show an implicit bias in favor of their own racial groups compared to white people.But they did show a bias towards whites as more human when the test was between white people and another minority group, for example Asians asked to take a test that assessed their attitudes towards white people versus Black people.Social hierarchyMorehouse attributed these findings to the fact that white people are socially and economically dominant in the United States, where 85 percent of the participants were from (8.5 percent were from Western Europe).She theorized that while you might expect all races to be more biased in favor of their own \"in-group,\" such sentiments might be canceled out by their lower standing in American society, resulting in overall neutrality.The fact that \"third party\" participants were biased in favor of white people when assessed against another race \"demonstrates how powerful these social hierarchies are,\" she said.Similar tests to those used in the experiment are available to take at implicit.harvard.edu/Morehouse said that while the results could be uncomfortable for some, awareness was a first step that could help individuals break patterns of stereotyping.

  "text": "Illustrations of scientific experiments play a fundamental role in both science education and the dissemination of scientific knowledge to the general public. Confirming the adage that \"a picture is worth a thousand words,\" these depictions of famous experiments remain in the minds of those who study them and become definitive versions of the scientific process. Archimedes in the bath discovering the law of buoyancy; Newton refracting sunlight with a prism and defining the principles of modern optics; Mendel cultivating peas and laying the foundations of genetics\u2014these are just a few well-known examples.          Many of these depictions convey false information, either because the experiments never actually happened or because they were performed quite differently. People who try to reproduce them on the basis of what the illustrations depict might not get any results at all or could even face dangerous consequences.A study conducted by Breno Arsioli Moura, a researcher at the Federal University of the ABC (UFABC) in S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil, has investigated depictions of one of these famous experiments, in which Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) flew a kite to draw electricity from a thundercloud.An article on the study is published in the journal Science & Education.Franklin was one of the leaders of the American Revolution and the first United States Ambassador to France. He was a Deist, a Freemason, and one of the most renowned personifications of the Enlightenment in the eighteenth century. His many interests included religion, philosophy, politics, and moral and social reform, and he was one of the foremost inventors and scientists of his time.\"The kite experiment is Franklin's most famous scientific achievement. In the article I analyze seven illustrations of the event published later on, in the nineteenth century,\" Moura told Ag\u00eancia FAPESP.In fact, he added, the kite experiment was designed to be a simpler version of another experiment Franklin thought up in 1750 and which is now known as the \"sentry box\" experiment. \"A kind of sentry box was to be set up on top of a tower, steeple or hill, and a man would stand inside it on an insulating dais made of wax, with a long, sharply pointed iron rod measuring some 10 meters inserted into it. Franklin expected the tip of the rod to 'draw fire' from the clouds. If the experimenter brought his knuckles close to the bottom of the rod, he would produce sparks,\" Moura said.\"It's important to note two things. The experiment wasn't to be performed during a storm to take advantage of lightning strikes, and the rod wasn't to be earthed but anchored by the insulating stand so that all the electricity extracted would be stored in it.\"Franklin's proposal stayed on paper until a highly similar experiment was performed by French researchers in 1752. Its success drew even more international attention to his work on electricity. \"When he heard about the French experiment, Franklin wrote to a correspondent in England that a simpler version of the experiment had been performed in Philadelphia, where he lived. This was in fact the kite experiment,\" Moura said.      The kite consisted of a \"small cross made of two light strips of cedar, the arms so long as to reach to the four corners of a large thin silk handkerchief when extended,\" Franklin wrote. A \"very sharp-pointed wire\" was tied to the \"top of the upper stick of the cross, rising a foot or more above the wood.\" The principle was the same as in the sentry box proposal. A key was fastened to the end of a silk ribbon, which in turn was tied to the end of the string (silk is an insulator).\"The experimenter held the apparatus by the silk ribbon so that electricity drawn down 'silently' from the clouds by the kite and conveyed along the string was stored in the key. As in the sentry box experiment, the kite was insulated, not earthed. By approaching a finger or knuckle, the experimenter could draw sparks,\" Moura explained.Like other eighteenth-century natural philosophers, Franklin thought of electricity as a fluid built up and then discharged, flowing from one place to another. This fluid could be obtained in the laboratory by rubbing a glass tube with a piece of leather and stored in a Leyden jar, invented in mid-century by Dutch scientists. The general idea behind the sentry box and kite experiments was to show that the fluid could also be drawn from the clouds. Franklin was fascinated by the physics of cloud electrification and other aspects of meteorology.For example, he thought seawater was full of electric fluid, and that when it evaporated to form storms high above the ocean, it took this fluid with it, so that the clouds were full of electricity.\"In Franklin's writings, there are no details showing whether he or someone else performed the experiment, but it does appear to have taken place. Another account of the experiment was produced 15 years later, in 1767, in a book by Joseph Priestley entitled 'The History and Present State of Electricity.' Franklin helped Priestley obtain materials for the book and is therefore assumed to have agreed with its contents. Priestley's account is far more detailed and includes participation in the experiment by Franklin's son. However, it differs from the original 1752 account on several points,\" Moura said.In his study of the illustrations depicting Franklin's kite experiment, Moura argues that they were based on Priestley's account. Many show Franklin with his son as a small boy even though at the time he was actually 21. Some also contain more important errors.\"Many show the experiment being performed in the open air even though Franklin specified that the experimenter must be in a 'door or window, or under some cover, so that the silk ribbon may not be wet,' which would make it conductive. In most cases, the kite is being struck by lightning, or lightning bolts are very near it, although Franklin did not want to draw a lightning strike down upon himself. Most illustrations don't show the silk ribbon that was meant to insulate the kite. Franklin simply holds the string. If that had been the case, he would have earthed the kite and ruined the experiment. One illustration shows Franklin holding the key near or on the string, which isn't warranted by any account,\" Moura said.The illustrations should not be used indiscriminately, especially in science classes, he argued. They embody messages that can be construed in a confusing or wrong manner, both historically and scientifically, if they are not treated critically. As noted at the outset, the images stay in the mind of the viewer and any errors they foster are hard to eradicate.

  "text": "Researchers from Seattle University's Albers School of Business and Economics, and the Indian School of Business have published a report that provides novel insights about how consumers make decisions about keeping or disposing of possessions they no longer need.          The article, \"Bracing for the sting of disposal: Product purgatories encourage mental simulation of the disposal process,\" recently published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology, is authored by Matthew S. Isaac, and Poornima Vinoo.Spring cleaning, moving homes and decluttering closets can be fraught with difficult decisions about what to keep and what to discard. Marie Kondo, a famous tidying consultant recommends keeping an item only if it sparks joy\u2014easier said than done for many people.\"It's not just clinical hoarders who end up with too much stuff,\" the authors write. \"Even otherwise well-functioning adults have the tendency to retain products that have outlived their usefulness.\"The research team offer a strategy to help consumers avoid the accumulation trap and finally jettison no-longer-needed items. The researchers found that moving an item to a \"purgatory\" or transitional space, such as a storage unit or a basement, facilitates the process of disposal.In one behavioral experiment, the researchers asked participants to think of an infrequently used item in their kitchen. One set of participants sent researchers a photo of the item in its current location. The other group was asked to move the item to a storage space or basement and send a photo of the item in this new location. When researchers then offered to connect all participants with an organization that would help them dispose of the product, participants who had moved the item to a purgatory were much more likely to dispose of the item than those who had not.In two additional studies, the authors found that moving an item to a transitional space led consumers to mentally envision its permanent removal, which made it easier to ultimately let go. In other words, imagining disposal allowed consumers to psychologically brace themselves for the eventuality of parting with the item forever.Previous research explored ways to make product owners feel less attached to their items so that they would be more open to giving them up. This new work offers another way to move from mentally envisioning disposal to making it a reality.The authors conclude that \"by helping them declutter, product purgatories might even be able to improve consumers' psychological well-being and spark their joy.\" More information:Mathew S.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the research that combines mentalism and behaviorism?",
  "answer_squad": " Integrated Preference Argumentation",
  "text": "Consumer purchasing decisions can be considered as a form of preference-based human reasoning. There are two major schools of thought on preference. While mentalism asserts that preference reflects the true mental state of a person, behaviorism is the view in which preference is considered as a mathematical construct.          According to behaviorists, people's actions and not words are decisive in determining their preferences. Economists foster this behavioral preference of consumers with Revealed Preference Theory (RPT), also known as consumer theory.As reasoning is involved in preference, it is instructive to generalize RPT to artificial intelligence (AI), currently dictated by mentalism.With this forethought, Professor Van-Nam Huynh from Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST) and Assistant Professor Nguyen Duy Hung from Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology, Thammasat University, Thailand, have recently generalized consumer theory to AI reasoning using argumentation\u2014a kind of reasoning that draws inspiration from the process of people exchanging arguments to reach conclusions in daily life.In an article published in the International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, the researchers present the theoretical foundation and analytical tools for practical applications of argumentation in analyzing consumer mentalism and behavior.Prof. Huynh highlights the novelty of their work, \"This paper bridges two lines of research: AI argument-based reasoning and behavioral economics. In particular, it explores the relationships between economic rationalities and argumentation semantics, between consumer's preference and AI agent's preference, and between consumer's purchasing behavior and AI agent's reasoning behavior.\"In this work, the contributions of the researchers are three-fold. They first developed a Revealed Preference Argumentation (RPA) framework. The researchers argued that the existing frameworks are governed by the opposing mentalistic interpretation of preference. Thus, they re-constructed and unified two main approaches to RPT in terms of argumentation, demonstrating that RPT-based consumer analyses, including different rationality checks of a consumer behavior and extrapolations of such behaviors, can be interpreted as computational tasks in RPA.Following that, the researchers successfully integrated mentalism and behaviorism to present an Integrated Preference Argumentation (IPA) framework. They established that RPA is just a special case of IPA with only 'revealed' preference. This finding is particularly important as existing preference-based argumentation frameworks are presented as IPA frameworks with only 'stated' preference.Finally, the researchers developed comprehensive IPA algorithms, rigorously establishing their accuracy and termination for a general class of IPA frameworks. The researchers successfully implemented the algorithms in Prolog\u2014a logic programming language associated with AI and computational linguistics\u2014and obtained an IPA reasoning engine. Subsequently, they tested the developed tool to effectively analyze RPT-based consumer behavior.In summary, this work makes remarkable inroads to a largely unexplored area in consumer behavioral economics. \"This paper not only provides a theoretical and algorithmic foundation but also development tools for applications of argumentation to behavioral economics in consumer's behavior analyses such as rationality checks, consumer's preference recoveries, and behavior extrapolations,\" notes Prof. Huynh.

  "text": "Married people who have affairs find them highly satisfying, express little remorse and believe the cheating didn't hurt their otherwise healthy marriages, finds a new report on the psychology of infidelity.          The extensive survey of people using Ashley Madison, a website for facilitating extramarital affairs, challenges widely held notions about infidelity, particularly about cheaters' motivations and experiences. The work is newly published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior.\"In popular media, television shows and movies and books, people who have affairs have this intense moral guilt and we don't see that in this sample of participants,\" said lead author Dylan Selterman, an associate teaching professor in Johns Hopkins University's Department of Psychological & Brain Sciences who studies relationships and attraction.\"Ratings for satisfaction with affairs was high\u2014sexual satisfaction and emotional satisfaction. And feelings of regret were low. These findings paint a more complicated picture of infidelity compared to what we thought we knew.\"Researchers conducted this study to better understand the psychological experiences of those who seek and engage in extramarital affairs. Working with researchers at the University of Western Ontario, Selterman surveyed nearly 2,000 active users of Ashley Madison, before and after they had affairs.Participants were asked about the state of their marriage, about why they wanted to have an affair, and about their general well-being. Respondents, generally middle aged and male, reported high levels of love for their partners, yet low levels of sexual satisfaction.Participants reported high levels of love for their spouses, yet about half of the participants said that they were not sexually active with their partners. Sexual dissatisfaction was the top-cited motivation to have an affair, with other motivations including the desire for independence and for sexual variety. Fundamental problems with the relationship, like lack of love or anger toward a spouse were among the least-cited reasons for wanting to cheat.Having great marriages didn't make cheaters any more likely to regret affairs, the survey found. Participants generally reported that their affair was highly satisfying both sexually and emotionally, and that they did not regret having it.The results suggest that infidelity isn't necessarily the result of a deeper problem in the relationship, Selterman said. Participants sought affairs because they wanted novel, exciting sexual experiences, or sometimes because they didn't feel a strong commitment to their partners, rather than because of a need for emotional fulfillment, the report found.\"People have a diversity of motivations to cheat,\" Selterman said. \"Sometimes they'll cheat even if their relationships are pretty good. We don't see solid evidence here that people's affairs are associated with lower relationship quality or lower life satisfaction.\"Selterman hopes to advance this work by looking closer at how other populations of cheaters compare to the Ashley Madison population.\"The take-home point for me is that maintaining monogamy or sexual exclusivity especially across people's lifespans is really, really hard and I think people take monogamy for granted when they're committed to someone in a marriage. People just assume that their partners are going to be totally satisfied having sex with one person for the next 50 years of their lives but a lot of people fail at it. It doesn't mean everyone's relationship is doomed, it means that cheating might be a common part of people's relationships.\" More information:Dylan Selterman et al, No Remorse: Sexual Infidelity Is Not Clearly Linked with Relationship Satisfaction or Well-Being in Ashley Madison Users, Archives of Sexual Behavior (2023).

  "answer_squad": " Leadership meta-skills",
  "text": "Leadership meta-skills should be developed in the public sector, according to Marika Tammeaid's doctoral dissertation from the University of Vaasa, Finland. These skills would serve as an antidote to harmful bureaucratization and help siloed administrative sectors to succeed in collaborative governance.          Essential meta-skills for any public sector leader are learning-to-learn, a systems approach extending beyond one's own organization towards ecosystem building, a dialogical way of interacting, the ability to enhance thinking from multiple perspectives, putting things into practice with a human focus, and an enabling leadership approach utilizing diversity and supporting self-organization.According to Tammeaid, who will publicly defend her doctoral dissertation at the University of Vaasa on Friday, May 26, intertwined social problems, reduced predictability and the pluralism of society are challenging public sector leadership and traditional public administration decision-making. Finding new solutions requires both solution-oriented cooperation between the administrative branches and involving the rest of society in co-creating new solutions.Tammeaid's doctoral research in the field of social and health management shows that investing in good leadership is not only crucial for employees and organizations but also directly impacts the public sector's capacity for renewal, the quality and human-centeredness of public policy, and the ability of the public sector to deliver good services to citizens.\"Meta-skillful leadership helps to approach the multifaceted social issues simultaneously from different administrative sectors and weave together the horizontal networks of collaborative governance,\" says Tammeaid.\"Silos hindering the phenomenon- and human-centered way of functioning can be not only political and structural but also mental by nature,\" notes Tammeaid. \"Meta-skills can act as an antidote for overcoming the dysfunctions of bureaucracy and hierarchy.\"A new perspective on reforming public leadership\"My dissertation combines scholarly knowledge on learning and change with scholarly traditions on public sector leadership. By doing so, it provides a new viewing angle and new solutions to the growing complexity challenges facing public administrations,\" says Tammeaid.Her research is qualitative and interdisciplinary. Semi-structured interviews with senior civil service leaders serve as important source material, shedding light on the leaders' own thoughts about the importance of meta-skills in succeeding in coordinative public tasks.Previous research literature has primarily examined the impact of complexity and the conditions for citizen participation in municipal and regional administration. Tammeaid's doctoral dissertation complements the previous research literature from the point of view of less researched central administration and specifically the viewpoint of senior civil servant leaders.Leadership meta-skills are learnable and teachableThe dissertation reveals that public sector leadership meta-skills have been discussed very little in the research literature and, if they have, mainly from a problem-oriented and externally evaluative perspective and as individual traits. However, Tammeaid's doctoral research emphasizes that public leadership is foremost about succeeding together. Therefore, it would be important to move on from a leader- and position-centric view of leadership.\"It is far more fruitful to look at leadership as a social process\u2014a social process that builds a platform for cooperation and gathers different skills and resources together to build new solutions,\" stresses Tammeaid. \"With this, we also build reciprocity and trust, two crucial elements of collaboration.\"Tammeaid's dissertation highlights that public leadership need to be developed in a way that helps address the complexity challenge.\"Different people with different strengths can succeed in demanding leadership roles, but it requires an understanding of the significance of meta-skills. Opportunities for developing meta-skills should be consciously provided, for example in leadership training. Leadership meta-skills offer a concrete and directly applicable way to address the current challenges of the public sector.\" More information:Dissertation pdf: osuva.uwasa.fi/handle/10024/15490Provided byUniversity of VaasaCitation:New research highlights the importance of meta-skills for public sector leadership (2023, May 22)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-highlights-importance-meta-skills-sector-leadership.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the most played video game in history?",
  "answer_squad": " Minecraft",
  "text": "Minecraft is officially the most played video game in history. Despite been 12 years old, the public does not seem to have lost interest: over 175 million people play Minecraft at least once a month. The number of players of this open-world or sandbox building game, which provides virtually unlimited possibilities for creation, keeps growing, and this is to a great extent thanks to its educational potential. According to Microsoft data, Minecraft Education Edition has over 35 million game licenses. And this is just one of the many ways in which it can be used for learning.          But what is the true educational potential of commercial video games? And how can they be used as tools at the service of teachers? This is the background on which the thesis written by Ferran Adell, a researcher and member of the Faculty of Computer Science, Multimedia and Telecommunications of the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) and head of the YouTube Video Games and Education project, is based.The thesis, which is supervised by David Casacuberta, a faculty member at the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, and Javier Melench\u00f3n, who is also a member of the UOC's Faculty of Computer Science, Multimedia and Telecommunications, has developed a method to help teaching staff establish which video games can help them achieve their aims in the classroom.The challenge of using video games for educationThe idea of using video games in educational contexts is not a new one. However, their popularity has shot up in the last decade thanks to their educational potential, their high acceptance by students and the increasing number of teachers who are gamers themselves. But, in spite of this growing interest, teaching staff still encounter many problems when it comes to using video games in the classroom. These challenges relate mainly to choosing which video game to use based on their aims and the educational context.\"The main hindrances are usually related to a lack of knowledge about this medium. Taking a video game out of its natural environment, which is that of leisure, and using it in an educational environment requires in-depth knowledge of the medium,\" explained Ferran Adell.\"If a teacher can't spend the time playing and experimenting with a video game before using it in the classroom, they may come across technical problems or unforeseen issues that they hadn't planned for. The other great challenge is knowing which video game is most suitable for each context.\"A method for finding the most suitable video game for the classroomWith this background in mind, the research carried out by Ferran Adell for his thesis led to the development of a method for identifying the educational potential of commercial video games. This method is based on five filters of characteristics that games must go through before they can be chosen for use in the classroom:Difficulty level. This is an exclusion criterion. Very complex video games or those with very sharp learning curves are very unlikely to be useful in the classroom.Flexible mechanics. This filter relates to the extent to which the game can be manipulated based on what the developer is offering. Some games, such as shooting games, provide very little flexibility. Others, on the other hand, are more flexible. An example of this latter type is City Skylines, a city construction game in which players can edit scenarios and set new goals. In this game, for example, your goal could be to build a completely sustainable and pollution-free city.Creative freedom. The more things you can develop in the video game, the greater its educational potential. \"This criterion can be applied in very different ways but, when you have full freedom to modify the environment, you can use the video game to work on many concepts,\" said Ferran Adell.Community power. In cases such as Minecraft, which has millions of people playing and creating tools, the customization options increase manyfold. In this UOC expert's opinion, the community also provides learning resources, such as YouTube tutorials or forums and wikis with detailed information about the game.Immersiveness. This criterion relates to the video game's ability to make players feel disconnected from the real world and involved in the character's story, the process of identification between a player and their character.\"Immersiveness is related to psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's flow theory, which talks about the ideal state of focus, attention and disconnectedness from one's surroundings, an increasingly elusive goal in the classroom,\" said Ferran Adell. \"You need an attractive environment with challenges that are somewhere between too easy\u2014and therefore potentially boring\u2014and too complex\u2014which can lead to frustration. This helps you work in a state of flow that is very interesting from an educational point of view.\"\"Playing is in our nature: it's inside us. Playing is key on a social level, and it's part of our culture,\" he concluded. \"By using play, you can make education fun, a concept that is not new and has been more than proven to work. It also has the advantage of fixing some of the problems facing education today: students' perception that what they're learning is pointless, and a lack of both interest and attention.\" Provided byUniversitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC)Citation:Video games and education: Five steps for choosing the perfect classroom game (2023, May 22)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-video-games-classroom-game.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "A deeper level and different kind of coordination, collaboration, and cooperation are needed to narrow the gap in employment opportunities between youth and young adults with and without disabilities. A collection of research articles in the latest special issue of the Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation presents strategies to improve the transition from school to work for young people with disabilities.          The special issue, guest edited by US-based vocational rehabilitation experts Johnny W. Collett, Phillip D. Rumrill, Jr., Connie Sung, and Jian Li, acknowledges the progress that has been made in the last nearly 50 years, partially thanks to legislation in the US that facilitates increased educational and employment inclusion for people with disabilities. However, research shows that outcomes for young people with disabilities still lag far behind those for non-disabled youth.The purpose of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is, in part, \"to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education, employment, and independent living.\"The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, is \"designed to strengthen and improve our nation's public workforce system and help Americans with barriers to employment, including individuals with disabilities, into high quality careers and help employers hire and retain skilled workers.\"\"In theory, these laws, working together, should result in improved educational and employment outcomes for people with disabilities. The problem is that laws don't work together\u2014people do. We need to think, plan, and work differently,\" according to Co-Guest Editor Johnny W. Collett, MAEd, University of Kentucky Human Development Institute, Lexington, KY, U.S., and former Assistant United States Education Secretary for the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services.\"We need to reject contentment with the status quo and abandon our complacency. We need to pursue improvement, innovation, and change relentlessly. We need to demonstrate that we care more about preparing people than we do about preserving systems,\" adds Co-Guest Editor Jian Li, Ph.D., Kent State University, Kent, OH, U.S..The most significant challenges to overcome for young people with disabilities are lack of on-the-job supports; negative employer and co-worker attitudes including discrimination, transportation, and technology issues; lack of provision of long-term supports for those with the most significant disabilities; and low expectations for young people with disabilities on the part of society at large.      \"There are no shortcuts to improved educational and employment outcomes for people with disabilities or to the systemic improvements that are needed at every level to facilitate them,\" comments Co-Guest Editor Connie Sung, Ph.D., Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, U.S..\"Individuals and teams seeking to advance ideas for improvement and innovation will likely encounter systems that are, by their nature, built to resist change. All of this is particularly true within government settings and other bureaucratic systems. However, while real and sustainable change will almost certainly be harder and take longer, the investment of time and effort will ultimately produce more than any presumed shortcut ever could.\"With the documented importance of career exploration and establishment activities in mind, the purpose of this special issue of the Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation is to highlight current scholarship regarding transition and individual supports in education and employment for youth and young adults with disabilities.Each article in this issue, through the findings it presents and the implications it raises, helps to inform this important and ongoing conversation about how best to prepare young people with disabilities for the adult world.\"To improve societal inclusion of young people with disabilities and facilitate better education and employment opportunities, we recommend verification of evidence-based practices that focus on competitive, integrated employment, training and technical assistance to school personnel, employers, and rehabilitation professionals, and increased utilization of vocational rehabilitation services,\" recommends Co-Guest Editor Phillip D. Rumrill, Jr, Ph.D., CRC, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, U.S..This collection of research papers in the Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation highlights the following topics:Pre-Employment Transition Services in different US statesThe adolescent behavioral indexEmployer discriminationJob interviewing practicesThe Cognitive Skills Enhancement ProgramHelping young adults with specific learning disabilitiesAnalysis of differences in race and ethnicity in Individual Placement Support servicesBarriers to employment for young adult central nervous system tumor survivorsAutistic youth's self-reporting of job interview skills and job interview anxietyTransition and employment for youth with autism spectrum disorderIn the first of these articles, lead investigator Aliza Lambert, Ph.D., CRC, Department of Psychiatric Rehabilitation and Counseling Professions, School of Health Professions, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, U.S., and her co-authors present the findings of a study on the delivery of pre-employment transition services (Pre-ETS) to 14\u201316-year-old students with significant disabilities in Virginia and Kentucky by families/students, vocational rehabilitation (VR) counselors, and educators.Dr. Lambert explains: \"Across all stakeholder groups in our study, participants stressed the importance of early career awareness and employment preparation skills for students with significant disabilities as critical for transition planning. Even though the benefits of early exposure were apparent, most participants reported that students aged 14\u201316 with significant disabilities had limited to no participation in Pre-ETS activities.\"The results of the study contribute to a growing body of research on the implementation of Pre-ETS. The implementation of Pre-ETS, especially for younger students with disabilities, is important to better understand the unique needs of these students and how to effectively provide these services. Obtaining stakeholder perspectives from families/students, VR counselors, and educators provide important insights on the facilitators and challenges to providing Pre-ETS.\"The results of this research are timely as states and localities continue to create Pre-ETS opportunities for students with disabilities early on in their career awareness and employment preparation process,\" Dr. Lambert adds. \"We are so thankful to the families, VR counselors, and educators who took time to talk with us and be a part of this important study. I hope the study and the results show that this work is very important and that more work needs to be done that centralizes the lived experiences of individuals with significant disabilities.\"Co-author Elizabeth Evans Getzel stresses that the need for early career planning and employment preparation for students with significant disabilities remains a critical issue because understanding the perspectives of various stakeholders on the delivery of Pre-ETS to engage younger students in the vocational rehabilitation process can offer insights on how to better serve them.

  "question_squad": " What is the current difference between savings and lending rates?",
  "answer_squad": " 5.1 percentage points",
  "text": "A new study investigates the role of effective capital markets for climate protection and the energy transition. Banks collect savings and make them available as loans and the greater the difference between savings and loan interest rates, the more it costs to invest. This affects, for example, investments in fossil-free steel plants, power generation, or heating systems.          The analysis by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC) has now been published in the Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (JAERE).The study shows that the effect on climate protection is striking: the current difference between savings and lending rates, 5.1 percentage points on average globally, results in additional global heating of 0.2 degrees Celsius, when compared with a frictionless economy with zero interest spread. To calculate this in its model-based analysis, the research team assumes a climate policy according to the cost-benefit principle.This implies: the government would know the exact level of climate damage that increases over time, rendering CO2 emissions more expensive in accordance with the damage caused by them, and would thus achieve a cost-optimal time path for accelerated carbon pricing. Alternatively, if the policy is oriented on a fixed temperature target, the current interest spread means that a 27 percent higher carbon price would be needed than in a world without the credit cost premium.The study's key message for policymakers is summarized by its PIK lead author, Kai Lessmann, as follows: \"Governments need to take a close look at whether the higher interest rate for loans merely reflects the actual intermediation costs or whether it is also a result of too little banking competition, for which there is some evidence. If the market structure is indeed the reason for the spread, and cannot be modified in the medium term, then policymakers can effectively counteract it in the short term by subsidizing investment.\"In this context, the study shows that if the government decides to provide economy-wide investment support, this is better for the climate and the economy than if eco-projects alone are subsidized. \"The structural change toward fossil-free technologies then occurs automatically,\" Lessmann points out. \"These are generally more capital-intensive and thus benefit to a greater extent from reduced credit costs. Also, the carbon price, which increases over time, exerts its steering effect.\"For the study, the research team has developed a sophisticated computational model, and has fed it with empirical data. \"We identify eight different channels through which the credit cost premium ultimately affects climate gas emissions,\" explains Co-author Matthias Kalkuhl of MCC.\"To be sure, there are also restraining effects\u2014for example, high interest rates reduce the growth of economic output and thus also of energy consumption. But the climate-damaging impact predominates. For example, the credit cost premium increases the abatement costs per ton of CO2, so that when oriented to the cost-benefit calculation, less climate protection is then practiced as a result.\"The adverse impact of high borrowing costs on climate protection, which is now illustrated more sharply than before, is a major issue primarily in the Global South. In many countries, it is not uncommon for the annual costs of capital as a percentage of the investment sum to be in double digits. While many solar or wind power parks would be more profitable than gas or coal-fired power plants in the long term, they are not being built there, because the initial capital required per megawatt of installed capacity is greater.Governments often lack the money to react, so they rely on help from the rich north.

  "text": "Bribery is among the most recognizable forms of corruption, and new research is shedding light on personality traits that could deter this behavior. Guilt-prone people are less likely to accept bribes, particularly when the act would cause obvious harm to other people.          The research, published in Social Psychological and Personality Science, contributes to a growing body of literature on individual differences in corrupt behaviors.\"Our results have important implications for current world events, particularly in the realm of politics and governance where corruption and bribery are major concerns,\" says author Prof. Xiaolin Zhou, of East China Normal University. \"More specifically, our results highlight the importance of assessing candidates' guilt proneness in personnel selection, especially when electing a leader for a group.\"Researchers conducted two online experiments with 2,082 college students, combining economic games with personality measures. The first study demonstrated that being guilt-prone was negatively associated with accepting bribes, while the second revealed a connection between people's concerns for others and their willingness to take a bribe. The research also highlights the potential of utilizing computational modeling to study moral decision-making and the underlying psychological mechanisms that shape ethical behavior.Dr. Zhou notes that the study is correlational rather than causal, meaning that researchers cannot definitively conclude that making someone more guilt-prone will reduce their likelihood of engaging in corrupt behavior. He also notes that the research focuses on being guilt-prone as a single personality trait and does not account for other moral-related personality traits that could influence bribery.\"It would be intriguing to investigate alternative psychological mechanisms\u2014such as responsibility, obedience, or conformity\u2014beyond the concern for others' suffering, that may underlie the relationship between guilt proneness and bribery,\" Dr. Zhou explains.In the meantime, the researchers would like to see the insights from this study leveraged to deter corrupt behavior.\"We hope that our findings can inform policies and interventions aimed at preventing corruption and promoting ethical behaviors in various domains, such as business and government,\" says the first author Dr. Yang Hu.

  "text": "Scientists have found what they believe to be the earliest known evidence of wine drinking in the Americas, inside ceramic artifacts recovered from a small Caribbean island. Forty ceramic sherds were examined in the first study to have used molecular analysis techniques\u2014Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry\u2014to investigate 15th century pottery from the Puerto Rico region.          The research focused on artifacts from the island of Isla de Mona, situated between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. The findings, published in Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences, address questions around dietary changes and cultural exchanges in the Greater Antilles prior to and after European arrival.Olive jar reveals earliest evidence of wine in the areaThe study was led by Dr. Lisa Briggs, Visiting Researcher at the British Museum.The analysis included sherds from a Spanish olive jar that could be dated between 1490-1520 AD. The rounded style of the jar shows it to be this early and aligns it to the timing of when Columbus first noted the existence of the island in his diary in 1494.The olive jar, used then as a general container for all sorts of food and liquid goods, transporting them on Spanish ships, had evidence of wine residues inside.\"Whether consumed by Europeans or members of the Indigenous population, this is direct evidence for the importation and drinking of European wine to a tiny island in the Caribbean shortly after the arrival of Spanish colonialists,\" say the researchers.Fusion food experience over 500 years agoAs first generations of Spanish colonists brought European traditions of wine consumption to the area, despite their conquest over Indigenous people the local traditions for cooking on barbeques continued.The researchers believe that barbeque cooking was commonplace among the Taino community, Indigenous to this area in the Caribbean, and adopted by early colonists. With no large mammals on the Caribbean islands in this area, it's likely that the Indigenous population would have barbequed a large rodent-like animal called a hutier, as well as iguanas.Indigenous people in this area of the Caribbean cooked fish and meat with charcoal over a raised grill, and the origin of the word 'barbeque' is traced to 'Barbacoa'\u2014a word used by the Taino people. The researchers suggest that in some ways, two culinary traditions came together\u2014creating a fusion food and drink experience hundreds of years ago.Dr. Briggs continued, \"Two culinary worlds collided in the Caribbean over 500 years ago, driven by the early Spanish colonial impositions. We really didn't know much about the culinary heritage of this area and the influence of early colonialists on food traditions, so uncovering the discoveries have been really exciting.\"The strong culinary traditions of the Taino people in creating the barbeque held firm despite Spanish colonialism, and influenced food right round the world. This continues today, as we are all familiar with a barbeque. I'm really pleased that this research shines a light on the cultural heritage of this community.\"      Indigenous culinary traditions persisted despite colonizersOn excavating the area last year, scientists from the British Museum found many fish and meat bones around the site\u2014but crucially none were found inside cooking pots.In the Caribbean ceramics analyzed, there was no evidence they were used for dairy or meat products. While dairy products were long a staple of European cooking, this does not appear to be the case on Isla de Mona\u2014giving further evidence that Indigenous culinary traditions persisted in the face of colonialism and imported ceramic vessels.\"This offers an interesting insight into culinary exchange on the island,\" the researchers say. \"...it appears traditional foodways were maintained even after an influx of European colonists arrived on the island with their glazed ceramics and olive jars. The lack of evidence for dairy products in our samples further suggests that European colonialists quickly came to adopt and rely on Indigenous culinary traditions.\"This indicates that the Indigenous people continued to cook proteins on charcoal over a raised grill, and vegetable dishes in the ceramic pots. This culinary tradition is far apart from the contemporary European preference for stews and casseroles\u2014with cooking pots from that area often including meat remnants.The research paper, \"Molecular evidence for new foodways in the early colonial Caribbean: organic residue analysis at Isla de Mona, Puerto Rico,\" involved a team of researchers from Cranfield University, Leicester University, the University of East Anglia, the University of York and the British Museum.

  "question_squad": " What is the term for the idea that humans are fleshy automata?",
  "answer_squad": " techno-faber",
  "text": "The great\u2014if sometimes overlooked\u201420th-century philosopher and cultural critic G\u00fcnther Anders once proposed that our modern age is characterized by a dangerous and pervasive \"Apocalypse-Blindheit\": a blindness to the apocalypse.          Writing in the midst of the 20th-century nuclear arms race, he suggested an unquestioning faith in science and progress prevents us from seeing the technological catastrophe spreading out all around us.The reality of human-created climate change has, in recent years, perhaps begun to cure this condition. And there are at least some indications a significant number of people are becoming aware of the mess we're in.But as Richard King notes in his sweeping and ambitious Here Be Monsters, our philosophical or intellectual responses to technology have not really kept pace with events.Instead, what King calls \"the techno-critical tradition,\" or a tradition of thinkers who view technological modernity as fundamentally damaging and foreboding, has more or less disappeared.Thus, once-towering philosophers of technology\u2014figures like Lewis Mumford, who was already warning in the 1950s that unrestricted technological expansion threatened the durability of both the human and the natural worlds, and Neil Postman, who in the 1980s described modern society as a \"technopoly\" in which human behavior is thoroughly governed and regulated by machines\u2014hardly receive any attention at all.And the more \"techno-critical\" elements of those who are studied widely (notably the ubiquitous Hannah Arendt) are quickly glossed over or pushed to the margins.Why, then, have full-throated critiques of technology become so scarce at the exact moment when they might seem most pertinent? Where have all the Luddites gone?Recovering human natureKing argues one crucial reason for the decline of the techno-critical tradition is its tendency to rely on the concept of human nature.We can only maintain our technologies corrupt us if we have some relatively fixed sense of who we would be without them.But, particularly in the rarefied atmosphere of universities, the concept of human nature has been decidedly unfashionable (indeed all but forbidden) for nearly half a century. It has become commonplace to suggest every definition of the human, no matter how loose or how broad, exists primarily to exclude its opposite. We define the \"human,\" the argument goes, to mark off forms of life that can be labeled inhuman, and thus justify their elimination.As King sees it, the widespread abandonment of the concept of human nature might be well-intentioned. But it has inadvertently left us vulnerable to an unthinking veneration of technology\u2014one particularly amendable to the interests of capitalism.For to strip the human of all natural limits is to present it as nothing more than what King calls a \"blank slate\"\u2014a programmable machine capable of being engineered for optimal production and consumption, void of any essential needs or desires.\"The danger,\" King writes, \"is not that we create a monster that runs amok, or a plague of zombies, or a rogue AI\u2014or a planet of the apes, for that matter\u2014but that we begin to see ourselves and others as something less than fully human, as machines to be rewired or recalibrated in line with the dominant ideological worldview. \"In that case, we would already have arrived at a perilous situation\u2014a situation where our perception of ourselves as bounded by and connected through nature had given way to the \"post-humanist\" view that humans are fleshy automata, subject to endless modification.For King, this danger is at a historical tipping point. And we must face it immediately. Doing so, however, will require more than an examination of technology itself.It will require what King dubs a \"radical humanism,\" and a fundamental reassessment of what we are\u2014including our relations with ourselves, with one another, and with our common world.      Homo faber, or the tool-making animalHere Be Monsters proposes to develop nothing less than a new definition of human nature.King, of course, is fully aware of the immensity of the task, and he is careful to qualify his approach in important ways. He acknowledges, for example, the basic difficulty of distinguishing between nature and culture. Any consistent understanding of the former would eventually have to envelop the latter.It's part of human nature to produce culture, King allows. The human is \"Homo faber\", he proposes, \"man the maker.\" And \"no less than the instinct for self-preservation or sexual desire, technological creativity is fundamental to our being.\"But from King's perspective, there is a qualitative difference between building tools that harness the power of nature (for example, a windmill) and using technology to alter its very fabric (for example, splitting the atom).The line might be hard to pinpoint. But as King sees it, in the age of nuclear energy, genetic engineering, nanotechnology, machine learning, and much more, it was crossed long ago.King similarly acknowledges his tendency to frame the problem in ways that primarily concern the wealthy inhabitants of the Global North\u2014and that the same issues will look entirely different from the perspective of the Global South. It must be infuriating to hear those who have already reaped most of the benefits of technological development now insist that limits be placed on those who have paid most of the costs.\"Nevertheless,\" King insists, \"the Global North and Global South [\u2026] are at very different stages of development.\" And precisely because it has advanced further into the belly of the beast, \"the North has problems the South doesn't have, or has to a lesser degree.\" The North, in other words, should not be seen as a model, but as a warning.Social, embodied, creativeFollowing these introductory remarks, King divides his book into three parts. Each addresses a crucial aspect of the human experience, and the way modern technology threatens to destroy it.The first part describes humans as essentially social creatures, who require both the physical presence of other humans and a robust political community in order to become themselves.It argues that social media, algorithmic manipulation, and what King calls \"technologies of absence\" corrupt this aspect of our existence.The second part takes up the related question of our embodiment. King proposes neither the mind nor the body can be reduced to mechanistic calculations, and warns against the pernicious effects of attempting to do so.For King, when we view our mind as nothing more than a large calculator and our body as an object to be constructed and reconstructed at will, we risk losing sight of the very limits that make it possible for us to flourish.Finally, the third part explores the human capacity for free creation and \"the pleasures of practical activity.\" Here King seeks to revitalize the familiar Marxist theme of alienation, or the sense in which technological modes of production distance us from the products of our labor. And he begins to sketch out the parameters of what he calls \"a new relationship with technology.\"As King sees it, we stand on the verge of a precipice. The technologies we have constructed to make our way in the world are very close to depriving us of any world whatsoever.\"In order to avoid this trap,\" King concludes, \"we will need to develop a radical humanism that puts the social and creative needs of human beings front and center\"\u2014one that, once again, \"is not afraid [\u2026] to invoke the concept of human nature.\"Historicizing the humanHere Be Monsters deals extensively with specific technologies, offering a kind of pessimistic catalog of their worst potential. But some of its most intriguing arguments concern philosophical and ideological positions that were established long before the advent of either the atomic or the digital age.King spends a considerable amount of time dismantling the platitudes of utilitarianism, liberalism, and capitalism.And he shows how these phenomena, which have their roots in the 17th and 18th centuries, provided the intellectual and material foundations of what we now call \"neoliberalism.\" This is a way of thinking that King takes to be fundamentally at odds with human well-being, and with the project of humanity as such.The problem is, we cannot really historicize one concept of the human\u2014namely the neoliberal concept, which treats humans as self-interested, profit-maximizing machines\u2014without historicizing the concept of \"humanity\" as a whole.That is to say, while the biological species \"human being\" has obviously existed for a very long time, the notion that all members of that species share a common world, that we all have some common interests, and even that we all possess common rights, is not that old at all.In this sense, it might be best to think of our humanity, not as an object we might investigate and describe, like a part of the natural world, but more like a response to a crisis or an event.As we arguably witnessed for fleeting moments during the COVID pandemic, humanity is called into existence\u2014and we belong to it\u2014when something larger than life grips us all, and we are compelled to act in concert.The question is whether we will ever be able to do this in the sustained manner required to address the overwhelming existential catastrophes outlined by King.

  "text": "Not long ago, a team of researchers made a startling discovery about attitudes toward women in Saudi Arabia. Most young married men in the country were privately in favor of women working outside of the home but mistakenly believed that a majority of their peers were not.          After being told that most married men in their age range actually support women's employment, they became more willing to help their own wives look for work\u2014and women were more likely to take on higher-paying jobs.Those findings, published in the American Economic Review in 2020, raised an intriguing question: Was the disconnect between how views toward women were perceived, versus what they actually were, limited to Saudi Arabia? Or is it pervasive worldwide?Turns out, Saudi Arabia is the rule\u2014not the exception\u2014when it comes to what people think others' attitudes about gender policies are and what those attitudes truly are, according to a new global study by Stanford economist Alessandra Voena and a team of researchers that included authors from the Saudi Arabia experiment.\"Misperceptions of gender norms are ubiquitous across the globe,\" says Voena, an economics professor in the School of Humanities and Sciences and a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR).In the new paper, released by the National Bureau of Economic Policy Research, Voena and her co-authors analyze gender views in 60 countries representing 85% of the world's population. They find that people worldwide often misjudge what others think about certain policies supporting women and what the majority opinion actually is.Men and women, for example, are often believed to be on opposite sides of gender issues, such as whether women should have an advantage in hiring for leadership positions in government and business. The study data suggest that such perceptions are wrong: Men and women are much more aligned than people think.And though the study's overall results show that, across the world, both genders support issues around women's rights to a much higher degree than conventional wisdom holds, the evidence suggests, too, that women tend to be less supportive, and men, more supportive than most people think.The patterns uncovered in the study are so pervasive, Voena and her co-authors write, that they suggest that policies aimed at closing the gender gap\u2014or the absences of such policies\u2014may not reflect what people actually want.The findings, Voena says, have important implications for efforts to design policies that narrow the gender gap.\"We are not saying that we have to get rid of these misperceptions,\" she says. \"But if a goal of policymakers is to promote gender equality, it's useful to know as an initial step that we as a society are more progressive than people think and that maybe we should be acting according to those more progressive views.\"What you think, what others thinkHow is it that people are getting public opinion so wrong? Research since at least the early 1930s has consistently shown that people often misread societal attitudes\u2014and that those miscalculations shape their behavior. In the context of gender issues, Voena and her co-authors suggest that misperceptions exist for a number of reasons. These include outdated gender stereotypes as well as the tendency for minority views to get outsized attention in the media and elsewhere.\"It also takes a while for people to learn that views change,\" says Voena, pointing to human psychology as another reason.

  "answer_squad": " significant differences in intergenerational educational mobility",
  "text": "A small team of economists from Harvard University, Sihlquai 10, Adliswil, Brown University, and the London Business School has found differences in education level attainment across Africa based at least in part on religion. In their paper published the journal Nature, the group describes how they used data collected via censuses in multiple countries in Africa to learn more about whether education levels in Africa are impacted by religious affiliation.          In all the team looked at census data for 21 African countries, noting that religion plays a very important role in not just daily life, but also in education, across the continent. They also note that Africa is home to some of the largest Muslim and Christian communities and that participation rates in religious activities are high.To learn more about the impact of religion on education, the team compared average levels of educational attainment with religion type. In so doing, they found what they describe as significant differences in intergenerational educational mobility across these two main groups of people. The researchers define intergenerational educational mobility as a measure of offspring going farther in their educational attainment than their parents.The research group found that Christians tended to have higher upward mobility and lower downward mobility than did Muslims and traditionalists. They suggest this indicates that Christian children are more likely to complete primary school if their parents did not, and are less likely to drop out of primary school if their parents did finish.It also suggests that Muslim and traditionalist children are more likely to drop out of primary school even if their parents did not drop out, and that they are also less likely to complete such education if their parents did not.In looking at other factors the research team was not able to find any other that might account for such differences in educational attainment. But they do note that history has likely played a role in the differences they have seen. Colonialism, which often began with the introduction of Christian missionaries, they point out, tended to stress education. Meanwhile, colonial authorities tended to restrict education when encountering people who were established Muslims.The researchers conclude by suggesting that their findings indicate that officials looking to improve educational attainment in Africa may need to take a closer look at the impact that religion plays in participation in programs geared toward raising education levels and make adjustments accordingly.

  "answer_squad": " prolonged immobility",
  "text": "The law should take into consideration neuroscientific evidence that suggests fear and threat can cause victims to become \"frozen\" in cases of rape or sexual assault, argue UCL experts.          In a comment article, published in Nature Human Behaviour, Professor Patrick Haggard and former UCL undergraduate, Ebani Dhawan, state that victims of sexual assault are often blamed for not fighting or fleeing their attackers.Thirty percent of women are thought to experience sexual assault or rape in their lifetime. And, of those who have attended an emergency clinic, 70% reported being \"frozen\" during the ordeal, and unable to move or cry out.The researchers highlight court cases such as R v Lennox (2018), a case in Australia, in which the defense lawyer questions the victim as to why she froze and did not show signs of struggle, transferring the blame of the sexual assault to her.However, the researchers argue that the victim's immobility may be entirely involuntary\u2014in which case blame is inappropriate. For example, research has shown that when presented with threats, the brain's response can include blocking the neural circuits that provide voluntary control over body movement.Many animals freeze briefly in response to mild threat, so they are poised to trigger a fight or flight reaction. But in response to immediate and severe threat, the behavior may change to a prolonged immobility where the body becomes either completely frozen or limp. Similar processes occur in humans, and questionnaire studies have shown that sexual assault victims often report being unable to move or cry out during the assault, even when they are not physically constrained.Arguments for the defense in rape and sexual assault cases sometimes misinterpret the absence of struggle as an indication of consent. But if the victim is involuntarily immobile, this argument is incorrect.Corresponding author, Professor Haggard (UCL Psychology & Language Sciences), said, \"The law has long recognized 'loss of control' defenses and can accord diminished responsibility in specific situations, in which evidence shows that actions were made outside of voluntary control. This can include some medical conditions, such as sleep disorders, alongside extreme situations such as coercive control and emotional triggering.\"\"After reviewing neuroscientific evidence, we suggest that the same consideration should be made towards involuntary immobility during rape and sexual assault.\"\"We hope that this could help prevent inappropriate victim blaming and potentially draw wider societal attention to the crucial importance of active consent.\"Rape and sexual assault can have devastating impacts for both individuals and society.In 2021-2022 the police in England and Wales recorded over 70,000 rapes. However, only 3% led to a charge.Ebani Dhawan said, \"Legal definitions of rape and sexual assault are based on the absence of consent. However, it is not unusual for victims' reports of non-consent to be questioned in court\u2014against un-evidenced stereotypes of how a 'real' victim would allegedly behave.\"For example, perpetrators may claim that they assumed the victim was consenting due to absence of any clear attempt to resist.\"\"We should use neuroscientific findings to prevent these myths being peddled as a defense argument for sexual violence, and to ensure justice for victims.\"Rape and sexual assault are criminal behaviors that cannot be studied directly. Animal studies can only offer a limited insight into how immobility in response to threat might affect human voluntary action control. The researchers hope their conclusions may drive future research on this neglected but important topic.

  "answer_squad": " Valdocarros II",
  "text": "Human history is intimately entwined with the use and control of fire. However, working out when our relationship with fire began and how it subsequently evolved has been notoriously difficult.          This is partly due to the incomplete nature of archaeological records, and also because fire use was fleeting, making burnt remains difficult to detect.But our team has found evidence of the controlled use of fire by direct human ancestors\u2014or hominins\u2014at a site in Spain dating to 250,000 years ago. This pushes the earliest evidence of fire control in Europe back by 50,000 years. The findings have been published in Nature Scientific Reports. It is truly special to find the remains of human ancestors and fire at the same location.There is much earlier evidence of hominins exploiting fire, but this could have taken the form of hominins taking advantage of the burning embers from a natural wildfire to cook their food. The controlled use of fire is where humans intentionally start it and then manage, say, its extent or temperature. This is what we have evidence for at the site in Spain.Much older evidence from outside Europe, which could be from humans making use of natural blazes, comes from Swartkrans cave in South Africa, where hominin remains were found with hundreds of burnt animal bones dating to between 1 and 1.5 million years ago. Burnt animal bone fragments were also identified at the 1.5 million-year-old site known as FxJj 20AB at Koobi Fora, Kenya.Yet finding hominin artefacts and burnt bones at the same site does not in itself indicate that they coincided in time, let alone that humans were controlling fire. The path to its controlled use, is likely to have been gradual.Intentional use?Fast forward almost a million years to the earliest-known clear evidence of fire made by humans: an open-air site called Gesher Benot Ya'aqov in Israel, dated to about 790,000 years ago. The evidence found at this location includes charred plants and burnt stone tools lying alongside one another.Other sites in Israel, such as Quesem Cave, with finds dating to between 420,000 and 200,000 years ago and Tabun Cave, where the archaeological discoveries are around 340,000 years old, feature similar fire evidence.While early evidence such as this is suggestive of fire control, a direct link between resources such as wood fuel, activities, such as the preparation of fire, and intention \u2013- arguably a prerequisite for controlled fire \u2013- can be difficult to establish. In Europe, it is generally accepted that fire was routinely exploited by hominins at least 350,000 years ago, with some suggestion of fire control being linked to the expansion of a particular stone tool technology known as the Acheulean.Indeed, there is a concurrent rise in apparent prehistoric \"fireplaces\", or hearths, and burnt Acheulean artefacts, such as hand-axes made from flint and a sedimentary rock called chert, at lots of European sites dated between 450,000 and 250,000. Many of these also contain charred plant materials and bones.                The spread of a stone tool technology called the Acheulean may be linked to the exploitation of fire in Europe. Credit: WH_Pics / Shutterstock Yet there is some reason to believe that these associations are of natural origin\u2014for example, from wildfires or lightning strikes. Before the new evidence, the oldest clear evidence of fire control in Europe came from Menez-Dregan in France and Bolomor Cave in Spain, which are both dated to about 200,000 years ago. Another early site with clear evidence of domestic fire use is Abrigo de la Quebrada in Spain, dated to around 100,000 years ago.      New benchmarkThe new evidence from the Valdocarros II site in Spain, dated to about 250,000 years ago, serves as a new benchmark for understanding our ancient relationship with fire.Lipid biomarkers are the remains of molecules that have come from specific sources, such as particular types of wood, and have been left by processes such as fire. Recently published data on lipid biomarkers from various archaeological sites reveals details of the unique resources\u2014for example, the types of wood\u2014used to create isolated campfires associated with Acheulean artefacts.Lipid biomarker evidence from Valdocarros shows diagnostic signatures indicating that decaying pine was used as fuel. Intriguingly, records of pollen and of the relationship between water and climate from the surrounding region suggest that decaying pine would have been an uncommon resource.Corroborative evidence comes in the form of molecules called polyaromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, which are products of incomplete combustion. Analysis of these reveals that decaying pine at Valdocarros II was burned at low temperatures of around 350\u2103 for relatively short periods.Fires that are too hot tend to char and burn foods on the outside before the inside of the item has reached a useful temperature. Lower temperatures are needed to break down biological tissue, so that it's easier to digest\u2014one of the key reasons for cooking food. Conversely, it's unlikely that low-temperature fires would have been used purely for warmth, given much more commonplace wood burns at hotter temperatures. Another perk of using decaying pine is that it's easy to ignite.Choice of fuelThus the fires at Valdocarros II look to have been used for activities such as cooking. The intriguing record of fire use at this Spanish site begins to emerge upon combining all of the available evidence. For instance, there is a rich fossil record of mammals at Valdocarros II that includes abundant butchered red deer (Cervus elaphus) and the wild ancestors of domestic cattle, known as aurochs (Bos primigenius). The aurochs could each have weighed up to 1,500kg or more.Therefore, hominins at this site show all the necessary prerequisites for controlling fire: the use of specific resources such as decaying pine wood; specific activities, such as the low-temperature fires used for cooking; and intention, which can be implied by the need to transport large carcasses to a single location where fire was being used.By any standard, hominins at Valdocarros II were controlling fire. The site is not the oldest, nor the first instance of controlled fire. Rather, it is a significant benchmark in the course of human evolution because it sets a clear time limit on the emergence of a defining human characteristic.The work at Valdocarros II also creates the opportunity for a wider discussion about how to establish intention and foresight from archaeological evidence, as well as from the wider breadth of human evolution and prehistory.

  "text": "Blockchain technology, investor sentiment, and economic stress levels are significant predictors of bitcoin returns, according to a groundbreaking paper from Illinois Institute of Technology researchers that provides empirical evidence to help guide investors, economists, and academics.          Sang Baum \"Solomon\" Kang, associate professor of finance at Illinois Tech's Stuart School of Business and co-author of the paper, also found that the cryptocurrency is detached from economic fundamentals and therefore may not effectively serve as a diversifier or safe-haven asset. Additionally, Kang reported that returns on commodities, securities, and other assets do not predict bitcoin returns well.The paper, titled \"What Information Variables Predict Bitcoin Returns? A Dimension-Reduction Approach,\" was published in The Journal of Alternative Investments. Kang co-wrote the paper with two of his former doctoral students: Yao Xie (M.S. Finance '15, Ph.D. MSC '21), an associate quantitative analyst at Morningstar Inc., and Jialin Zhao (Stuart Ph.D. MSC '17), associate professor of quantitative management at St. Mary's University in San Antonio.The team used predictive analytics techniques and dimension-reduction models on data from January 2011 to January 2020, analyzing 25 information variables under the categories macroeconomics, blockchain technology, other assets, stress level, and investor sentiment.\"We find that blockchain technology, investor sentiment, and stress level have predictive power for bitcoin returns,\" says Kang. \"Similar to traditional assets, bitcoin shows higher return predictability with longer return horizons. These findings support the dual nature of bitcoin as a technical artifact and speculative asset.\"Key findings include:Increased difficulty in mining Bitcoin positively predicts returns. This supports the theory that as blockchain technology requirements increase, bitcoin's supply is reduced, thus increasing its return.Bitcoin returns are positively driven by investor sentiment, indicating the speculative nature of the cryptocurrency as an asset.Higher stress levels or financial turmoil in the economy cause a decrease in future bitcoin returns, underscoring the risks associated with holding bitcoin as an asset.According to the researchers, bitcoin has functioned in three different economic roles over time: as a form of currency, as a speculative security, and as a safe-haven commodity due to its scarcity and mining costs.\"In academia, there is a research methodology called the asset return predictability study,\" says Kang. \"An underlying principle is that variables predicting the future movement of an asset price may be important in the economic system. So understanding what those variables are is important not only to traders who want to take a position in bitcoin, but also to economists who want to understand the nature of bitcoin.\" More information:Sang Baum Kang et al, What Information Variables Predict Bitcoin Returns?

  "text": "As Swedish cities are densified at a fast pace, there is now construction very close to roads and thoroughfares\u2014land that was considered unthinkable for development just a decade ago.          It is already known that noise can have a negative impact on human health, but new research from Chalmers University of Technology shows that as little as 40 decibels of traffic noise\u2014the typical level of background noise in an office environment or kitchen\u2014has a detrimental effect on cognitive performance.Researchers at the Chalmers Division of Applied Acoustics have conducted a laboratory study in which test subjects took concentration tests while being exposed to background traffic noise. The subjects were asked to look at a computer screen and react to certain letters, then to assess their perceived workload afterwards.The study shows that the subjects had significantly poorer results on the performance test, and also felt that the task was more difficult to carry out, with traffic noise in the background.\"What is unique about our study is that we were able to demonstrate a decline in performance at noise levels as low as 40 dB, which corresponds to the regular noise level in an office environment or a kitchen,\" says Leon M\u00fcller, doctoral student at the Division of Applied Acoustics in the Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering.The background noise consisted of two audio sequences simulating trucks passing by at a distance of ten and fifty meters. Both sequences were normalized to the same total indoor level of 40 dB.\"The audio sequence simulating the closer passages, where the sound changes significantly as the vehicle passes by, was usually the one that bothered the test subjects the most,\" M\u00fcller says. \"This could be because traffic that is further away is perceived as a more constant drone.\"Housing is built closer to roads nowThe new results emphasize an already problematic situation of negative impact on health and job performance due to traffic noise. In recent years, the distance between roads and newly built housing in Swedish cities has been allowed to shrink\u2014a trend that can also be seen internationally.Put somewhat simplistically, the Swedish regulations for where construction is permitted are based on the average outdoor noise level over a 24-hour period\u2014meaning that they do not take individual pass-bys into account. In addition, current regulations do not cover the peaks of low-frequency noise indoors, which is difficult to avoid and is, according to research, more disruptive and therefore more impacting on human health.In one study modeling low-frequency noise, Jens Forss\u00e9n, Professor of applied acoustics at Chalmers, showed that such noise is primarily generated by heavy traffic at low speeds, and is difficult to shut out even with well-insulated windows and buildings that comply with all the construction norms and guidelines for sound insulation.      Reduced vehicle speed can increase the noise exposure indoors\"The calculations for different types of facades show that it is difficult to achieve ideal indoor sound environments near heavily trafficked roads,\" Forss\u00e9n says. \"Reducing speeds is not a solution, as our calculations show that the indoor noise exposure can even increase at lower speeds.\"Further, Forss\u00e9n says that noise and the sound environment are a factor that is often considered too late in the planning process, and that there are advantages that could be achieved if adjustments were made in order to better utilize the space in terms of noise pollution.The researchers also agree that the most effective solution would be to avoid urban densification in areas where traffic noise would have too great an impact on health and well-being.More about the researchThe laboratory environment at Chalmers where the research was conducted looks like a living room with furniture and textiles, but behind the ceiling panels and windows is an advanced speaker system that allows the researchers to simulate various sounds, such as road traffic noise.In the tests, the 42 participants were asked to conduct a continuous performance test (CPT) during each sound sequence. They watched a computer monitor where individual letters were displayed in sequences and were instructed to press a button for all letters except X.Additionally, the subjects filled in a form called the NASA task load index (NASA TLX), a tool for measuring a person's subjective assessment of their workload when completing a task. The subjects rated their perceived workload based on six dimensions: perceived mental workload, physical workload, time pressure, effort, performance and degree of frustration.The findings are published in the journalsBuilding Acoustics and International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.

  "question_squad": " What percentage of smart-workers used one less day of leave per month?",
  "answer_squad": " 40%",
  "text": "During the coronavirus lockdowns, 50% of European workers were estimated to engage in some form of smart working\u2014smart working at its worst, though, because it was unplanned and in many cases full-time, with a strong potential to create a sense of social isolation. The flip side of the coin is that this experience revealed that smart working is feasible both for routine and for non-routine tasks, and agreements that allow employees to work from home one or more days per week are now common in the Western world. What is still lacking is a scientifically rigorous assessment of its effectiveness.          In a study published in Management Science, using a randomized controlled trial (the gold standard of scientific research), Paola Profeta and Marta Angelici (Bocconi Department of Social and Political Sciences) concluded that the flexibility of smart-working improves the well-being and work-life balance of workers, without reducing their productivity.\"An interesting side-effect is that men, when they can work from home, increase the time devoted to household chores. The gender balance does not shift much, since women still work longer hours at those chores, but women report balancing their work and personal lives better,\" said Professor Profeta, a scholar specializing in gender economics and Director of the AXA Research Lab on Gender Equality at Bocconi University.The study was conducted immediately before the COVID-19 lockdowns, i.e., in conditions reasonably comparable to the present day.The authors divided 310 white-collar and blue-collar employees of an Italian multi-utility in two groups: 65% of them were granted smart-working one day a week (the standard use in pre-COVID times) for nine months, while 35% went on working as usual. Productivity, well-being and work-life balance of the two groups were monitored throughout the experiment using data provided by the company and questionnaires completed by the workers of both groups and their supervisors.The productivity of smart-workers, measured by various indicators, slightly grew, but the difference became statistically significant only from month 7 (out of 9) on.Smart-workers used one less day of leave per month compared to workers who had not been granted flexibility. It means that 1 of the 4 smart-working days per month likely would have otherwise been absence (e.g., because of a sick child, dentist appointment, or doctor's checkup).Compliance with deadlines was 40% higher for smart-workers.Smart-workers were 33% more satisfied with their life in general and 40% more satisfied with their free time.Smart-workers recorded better capacity to stay focused, less loss of sleep due to concerns, and less feelings of stress.Smart-workers reported that having some freedom to set their start and finish times and arrange breaks during the working day is associated with more time dedicated to household and care activities, both for men and women.\"Removing constraints on the place and time of work appears to be a promising and more efficient organization of working,\" the authors concluded, \"without detectable negative effects on gender gaps. Smart-working also appears to be a promising way to promote work-life balance, which is becoming a significant issue in modern societies. This result was not obvious to foresee, since previous analyses have warned about the risk of overworking related to flexible work arrangements, with all the possible negative consequences involving stress, well-being, health, etc.\" More information:Marta Angelici et al, Smart Working: Work Flexibility Without Constraints, Management Science (2023).

These two worlds (A-side and B-side) are supposed to differ in terms of the six-dimensional spaces (A and B) hidden in each world.       However, as these spaces are extremely similar and invisible, theoretically, we cannot distinguish them from the world that we live in. Considerable research has been conducted on the properties of space A, and extreme changes (i.e., blowing up) do not occur in it under certain conditions.However, recently it has been discovered that spaces A and B are transformed in certain ways and their apparently different objects correspond to each other. However, the nature and extent of this transformation are not well understood, and research on the properties of space B has not yet progressed.In this new study, published in the Asian Journal of Mathematics, researchers mathematically investigated whether the behavior of space B also has the same properties as that of space A. They transferred a known phenomenon from the A-side to the B-side and proved that blowing up does not occur even in space B under certain conditions.This achievement provides mathematical proof for one of the previously intuitively expected similarities between the A-side and B-side.

  "text": "An archaeologist and a biologist have found evidence of birds being sacrificed to the goddess Isis in the excavated ruins of the Temple of Isis in Pompeii. In their study, reported in the International Journal of Osteoarchaeology, Chiara Assunta Corbino and Beatrice Demarchi studied frescos found at the ancient site revealing the role birds played in ritual banquets.          The goddess Isis was first worshiped by people in ancient Egypt. Myths from the time suggest she resurrected her husband and slain brother and thus came to be known as a goddess who helped the dead enter the afterlife. Worship of Isis spread to ancient Greece, where the name meant \"great mother,\" and eventually to Italy and the rest of the Roman Empire.During this latter time, belief in Isis became a cult-like obsession in which she was worshiped as part of ritual celebrations. Corbino and Demarchi suggest that such rituals were likely performed by priests. They believe they have found evidence of such rituals in frescos on the walls of the Temple of Isis in Pompeii.Prior research has found that the Temple of Isis was mostly destroyed during an earthquake sometime around A.D. 62. Imagery in the frescos suggest they were added after the earthquake as part of renovations. The researchers found depictions of rituals involving birds. Thus far, they have found evidence of geese, turtle doves, chickens and ibises, along with pigs and various sea creatures. This new finding, the researchers suggest, adds more evidence to theories that birds were used in Isis worship rituals in other places.The researchers note that the find is significant because such rituals were conducted in private; thus, little evidence of them have been found. The Isis frescos are the first to have been found in Italy. The researchers also note that the birds were charred, suggesting that the people conducting the rituals had eaten them\u2014likely as part of a banquet similar to some of those shown in the frescos.

  "text": "The teaching profession is already struggling with shortages and a lack of new candidates in a situation widely regarded as a crisis. Now, research warns that teachers are being priced out of housing near their schools, with many areas even too expensive for educators at the top of the pay scale.          The study, published recently in The Australian Educational Researcher analyzed quarterly house sales and rental reports in New South Wales (NSW) and found more than 90% of teaching positions across the state\u2014around 50,000 full-time roles\u2014are located in Local Government Areas (LGAs) where housing is unaffordable on a teacher's salary.The situation is particularly dire for new teachers. There are 675 schools\u2014nearly 23,000 full-time teaching positions\u2014where the median rent for a one-bedroom place is unaffordable on a graduate teacher's salary.Housing is considered unaffordable if a person spends more than 30% of their income on housing costs\u2014sometimes called being in housing stress. Those in housing stress may not have enough money remaining to cover the cost of food, clothing, and other essentials.But affordability isn't just an issue for early career teachers. For experienced educators at the top of the pay scale, 70 schools\u2014about 2,000 full-time roles\u2014are in an LGA where a single-bedroom dwelling is also unaffordable.\"The study shows the last time a first-year teacher salary could comfortably afford the rent for a one-bedroom dwelling was around a decade ago,\" says Professor Scott Eacott, the author of the study and Deputy Director of the Gonski Institute for Education at UNSW Arts, Design & Architecture.\"Fundamentally, there's been an increasing gap between salary and the costs of housing that the standard pay rise isn't covering, and it's pushing teachers further away from their workplaces or out of the profession entirely.\"The issue is not just limited to teachers, but all essential workers who are increasingly finding it difficult to find affordable places to live within a reasonable distance of their workplace.\"Home ownership is also out of reach for teachers on a single income, with median prices in some areas more than ten times the average teacher salary. Sydney is particularly cost-prohibitive, with the most unaffordable LGAs for teachers being Bayside, Canada Bay, Sydney, and Waverley.\"We'll find it hard to attract new teachers when even a modest one-bedroom apartment is unaffordable,\" Prof. Eacott says. \"But also, we'll lose many experienced teachers simply because they can't afford to live close to where they work.\"      A profession in crisisProf. Eacott says housing affordability has been somewhat overlooked in the teacher shortage crisis because of other important issues like increasing workloads, poor working conditions, and stagnant pay.\"The teacher shortage is complex, and there are many factors why we lose teachers, especially in the first five years,\" Prof. Eacott says. \"But housing affordability is one of those understated reasons why, and not doing anything to address it will only amplify the problem.\"Prof. Eacott says the extraordinary price of housing means teachers have to choose between spending a significant amount of their salary to live in reasonable proximity to their school or endure a long and grinding daily commute.\"Commutes of more than an hour would not be uncommon, which is a lot of productive time lost for teachers, not to mention all the hidden costs of tolls and parking. We're going to look at it more in future research,\" Prof. Eacott says.Some projections indicate that NSW will need 13,000 more teachers in the next decade to meet student demand. While much of the projected growth is in areas not historically considered hard-to-staff, Prof. Eacott says that is likely to change if teachers aren't able to live locally.\"The school system is struggling to find enough teachers as it is,\" Prof. Eacott says. \"If teachers can't afford to live near or within reasonable commuting distance of their schools, we can only expect those shortfalls to continue to grow.\"Creating housing pathways for teachers Prof. Eacott says part of the challenge is that no single government department or the private sector is ultimately responsible for housing essential workers. While more investment from superannuation funds in essential worker housing developments is welcome, it won't be enough to address the issue at scale.\"The simple answer is we do need to be paying teachers more. But that may not necessarily solve supply problems,\" Prof. Eacott says. \"For example, it is just incredibly difficult right now for teachers to find a place to rent given record low vacancy rates.\"It's also important that we're not confining teachers to just teacher apartments, but creating pathways to home ownership.\"Prof. Eacott says salary loading for teachers working in severely unaffordable LGAs would be one potential policy solution that could be implemented in the short term to help alleviate the cost of housing.\"An allowance for those teaching in LGAs where housing is out of reach would be a targeted and tailored first intervention,\" Prof. Eacott says. \"The issue is, it may end up being the entire eastern seaboard, which, at that point, is just a salary rise.\"Long-term, Prof. Eacott says teachers and other essential workers should be considered more in infrastructure planning when developing future cities.\"We rely so much on our teachers, so it's only fair we take steps towards providing them and other essential workers with affordable and secure housing options,\" Prof. Eacott says.

  "text": "Changes to how schools are assessed and improved professional learning are critical to the success of education reforms in Wales, a study concludes.          Researchers at Cardiff University interviewed policymakers and those who hold a strategic role in designing and implementing the Health and Well-being aspects of the Curriculum for Wales, which was rolled out in schools from September, as part of a series of projects to measure its long-term success.Published in the British Educational Research Journal, the findings suggest the reforms to the education system require changes at multiple levels to achieve the bold aspirations and goals of the Curriculum for Wales.Dr. Sara Long, a research fellow at the Center for the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions for Public Health Improvement (DECIPHer), said, \"Schools are operating in a climate of limited resource, with them having to organize their actions around ensuring performance against measures for which they are held accountable, perhaps to the neglect of measures which actually matter for young people.\"The need for increased school and practitioner-level autonomy and freedom was discussed at length throughout interviews and this will undoubtedly be key to the success of the new curriculum. But with such radical changes to how young people learn, giving those in the education profession the knowledge, skills and tools to implement the curriculum, as well as health and well-being outside of the curriculum, is also going to be vital.\"Interviews for the study included senior members of government and schools with a remit in either design of the curriculum or professional learning, Estyn and those with a multidisciplinary remit in health and education.The curriculum in Wales has experienced major reform with a substantially increased emphasis on Health and Well-being. It is now one of six Areas of Learning and Experience (AoLE) alongside Expressive Arts; Humanities; Languages, Literacy and Communication; Mathematics and Numeracy and Science and Technology.

  "text": "On the weekend in March when Brittany Glover would have turned 34, her mother stood on the same busy road in Atlanta where her daughter died six months earlier.          Glover, a flight attendant with a passion for clothes, was coming from an entertainment venue during the early morning of Sept. 19, 2022. She had lived in Atlanta for only 48 hours when she was hit by a driver while crossing Donald Lee Hollowell Parkway, which elected officials and activists call one of the most dangerous streets in the city. The driver fled and hasn't been identified.\"Brittany didn't have to die,\" her mother Valerie Handy-Carey said, surrounded by friends and supporters as speeding cars whizzed by. Atlanta, she said, needs to do more to protect pedestrians and cyclists.She's far from alone in her call to action.With pedestrian deaths in the U.S. at their highest in four decades, citizens across the nation are urging lawmakers to break from transportation spending focused on car culture. From Salt Lake City to Charlotte, North Carolina, frustrated residents are pushing for increased funding for public transportation and improvements that make it safer to travel by bike or on foot.\"We already hit the point of diminishing returns,\" said Roby Greenwald, a public health professor at Georgia State University. \"We're going to have to examine other transportation modes that make that easier or else we're just going to have to deal with increased congestion, increased traffic fatalities and increased air pollution emissions.\"Nationwide, the number of pedestrians killed in 2022 rose 13%, and cyclist fatalities were up 2% for the year, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\"There are plenty of people who must bike and walk for transportation because that's their only means of transportation,\" said Rachael Panik, a Georgia Tech transportation systems engineering researcher.Panik previously worked as a transportation planning consultant for cities across the southeast. She said there was unmet demand for biking and walking in most of them.\"More people want to bike, more people want to walk, but they can't because it's either not safe or the destinations that they need to get to are too far and they can't,\" she said.Quanisha Ball, 31, was struck by a car and killed in November while crossing a street on her way to work in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur. The driver was identified but never charged.      \"I wanted to cross that street to see how dangerous it is. It's dangerous,\" said Courtney Thompkins, Ball's mother. Pushing a button gives pedestrians less than a minute to cross seven or eight lanes of traffic, adding that speed bumps, better lighting and longer crossing times would help.Atlanta City Councilman Jason Dozier said he realized he could have been another victim\u2014he was hit by a car while riding a bike.\"That experience really did a lot to radicalize me,\" Dozier said.He and 10 council members have proposed zoning legislation to prevent drive-thrus and gas stations from being built around the Atlanta BeltLine, a bike and pedestrian trail that runs through numerous city neighborhoods.Some city leaders across the country are already taking big steps to reduce car traffic.                Valerie Handy-Carey stands with family members and city leaders on Donald Lee Hollowell Parkway on March 19, 2023, in Atlanta. Several months earlier, her daughter, Brittany Glover, was hit by a car and died while trying to cross the intersection. With pedestrian deaths in the U.S. at their highest in four decades, citizens across the nation are urging lawmakers to break from transportation spending focused on car culture. Atlanta, she said, needs to do more to protect pedestrians and cyclists. Credit: AP Photo/Sharon Johnson             In 2021, the city council in Charlotte, North Carolina, adopted a plan to expand their transit system by adding shaded bikeways, bus routes and commuter rail lines in the next two decades. One goal is to reduce single-person trips by 25%, said Shannon Binns, president of Sustain Charlotte, a nonprofit organization focused on local sustainability.\"It's an ambitious goal, but of course it will require us to really make a lot of different decisions budget-wise to give people those opportunities to get around without a car,\" Binns said.Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall has made pedestrian safety a priority for 2023 after her city saw an increase in fatalities in 2022 and a tragic start to 2023. In the span of a few weeks, two sets of kids on foot and a pair sharing a bicycle were all hit by drivers but fortunately survived, she said.\"The accidents that have happened from vehicles increasing means that we have to go beyond the way we've been operating,\" Mendenhall said.A local mobility advocacy group called Sweet Streets Salt Lake City has worked with the city council to drop the speed limit on residential streets and is pushing the city to create a network of byways that cater to walking, biking and jogging.\"We really do believe our policy choices are killing people, and the way we stop doing that is by changing those policies,\" Sweet Streets Board member Benjamin Wood said.Despite some encouraging signs, advocates face high hurdles to creating walkable and transit-friendly communities.The Utah Transit Authority implemented an on-demand service that is a combination of a public bus and ridesharing. It's been popular, but it's underfunded.\"We didn't realize it would be as wildly popular as it is, and now, we're turning away rides because we can't afford to run more service,\" the transit authority's transportation division director, John Larsen, said during a January work session.In Charlotte, city council members have complained about the lack of progress with the 2030 Transit Corridor System Plan.The city must gain local funding to access federal dollars for the mobility plan. One option is to create a referendum for a local sales tax, but city officials are already hearing it would be unlikely to win approval from the state legislature. Dana Fetton, a lobbyist for Charlotte's city government, recently told council members if they presented the transit plan as is to the legislature, it would be \"dead on arrival.\"Winning funding for safe or sustainable transportation projects is a challenge nationwide.The Georgia Department of Transportation first devotes resources to projects considered state priorities, such as interchange and bridge improvements. That leaves lower tier projects\u2014like improving the parkway where Glover was fatally struck in Atlanta\u2014to compete for funding.Donald Lee Hollowell Parkway had more than 1,900 crashes over the course of a decade before construction began to make it safer by narrowing parts of the roadway from four lanes to three, according to the Georgia Transportation Department. The changes won't affect the stretch where Glover was killed.Standing on a corner of the busy street with a handful of birthday balloons and flowers, Handy-Carey said she was worried about whether any improvements would come.\"I'm feeling that the state of Georgia, the city of Atlanta, Fulton County, didn't value me or my daughter's life,\" she said. \"Even after Brittany was killed, you still have more people dying. How many more people have to die?\"    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed without permission.

  "text": "To help learners of all ages understand how to safely observe the Oct. 14, 2023, annular solar eclipse and the April 8, 2024, total solar eclipse, NASA has released a new set of resources for educators.          My NASA Data, in collaboration with the NASA Heliophysics Education Activation Team (NASA HEAT), has released a new set of resources for educators centered around solar eclipses. My NASA Data allows students in grades 3 through 12 and their teachers to analyze and interpret NASA mission data. It also supports educators in the integration of authentic Earth systems data into their instruction.The My NASA Data solar eclipse resources include lesson plans, mini-lessons (shorter activities for quick engagement), student-facing web-based interactives, and a longer \"story map,\" which deepens the investigation of the phenomenon over multiple class periods. It can help educators engage learners with data collected during past solar eclipses, including maps and visualizations, and explain how data is used to predict future solar eclipses. Learners can analyze NASA mission data from the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO), the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) missions.The sun's energy interacts with all of Earth's systems. The sun produces a constant stream of particles called the solar wind, which flows outward from the sun in all directions, interacting with our planet and others, and creating the heliosphere, which encompasses and protects our solar system. Total solar eclipses provide rare opportunities for scientists to observe the sun's corona (outer atmosphere), where the solar wind originates. These observations help scientists predict space weather events that may impact human and robotic space exploration, and affect the technology on Earth that humans rely on every day. Learn more about the solar wind and how space weather affects Earth by exploring NASA HEAT's educational resources at https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/heat/home/.NASA conducts many experiments during solar eclipses, including monitoring atmospheric conditions, such as changes in air temperatures and clouds, and recording animal sounds. Learners can collect their own data on cloud and temperature observations during the upcoming solar eclipses with the GLOBE Observer Eclipse tool. My NASA Data is part of the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) Mission Earth, an international science and education program that provides students and the public worldwide with the opportunity to participate in data collection and the scientific process, and to contribute meaningfully to our understanding of the Earth system and global environment.

  "text": "Researchers of the HSE Centre for Language and Brain have investigated the impact of both auditory and visual noise on semantic processing during reading to determine if it results in a more superficial reading style that emphasizes the meanings of individual words over connections between them in a sentence.          It appears that noise does not affect reading comprehension but can cause a decrease in reading speed when even unintelligible conversations are occurring nearby. However, when exposed to visual noise, individuals tend to read slightly faster, possibly due to the irritating nature of the noise. The study findings have been published in PLOS ONE.In the theory of communication, noise is considered an inevitable aspect of the communication process. Broadly speaking, noise refers to any disturbance in the communication channel or any extraneous signal that interferes with the intended signal. Some examples of noise include advertisements on a website, nearby conversations, music, street performers like jugglers or dancers in a park, and so on.Noise can be either internal, resulting from conditions such as disease, aging, or brain damage, or external, originating from the environment. External noise can vary in modality, such as auditory or visual, and may or may not match the modality of the target signal. \"Background noise in the street matches the modality of having a conversation but conflicts with the modality of reading a book,\" the authors explain.Previous studies reported negative effects of both auditory and visual noise on reading fluency and comprehension. However, their findings do not present a comprehensive picture.Thus, studies of eye movements found longer fixations, a greater number of regressions and hence longer reading times when subjects were exposed to intelligible or unintelligible background speech. Additionally, older readers took longer when faced with non-linguistic visual noise, such as a certain type of font or blurred script.A negative impact on reading speed due to linguistic visual noise, such as short phrases appearing on the screen alongside target sentences, was also observed.The impact of noise on reading comprehension can differ based on whether it is visual or auditory. Available evidence suggests that visual noise does not interfere with reading comprehension, while auditory noise may or may not affect comprehension.      In particular, comprehension was found to be disrupted by background unintelligible speech, music with lyrics, and non-preferred background music. However, intelligible speech and bar-type noise did not seem to affect comprehension.According to the authors of the new paper, none of the studies investigating the effect of noise on reading have considered it in the framework of language processing models.Thus, according to a noisy-channel model, when reading under noisy conditions, people tend to process language at a surface level and rely more on the meaning of individual words rather than the way words are arranged in a sentence. This is to say, the authors explain, readers in a noisy environment attempt to infer the relationships between words based on the meanings they convey.On the other hand, the \"good-enough\" sentence processing model places a strong emphasis on semantic plausibility, ie on whether the text makes sense, as a key factor in sentence comprehension, regardless of any distracting noise. When a person encounters a sentence, two mechanisms of sentence processing are triggered in their mind simultaneously: a bottom-up, syntactically based algorithmic process and a top-down, semantically based process.\"Semantically based processing can be completed faster if the representation is semantically plausible and aligns with the person's real-world knowledge. By placing less emphasis on syntactic processing, readers may be conserving their cognitive resources,\" the authors explain.This assumption was confirmed in experiments using semantically implausible sentences, for example, \"The dog was bitten by the man\" or \"The fox that hunted the poacher stalked through the woods.\" Despite grasping the meanings of individual words, the subjects often failed to comprehend the true meaning of the entire phrase and thus missed the absurdity of the sentences and their inconsistency with the real world.Based on the above theoretical concepts and experimental evidence, good-enough processing prioritizing semantic information can be expected in noisy conditions of various types. The objective of the new study was to explore whether auditory and visual noise would result in a greater reliance on semantics during language processing\u2014in other words, whether reading can become more superficial in a noisy environment.The researchers conducted two experiments. The first experiment involved 38 women and 33 men with a mean age of 22 years, no vision or hearing problems, and no history of neurological or mental disorders.The subjects were asked to read Russian sentences containing a participial clause. The syntax of the experimental sentences was manipulated to make some of them plausible, such as \"Dima worked with the president's doctor treating small children,\" and others implausible, like \"Dima worked with the doctor of the president treating small children.\" Each experimental sentence was followed by a comprehension question.The researchers utilized an eye-tracking device to monitor reading fluency. The background noise used in the experiment consisted of a three-talker babble created by overlapping and merging Russian-language popular science podcasts. All non-speech sounds (such as music, crackling or rustling) were edited out. Each participant read the experimental sentences (which were presented in a randomized order) twice\u2014once with noise and once without noise.The second experiment involved 30 women and 40 men with a mean age of 23 years. None of them participated in the auditory noise experiment. The equipment and stimuli were identical to those used in the first experiment, but this time, the noise was visual and consisted of short Russian idioms and set phrases, two to five words in length, which appeared next to the target sentence on the screen, for example, \"a carriage and a small trolley\" [\"tons of something\"] and \"making an elephant out of a fly\" [\"exaggerating\"].The results of the first experiment showed that auditory noise affected the overall reading speed. The background babble caused longer fixation on the participial phrase and its preceding word. According to the researchers, longer initial fixations apparently compensated for the noise-induced cognitive load. The equally good comprehension in the presence of auditory noise observed in this study is consistent with the findings of previous studies that used bar-type noise, but contradicts those that used non-preferred music.In the second experiment, the researchers found a paradoxical increase in the overall reading speed when visual noise was present. \"The increase in reading speed may have been driven by the participants' desire to complete the task quickly, possibly due to the discomfort caused by the visual noise during reading,\" say the authors.At the same time, no significant effect of noise on comprehension accuracy was found. The study participants were able to read sentences even faster while preserving a high comprehension rate in the presence of visual noise.The findings of this study partially confirm those of earlier studies. Indeed, semantic processing is faster than syntactic processing for sentence comprehension. But neither auditory nor visual noise increased the readers' reliance on semantics, meaning that their reading did not become more superficial.These results, observed for the first time, do not support either the \"noisy-channel\" or the \"good-enough\" processing models. According to the authors, this inconsistency does not necessarily indicate that the models in question are incorrect, but rather that further study on this topic is warranted.

  "text": "When individuals share videos about surprise reunions with their intimate partners on the internet, the reaction from viewers may not be the roses and unicorns the posters expected. Viewers' responses to shared videos have the potential to shape offline relationships, a case study of one such video found.          In a paper published in the journal New Media and Society, Emily A. Mendelson, a graduate student in communication at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, used the recent \"couch guy\" video as a lens for exploring how online audiences form intimate networks of strangers united by shared content, use digital tools to make sense of relationships, and reinforce social scripts and behavioral expectations of romantic partners.A college student named Robbie achieved instant notoriety as the couch guy when his high-school girlfriend Lauren posted a video to TikTok in September 2021 showing his reaction to her surprise visit to him at college.Where some viewers saw a tender moment of speechlessness from Robbie at his girlfriend's unexpected entrance, thousands of skeptics saw a probable cheater who was dumbfounded and slow to react when his girlfriend walked in and caught him sitting on a couch with three women, according to the study.Attracting over 65 million views online and even the attention of the Today show and a condom manufacturer, the couch guy video chalked up more than 5.3 million likes, 134,000 polarized comments and more than 400,000 shares from sighing romantics and armchair detectives alike at the time of Mendelson's study.As the video's popularity grew, Mendelson wondered how offline relationships might be affected when videos of private moments go viral. Prior research had found that when individuals posted content about their intimate relationships online, their dyad might become a triad, with the online audience becoming a third member in the relationship.\"I believe one of the main reasons the couch guy video became so popular is people noticed that Robbie's reaction wasn't a typical response\u2014he didn't seem excited to see her at first and was slow to get up and embrace her\u2014and that didn't conform with the social scripts that define the behavioral expectations for romantic partners,\" Mendelson said.The ambiguity of Robbie's reaction stirred strong emotions in viewers, spawning a flurry of memes, derivative videos, and duets\u2014viewer-created videos posted side-by-side with the original in which viewers painstakingly analyzed his behavior and body language and that of others shown in the video.      For the study, Mendelson analyzed the top 100 viewer comments and the three most popular derivative videos and duets created and posted by other TikTok users. The original video and the viewer-created derivatives were all set to the same Ellie Goulding love song, \"Still Falling for You.\"While the original video was earnest and poetic in tone, Mendelson found that the derivative videos were divided into two distinct camps: serious renditions that showed people with \"better reactions\" such as excitement to surprise reunions that conformed with culturally defined social scripts and behavioral expectations, and parodies that lampooned blatantly unfaithful partners being caught in the act.\"The original video is serious and genuine in its tone and presentation,\" Mendelson said. \"The creator wants everyone to look at this moment and the surprise that she (orchestrated). However, all of the derivatives are exaggerated\u2014they're trying to make fun of the original or show different reactions. And the comments are all alluding to infidelity.\"The manufacturer of a popular condom even jumped into the fray by posting a comment from its verified account facetiously asking, \"What are those (colorful) foils on the table?\" Mendelson said.Lauren responded to viewers' comments by saying that she had only wanted to share a touching moment in her relationship by posting the video and was \"heartbroken\" at viewers' allegations of infidelity and their urging her to acknowledge it and break up with Robbie.Online audiences may perceive participants in shared videos as actors delivering performances rather than real people, prior research has found. Because the couch guy video raises many questions in viewers' minds, they feel compelled to \"know the ending,\" prompting them to latch onto possible clues such as body language that help them make sense of the relationships and events shown, Mendelson said.Viewers\u2014both individuals and corporations\u2014may overstep social boundaries \"to search for answers, facilitate drama and craft a narrative for entertainment at the expense of those in the relationship,\" Mendelson wrote. \"The obsession with sleuthing and unearthing the truth has been referred to by a prior researcher as 'mob justice and vigilante detective work typically reserved for, say, unmasking the Zodiac killer, except weaponized against normal people.'\"Accordingly, Robbie lamented the viewer backlash to the video. At the height of its popularity, Robbie said he, Lauren and their friends were inundated with requests for information and unsolicited advice, and viewers seemed to feel as though they had permission to invade the couple's privacy.The condom company's decision to seize a potential marketing opportunity associated with the video's popularity reflects how corporations and social media platforms can co-opt posted content, transforming people's relationships into property the platform can present however they choose to further their own interests, Mendelson said.Despite the unwelcome attention, the lucrative opportunity the video's popularity presented was not lost on Lauren and Robbie either, Mendelson noted. Upon a suggestion from Lauren's father, they designed and began selling Couch Guy T-shirts through a link posted to Lauren's TikTok profile.Accordingly, Mendelson concluded that \"TikTok users who go viral tailor their content to what audiences expect and enjoy, creating an endless loop that feeds into the capitalization of public intimacy.\" More information:Emily A Mendelson, Sensemaking and public intimacy on TikTok: How viral videos influence interpersonal relationships offline, New Media & Society (2023).

  "text": "Reading about climate-induced immigration prompted negative, nativist attitudes among people toward the affected migrants\u2014an unintended, perhaps even paradoxical effect of many delivering the original messages, according to researchers at the University of Michigan and elsewhere.          The findings, the researchers say, raise cautionary flags for reporters, advocates and other communicators in their work related to forced migration caused by global climate change.The research was published in Climatic Change and represents one of the first known experimental tests of messaging about the effects of climate-induced immigration on opinions about climate change and immigration.\"Our studies uncovered a conundrum: People who already knew about how climate change may spur migration tended to want to take actions to help immigrants and help slow climate change. But telling people about the connection between climate and migration had the opposite effect,\" said Kaitlin Raimi, associate professor at U-M's Ford School of Public Policy.Raimi and colleagues surveyed U.S. residents both male and female, with most being white and having at least some college education. The research incorporates two studies: A correlational pilot study consisting of 350 participants and an experimental messaging study incorporating more than 1,000.Initial results of the pilot were promising: Those aware of the connection between climate change and immigration also reported greater perceived climate concerns and policy support as well as more positive immigration attitudes and greater support for immigrants.However, results from the main study provided preliminary evidence that exposing participants to information about climate-induced immigration\u2014relative to solely climate change or immigration\u2014did not increase prosocial responses on climate change or immigration. In fact, it resulted in more negative attitudes toward immigrants.Researchers also were surprised the backfiring effect was present among both Republicans and Democrats\u2014though to a lesser degree among the latter group.The authors say it's possible that learning about climate-induced immigration engenders an initial, defensive reaction, followed by a longer-term change in attitudes toward a more prosocial direction. More work is needed to understand the conditions that can spur empathic vs. nativist responses.Dealing with the disconnect now is critical, as global climate change starts to cause widespread forced migration to countries in the Global North, such as the United States.\"One thing that I'd hope reporters take away is that stories about climate migration may not have their likely intended effect of increasing public concern about climate change and empathy toward migrants,\" Gillis said. \"Instead, they may invoke a nativist response, making people view migrants more negatively and possibly less human.\"The research article advises caution among communicators, and recommends that fellow researchers \"focus intently on developing effective methods of inoculating the public from nativist reactions to climate-induced immigration.\"\"If the goal is spur action on climate change and helping migrants, communicators may do better by focusing on these issues separately,\" Raimi said. \"We need more work to find better ways to talk about climate-induced migration that don't result in a backlash against immigrants.\" More information:Ash Gillis et al, Climate change\u2013induced immigration to the United States has mixed influences on public support for climate change and migrants, Climatic Change (2023).

  "answer_squad": " empathy",
  "text": "Globally, critical thinking (CT) is regarded as a highly desirable cognitive skill that enables a person to question, analyze, and assess an idea or theory from multiple perspectives. CT has become an integral and mandatory part of global educational curricula, but its definition varies across contexts and cultural backgrounds.          To assess the implementation of CT, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) conducts the Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS). In a 2018 survey (TALIS 2018), only 12.6% of lower secondary schoolteachers in Japan taught CT, compared to the global average of 58.1%.To understand this gap, Assistant Professor Kazuyuki Nomura from Chiba University, Japan, set out to understand the reason underlying Japan's dismal performance in TALIS 2018. The study was published in Educational Philosophy and Theory.\"Japan's poor scoring in teaching CT puzzled me after I read the TALIS 2018 Results. Granted, CT varies from context to context, but little research has been conducted to understand what CT means in Japanese classrooms. Therefore, I took it on,\" explains Dr. Nomura, an expert in intercultural education, speaking of his motivation for the study.In this qualitative study, Dr. Nomura conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 certified Japanese schoolteachers from diverse backgrounds, including one from a school for children with special educational needs (SENs), between May and July 2022 to understand their perspectives on CT and the outcomes of TALIS 2018.All participants agreed that the Japanese adjective \"hihanteki\" for the English word \"critical\" had a negative undertone, making most teachers hesitant about introducing CT to their classrooms. Most of the participants also felt that the use of \"hihanteki shikoo\" as a direct translation of the words \"critical thinking\" in the TALIS 2018 was not correct. Many teachers were unaware that the national curriculum guidelines contain the concept of CT. Teachers who knew about it and had tried integrating it into their pedagogy were in a sheer minority.By contrast, multidimensional-multiperspective thinking (MMT), which is a facet of CT, enjoys more acceptance and popularity in Japan since the curriculum guidelines explicitly promote MMT. The study found that while most participants shied away from implementing CT, they were comfortable with MMT and used it regularly in their teaching. Additionally, almost all participants suggested that teaching MMT depends on socioeconomic status (SES), and that teaching MMT in low-SES schools was challenging.Moreover, \"empathy\" is a hidden, central pillar of the Japanese school curriculum. All participants concurred that empathy is a core value in Japanese education, and most of them felt that it is impossible to practice CT or MMT without teaching empathy. Coupling MMT with empathy increased the autonomy of schoolteachers in Japan. They struck a delicate balance between the national curriculum, the school culture, and their teaching practice. As a result, they managed to circumvent the power of OECD-led global education.Still, Dr. Nomura maintains that the merits of global CT can be combined with the Japanese teachers' emic understanding of CT to get the best of both worlds. Through CT skills and empathy, Japanese teachers can enable a growingly diverse student population to think big and beyond the perimeters of Japan.Although CT and politics go hand-in-hand, as per the law, Japanese schools cannot teach politically controversial topics and must maintain neutrality. To remedy this, he recommends that teachers use non-Japanese or fictional examples to implement CT in their classrooms.\"As Japan is now becoming increasingly multicultural, teachers could use CT skills to help children think about Japan's future, enhance open-mindedness, and live together with others with equity and dignity,\" suggests Dr. Nomura.For future research, classroom observations could be the best candidate, given that MMT is a core educational goal in the current national curriculum. The results of this study could thus help spark a much-needed discussion about CT teaching in Japan and elsewhere.

  "text": "Zachary Zhong had heard his grandparents' stories about the Japanese invasion in 1944 of neighboring counties in his hometown in China. As the Japanese army continued their advance, civilians were killed and injured, while others fled the invaders' path, some taking shelter in his family's ancestral home.          Those events lodged deep into locals' memories. Curious about the impact of a re-ignited territorial dispute between Japan and China in 2012, Zhong, now an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, looked at what happened to car sales in the province of Guangxi around the same time. Guangxi had the highest civilian casualty rate of any Chinese province during the war.\"Across generations, those historical memories get passed down to present-day consumers,\" said Prof. Zhong.The work is published in Marketing Science.The invaded counties saw a 6.8% drop in sales of Japanese cars and a 5.3% increase in Chinese cars following the height of the 2012 dispute, compared to Guangxi counties that hadn't experienced invasion. Those effects were stronger for larger and more expensive cars and in counties with larger shares of people born before 1936. The impact was not short-lived, lasting more than two years.Prof. Zhong and co-investigator Nan Chen of the National University of Singapore looked at China's vehicle registration data for the top 100 bestselling car models as well as provincial archival data on losses and casualties by county during the Imperial Japanese Army's \"Operation Ichi-Go.\" Between late September 1944 and early January 1945, the Imperial Japanese Army occupied about two-thirds of Guangxi.China-Japan relations normalized in 1972. However, a longstanding dispute remained over the sovereignty of a group of islands in the East China Sea. The dispute flared in August and September 2012 after the Japanese government nationalized the main islands and there were large protests in many Chinese cities.The car purchase effects were seen despite the fact that the Japanese cars were produced in China through joint Chinese-Japanese ventures. However, models with less recognizably Japanese names did not suffer as much.Meanwhile, sales of a local independent brand created through a Japanese joint venture were not impacted by the \"history effect,\" providing clues for how foreign brands can mitigate the impacts of past conflicts on consumer behavior.\"Start a local brand,\" said Prof. Zhong. \"You can take advantage of the local association.\"Foreign companies can also try to play down the associations of their products with their country of origin.But in the current era of geopolitical tensions and protectionism, perhaps the best way to avoid the business hangover of history is this: \"Our paper shows you should not invade other countries,\" said Prof. Zhong. \"If you do that, people will hold a long grudge.\" More information:Nan Chen et al, History and Country-of-Origin Effects, Marketing Science (2023).

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the region where the earliest documented kiss occurred?",
  "answer_squad": " Mesopotamia",
  "text": "Recent research has hypothesized that the earliest evidence of human lip kissing originated in a very specific geographical location in South Asia 3,500 years ago, from where it may have spread to other regions, simultaneously accelerating the spread of the herpes simplex virus 1.          But according to Dr. Troels Pank Arb\u00f8ll and Dr. Sophie Lund Rasmussen, who in a new article in the journal Science, draw on a range of written sources from the earliest Mesopotamian societies, kissing was already a well-established practice 4,500 years ago in the Middle East. And probably much earlier, moving the earliest documentation for kissing back 1,000 years compared to what was previously acknowledged in the scientific community.\"In ancient Mesopotamia, which is the name for the early human cultures that existed between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers in present-day Iraq and Syria, people wrote in cuneiform script on clay tablets. Many thousands of these clay tablets have survived to this day, and they contain clear examples that kissing was considered a part of romantic intimacy in ancient times, just as kissing could be part of friendships and family members' relations,\" says Dr. Troels Pank Arb\u00f8ll, an expert on the history of medicine in Mesopotamia. \"Therefore, kissing should not be regarded as a custom that originated exclusively in any single region and spread from there but rather appears to have been practiced in multiple ancient cultures over several millennia.\"Dr. Sophie Lund Rasmussen adds, \"In fact, research into bonobos and chimpanzees, the closest living relatives to humans, has shown that both species engage in kissing, which may suggest that the practice of kissing is a fundamental behavior in humans, explaining why it can be found across cultures.\"Kissing as potential transmitter of diseaseIn addition to its importance for social and sexual behavior, the practice of kissing may have played an unintentional role in the transmission of microorganisms, potentially causing viruses to spread among humans.However, the suggestion that the kiss may be regarded as a sudden biological trigger behind the spread of particular pathogens is more doubtful. The spread of the herpes simplex virus 1, which researchers have suggested could have been accelerated by the introduction of the kiss, is a case in point:\"There is a substantial corpus of medical texts from Mesopotamia, some of which mention a disease with symptoms reminiscent of the herpes simplex virus 1,\" Dr. Arb\u00f8ll remarks.He adds that the ancient medical texts were influenced by a variety of cultural and religious concepts, and it therefore must be emphasized that they cannot be read at face value.\"It is nevertheless interesting to note some similarities between the disease known as bu\u02beshanu in ancient medical texts from Mesopotamia and the symptoms caused by herpes simplex infections. The bu'shanu disease was located primarily in or around the mouth and throat, and symptoms included vesicles in or around the mouth, which is one of the dominant signs of herpes infection.\"\"If the practice of kissing was widespread and well-established in a range of ancient societies, the effects of kissing in terms of pathogen transmission must likely have been more or less constant,\" says Dr. Rasmussen.Dr. Arb\u00f8ll and Dr. Rasmussen conclude that future results emerging from research into ancient DNA, inevitably leading to discussions about complex historical developments and social interactions\u2014such as kissing as a driver of early disease transmission\u2014will benefit from an interdisciplinary approach.

  "question_race": " What is the purpose of the passage?",
  "answer_race": " To provide information about the debate on the debt ceiling.",
  "question_squad": " What is the debt ceiling?",
  "answer_squad": " a limit Congress places on the amount of money the federal government can borrow to pay its bills",
  "text": "Much ado about the debt ceiling the past couple months. As the issue plays on (and on and on) in the news cycle, a reset is in order. Let's get to the nuts and bolts of an issue that\u2014believe it or don't\u2014can be understood even by the numbers-averse among us.          In the following Q&A, UCR News addresses the basics and calls on two UCR experts\u2014economist Marcelle Chauvet and political scientist Indridi Indridason\u2014for the more nuanced stuff.Q: What's a debt ceiling?UCR News: The government spends more than it brings in through taxes and other revenue. So it must borrow money. A debt ceiling is a limit Congress places on the amount of money the federal government can borrow to pay its bills. It now owes $31 trillion, and the borrowing cap is $31.381 trillion.Q: What do the respective political parties want to do about the debt ceiling?UCR News: Democrats say Congress must raise the debt ceiling to pay existing bills\u2014spending already approved by Congress. Republicans counter that continuing to raise the debt ceiling perpetuates a cycle of more spending and borrowing. And so the GOP wants a raise in the debt ceiling to be tied to spending cuts.Q: With Democrats and Republicans in a stalemate, the question has been raised whether the president has power to raise the debt limit without congressional approval. That power may be provided by the 14th amendment, a section of which reads: 'The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law... shall not be questioned.' Does the 14th amendment argument hold? Indridason: The 14th amendment reads like the president has the authority to do so\u2014or, in fact, that there really is no other option than to keep servicing the debt. Do I think we would be better if Biden took that option? Probably. It doesn't seem like a good idea to give any political party an opportunity to hold the economy hostage. While chances are that the debt ceiling will be lifted in time, negotiating over the role of government with the risk of default in the background is probably not conducive to rational decision-making. So \"taking the 14th\" could represent a solution to not just this but future debt ceiling crises\u2014if the courts side with the 14th amendment.On the other hand, now that the 14th amendment argument seems to have gained some traction, maybe that is enough. That is, the threat to invoke the 14th amendment might be enough to discourage parties in the future from taking the debt hostage or, perhaps, result in more moderate demands. If that is the case, 'taking the 14th' now might leave us worse off, if the courts do not side with the 14th amendment.      Q: The U.S. spending deficit and battles over the debt ceiling are a constant. Does that translate to high risk for lenders, or do they just assume the U.S. is always going to pay its bills?Chauvet: The U.S. debt (Treasury bond) is considered a safe heaven, one of the safest assets in the world. However, the constant struggles regarding the debt ceiling do cause some (minor) stress in the market, and investors reassess the risk of default, even if it is a very small probability event. Standard & Poors downgraded the U.S. debt in 2011 due to the battles regarding the debt ceiling around that time. Since then the U.S. debt has been more costly to the U.S. government (higher yield) compared to the German debt (Bunds). Thus, the debt ceiling discussions do increase the higher risk premium even if in a minor way. Lenders do assume that the debt will be paid, though. The probability of default is very very small, but it is higher than zero, so the risk increases even if just by a small amount.Q: What are the longer-term impacts\u2014if a couple months or more goes by and the debt ceiling isn't raised?Chauvet: This would cause instability, volatility in the markets, speculations. But the market does expect that the debt ceiling will eventually be raised. This event is mostly a political bargaining between the parties. There is no substantial longer term impact if the discussions on the debt ceiling are prolonged, although in the past the government went without paying employees and some contractors for a short time in 2011\u2014one of the reasons why it triggered the downgrading of the U.S. debt. The government will probably be more cautious in not letting the situation get to this point again, as the debt risk premium could increase again.Q: The United States' debt of $31 trillion is six times what it was at the start of the 21st century, and increasing by $1.3 trillion per year. What's up? UCR News: Since 2000, Congress has borrowed money to finance wars, pay for tax cuts, pay for Social Security and Medicare, and take emergency measures to survive two recessions. The government during the George W. Bush administration borrowed to pay for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan without raising taxes or issuing war bonds (which add less debt because the interest is lower). That trend continued during the Obama administration. And Obama made a deal with Republicans to make Bush administration tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 permanent. In 2018, tax cuts from the Trump administration kicked in.Q: Do tax cuts lead to raising the national debt?Indridason: Tax cuts do lead to greater national debt if not accompanied by equally large (or larger) cuts in government spending.Q: What kind of changes would have to happen to halt the spending deficit? Can it continue to increase indefinitely, or is crash-and-burn inevitable at some point?Chauvet: The spending deficit would not halt but reduce smoothly, so that it does not have a large negative impact on the economy during a time in which the economy is weakening with the increase in interest rates, high inflation, decreasing real income. However, the deficit will need to be reduced soon. Taxes will eventually need to be increased and/or government spending decreased. Note that inflation is already a tax on consumers (seigniorage), and the debt is being reduced in real terms with the high inflation.

The study analyzed more than half a million tweets from 2017 to 2022 and identified the key topics and trends communicated in connection with CSR on Twitter. The study, published in PeerJ Computer Science, is titled \"Global analysis of Twitter communication in corporate social responsibility area: sustainability, climate change, and waste management.\"\"Our results aid enterprises in developing communication strategies that support the company's existence as a socially responsible subject and promote the management of the company's reputation in accordance with the CSR philosophy,\" write the authors. \"The study also opens up possibilities for further research for other social media, such as Instagram or LinkedIn.\"The study found that the most commonly mentioned topics on Twitter in connection with CSR were sustainability, climate change, and waste management, highlighting the growing importance of environmental issues to companies and their stakeholders. However, the study also found that charity remained the largest single topic, indicating that social impact is still a key area of focus for companies.The analysis also identified areas of growth and decline in CSR communication on Twitter. The areas of ESG (environmental, social, and governance), social impact, and charity were identified as growth areas, while green and philanthropy were identified as decreasing in importance. The findings of the study have important implications for companies looking to improve their CSR efforts and engage with their stakeholders.

  "answer_squad": " The Conversation",
  "text": "In just a few months, higher education has moved from being afraid of how generative AI like ChatGPT could help students cheat, to cautiously embracing it by allowing students to use it under certain circumstances.          In getting to grips with how AI will change education and society, we've heard mainly from educators, university management and other experts. But what about students, whose studies, careers, relationships and futures will be most impacted by AI?We are academics from universities in Sydney and Hong Kong, specializing in higher education practice and research.Over the last two months, we have asked students their thoughts about how AI should be used in their education through questionnaires and focus groups. This includes a survey of more than 450 students in Hong Kong and pilot focus group panels with 13 Australian students.Here are some the key themes to emerge so far from this ongoing research.AI makes knowledge easier to accessStudents recognized that ChatGPT was helpful for summarizing, brainstorming, explaining and suggesting. They mentioned how it made it easier to learn difficult topics in a conversational way.As one told us: \"I've had a mostly positive experience [\u2026] Explanations of new concepts are always really well done and you [can] ask it to explain something a little more clearly. \"Others mentioned it helps them learn during classes: \"To grab quick definitions, explain concepts to me, and assist in discussions when the conversation goes quiet or people are confused.\"Students are aware of the risksThe more experience students had with ChatGPT, the more nuanced their views were. One student noted ChatGPT \"will miss out on important points or misunderstand\".\"That's why I am not relying on it for assignments, instead it is very helpful for my daily learning.\"Another went further to say that using AI improved their critical thinking: \"I simply put the whole assignment in to see what it would generate. The answer was quite abysmal [\u2026] This was really valuable information because I developed critical thinking while critiquing its work.\"Another student added, \"I think students really need to understand that AI is not always correct\".In the survey of more than 450 students across Hong Kong universities, 80% said they understood its limitations and potential inaccuracies.      AI is key to their future careersStudents talked about how AI could remove less desirable parts of work, to focus on more important thinking.\"Busywork can be done for us, and will be done for us in our future careers.\"As one student put it: \"For learning, it's [like] an upgraded version of Google. Let's say if you are new to a topic, you can ask ChatGPT questions and treat it as interactive Wikipedia.\"Students said they wanted their teachers to teach them \"how to best use AI tools and make AI tools a common part of education, just like PowerPoint and Excel\".This includes educating them about risks, biases and limitations so they can understand the technology they will inevitably be using.Students agreed guidelines about \"what happens if AI is used\" are needed going forward. As one noted:\"Please do not assume the worst of us. Rather, teach us how to use this technology in the right way and learn alongside it.\"Concerns about equity and ethicsStudents were concerned about the disadvantages that lack of access to ChatGPT would mean for some people.\"All students should have the same resources as one another, being of a lower income should not be a reason why other students can do their assessments more efficiently.\"Others noted AI was not necessarily free, as there were costs of accessing premium tools. Schools are also taking different approaches globally and locally, with some banning and some embracing AI. This could widen existing inequities.Where to from here?The Australian Universities Accord discussion paper highlights AI as a significant opportunity, and challenge.This is something we cannot ignore. And students want universities to actively engage with AI for their benefit.They do so knowing this is a \"difficult time\" for their teachers.\"The traditional ways of learning [\u2026] are changing. But this technology is now our present and the future, we need our teachers to prepare us for it.\"But they are worried about their futures and they want their education to prepare them for life after study, in a world that is changing rapidly.\"If university wants to prepare people for later in life, why not encourage usage of a tool that would be available to us outside a strict academic setting?\"We need to work with students, industries, communities, and governments to figure out how we can help our students engage productively and responsibly with AI. This is urgent work as the pace of AI development accelerates and has wide-ranging impacts across society perhaps beyond its developers' understanding.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards forced marriage?",
  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the minimum age for marriage in England and Wales?",
  "answer_squad": " 18",
  "text": "A study has revealed for the first time that the crime of forced marriage remains rife in England and Wales.          The research on Forced Marriage Protection Orders, a civil injunction designed to prevent forced marriages, uncovers the scale of the problem and proposes new measures urgently needed to better protect victims.Forced marriage, where one or both people do not or cannot consent to a marriage, is classified as a form of domestic violence and often leads to further crimes, including rape. The study, jointly led by the University of Lincoln and University of Bristol, highlights the pressure forced marriage puts on police forces and local authorities nationwide.Forced Marriage Protection Orders (FMPOs) are now being granted by family courts daily in a bid to curb the issue. Over the past decade, around 250\u2014which amounts to approximately five per week\u2014have been approved each year.Co-lead author Aisha K. Gill, Professor of Criminology at the University of Bristol, said, \"This research shows us for the first time how Forced Marriage Protection Orders are a double-edged sword. Although they can prevent forced marriage and protect victims, these orders can also increase the risk of honor-based violence, including abduction, physical assaults, and rape.\"Other key findings from the research included:The most common age of women and men subject to forced marriages was 16\u201321, but girls (and boys) as young as 11 were also victims.People with disabilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, Trans, queer+ (LGBTQ+) were especially vulnerable to forced marriage.While it is commonly believed that forced marriages occur in South Asian or Middle Eastern diaspora communities, they were also found to occur in Irish, Nigerian and Somali communities, among others.In extreme cases, efforts to prevent arrange marriage have resulted in perpetrators fleeing the country, kidnapping victims, issuing threats of violence, and committing torture and rape.Since the minimum age of marriage in England and Wales was raised to 18 earlier this year, any conduct undertaken to cause a child to marry is forced marriage, even if coercion is not used.Project lead Sundari Anitha, Professor of Gender, Violence, and Work, at the University of Lincoln, said, \"This recent change adds to the steps that have been taken to prevent forced marriage but we need to ensure that existing provisions deliver safety for victims. Although the injunctive remedy offered by Forced Marriage Protection Orders has great promise, more work must be done to fully realize the potential.\"      The research used data from nearly 600 case files from police forces nationwide. Around 40 FMPO reported judgements were analyzed and the study also comprised more than 50 interviews with practitioners as well as victims/survivors of forced marriage. This provided an in-depth overview of the gaps in protection and possible ways to address them.The main recommendations were to:Gain an understanding of more subtle forms of coercion, such as emotional pressure, and new types, for example institutional imprisonment in another country.Implement better and more co-ordinated safeguarding between different agencies which also continues after the FMPO has been obtained.Systems to flag up and follow up when FMPOs expire, as this is often when the pressure to marry resumes.The interviews with victims/survivors and analysis of police case files helped the researchers gain unique insights into various traumatic situations of forced marriage. One case involved a 17-year-old Indian girl, living in the U.K., who was raped. Instead of supporting her through the ordeal, her parents regarded it as a source of family shame and pressured her to agree to marriage, which was presented as the only way to overcome this. After initial resistance, she eventually gave in and agreed to be engaged but with the marriage looming reached out to the police. Support was provided with the resulting FMPO allowing her to avoid the marriage and leave home to live in secure accommodation.Another concerned a 20-year-old Saudi woman, brought up in the U.K., who confided to her family she was in relationship with and living with another woman. She was tricked into moving back in with her parents, where she overheard their plans to send her back to Saudi Arabia and marry her off. Her father choked her unconscious repeatedly while performing exorcisms to rid her of \"demons\" and she was forced to drink and bathe in \"holy water.\" With the help of her girlfriend, she escaped and applied for an FMPO and eventually managed to be housed safely in a secret location. Today she is rebuilding a life with her girlfriend.There was also a 21-year-old Somali man living in London, who secured his parents' reluctant consent for him to marry his Somali girlfriend. But on discovering that their son had been smoking and disapproving of his wife's clothing and westernized ways, he was escorted back to Somalia under the pretense of his grandmother being ill. There, he was incarcerated in a \"cultural rehabilitation center\" and put under duress to divorce his wife and remarry a woman of their choice. After trying to escape without success, his wife contacted the police and they sought an FMPO, which stipulated that the man's parents had to bring him back to the U.K. where he was reunited with his wife.Professor Anitha said, \"These orders are different from other injunctions for domestic violence, where the victim has left the abusive relationship and the injunction prevents the perpetrator from contacting the victim. Most people who seek them continue to live in their family home or remain in touch with the perpetrators, their parents.\"These young people are trying to balance their need to protect themselves from a forced marriage while avoiding a complete family estrangement. When services continue to work together after an order is granted, they can create a protective shield for continued safety. If orders are treated as an end in themselves, it can expose victims to further serious harm.\"Professor Gill added, \"Factors such as a lack of knowledge about the complicated coercive pressures on the victims/survivors, fissures between the agencies, missteps in multi-agency working and the gatekeeping of services due to financial constraints often impeded the provision of effective support.\"Where agencies worked together and practitioners understood these lived realities, the risks associated with Forced Marriage Protection Orders were minimized.\"The report findings were presented to MPs and representatives from a range of frontline safeguarding services at the House of Commons this week.

  "text": "Emotions are affective reactions we experience to stimuli. They can be positive, such as feeling relaxed or enjoying what you are doing (shopping or going for a walk, for example); and negative, such as being angry, sad or worried.          But are we happy, irritated or depressed in the same way in different countries and cultures? It seems that the answer is a resounding no: different levels of positive and negative emotions differ according to where we come from.In a study involving more than 50,000 adults in Spain, Mexico, India, China, Russia, Ghana, South Africa, Finland and Poland, the day reconstruction method assessed the extent to which people felt worried, irritated or angry, rushed, depressed, tense or stressed; or calm, relaxed and enjoying themselves.The results revealed that people in Finland, China, Ghana and South Africa express fewer negative emotions. As for positive emotions, they are more homogeneous across countries, with the participants from African nations having higher values.In China, emotions are considered pathogenic factorsCulture can influence the way people showcase their emotions. For example, Chinese emotions and their expression differ from other cultures in their low frequency, intensity and duration. In fact, there is a long history of considering emotions as pathogenic, understood as factors that disturb the normal functioning of the body. This tradition consequently discourages their expression.Finns tend to be emotionally reserved and rarely score high on the expression of joy or anger. In fact, the Finnish concept sisu means to demonstrate strength, stoicism and resilience. Social norms in some African countries analyzed in another study (Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe) point to negative emotions as undesirable.Taking social factors into account is important, as promoting and improving people's emotional well-being should be a key aspect of public social agendas.And are these factors associated with emotions in the same way in different countries? Despite differences in the extent to which emotions are reported and the cultural, social and economic gap, we agree on many social aspects. Among them, unwanted loneliness stands out, i.e., the discrepancy between the relationships a person has and the ones he or she would like to have. This is one of the greatest enemies of emotional well-being wherever we live.      Loneliness increases feelings of depressionThe emotion most affected by loneliness is depression, especially in European countries. Higher levels of loneliness correspond to higher levels of depression and lower levels of positive emotions. We are talking about feelings and emotions of depression: feeling depressed is not the same as suffering from depression.Surprisingly, in only one country, Mexico, loneliness was not associated with any emotion. Previous evidence affirms that the negative consequences of loneliness in the Mexican population are mitigated by social interactions and family support. Indeed, less than 1% of participants lived alone, a possible indicator of the relevance of family ties. This indicates that the effects of loneliness vary culturally.Social participation is associated with higher positive emotions and trust in society with lower negative emotions. Trust creates a sense of security, bringing calmness in daily life and stimulating cooperation, increasing the perception of social support. Living alone leads to greater feelings of depression, without being associated with other emotions.Perhaps it is the subjective experience of loneliness that has the greatest influence on people's day-to-day emotions, rather than an objective measure such as living alone, which may or may not be desired.Human beings are naturally inclined to social relationships and social exchange. Social aspects are relevant to emotions in all countries, but the form and strength of their relationships depend on the country and culture.Taking into account the different cultural settings, policies to promote emotional well-being should be implemented. For example, social participation could be intensified, involving people in their community through volunteering and facilitating access to leisure activities. Another interesting strategy would be to ensure social relations in all countries to avoid loneliness and isolation, as well as to increase the security of neighborhoods to foster social trust.At the same time, it would be necessary to create an international dialogue on loneliness in order to raise awareness of the problem, identify it and reduce its impact on people's emotional well-being.

  "answer_squad": " UNSW Face Test",
  "text": "Identifying faces is a crucial part of police work, and while training can bring about small improvements in accuracy, superior face recognition abilities are something you are born with, past research has shown.          Now, with the help of research from UNSW Sydney, the NSW Police Force has been able to identify 38 of its own exceptional performers, opening the possibility that their special abilities could be put to use in areas like forensics and counter-terrorism.In a study published May 17 in the journal PLOS ONE, UNSW researchers described how they enlisted 1,600 members of NSW Police to undertake a series of online face matching and memory tests.The officers sat the Glasgow Face Matching Test, where participants are asked to declare a pair of faces the same or different; the Cambridge Face Memory Test, which measures the ability to learn and remember unfamiliar faces; and the UNSW Face Test, arguably the world's most challenging face recognition test, that combines face matching with memory exercises.The 38 who were selected performed well above average in all three and were identified as super-recognizers\u2014people with uncanny abilities to recognize and remember unfamiliar faces. Such people are estimated to make up about 2% of the population, putting the 38 of the 1,600 original police participants in this same ratio.Associate Professor David White, who led the study, says this isn't the first time that police and security agencies have tried to get the best people for the job where correct identification can have real consequences for the safety of others. The London Metropolitan Police was the first to try recruiting super-recognizers from its ranks, but this selection process is not on the scientific record.\"As far as we are aware, this is the first research of its kind to actually run through the whole recruitment process internally, within NSW Police, and report it in a scientific journal,\" Prof. White says.\"We wanted to see if they could repeat the performance that they did on the online tests by making some tasks that modeled aspects of face identification tasks performed in forensic settings.\"We also wanted to find out, given that they're already good with faces, if that extends to other related tasks relevant to the job. For example, when looking at CCTV images where faces are not particularly visible, can they also pick up on cues to identify from the body?\"A final test they gave the police officers was to see if they could remember the context that the faces were remembered from.\"In the real world, it's important to say, yes, that person is familiar, but also to be able to recall where exactly that face was first seen.\"      How they faredWhen the police super-recognizers were compared to facial examiners\u2014people whose job may involve verifying identity such as immigration officers or expert forensic witnesses in court\u2014the police officers performed as well or better in the tasks the researchers set them, which is substantially better than the general population.But Prof. White emphasized that even super-recognizers do not have 100% perfect recall of faces. Despite the common assertion that they \"never forget a face,\" no person sitting the UNSW Face Test has ever achieved full marks.\"Our research shows that selecting super-recognizers for applied face identification tasks can provide substantial benefits to accuracy, potentially reducing face ID errors by more than 20%.\"But what our research also reveals is that super-recognizers do make errors, even in tasks that do not involve memory. Even when comparing two high-quality images side-by-side\u2014for example, a person's current passport photo to a selfie image taken on a camera phone\u2014super-recognizer made 20% errors on average and even the very best super-recognizer made 8% errors.\"These tests were very challenging because images of the same face used in matching test items were taken at different times, often years apart, and in different environmental conditions and using different cameras,\" Prof. White says, adding that these complicating factors are exactly what police and other face examiners experience on a daily basis.Interestingly, when participants were asked to recall the context from where a particular face was first committed to memory, police super-recognizers were no better than average university students. This suggests there are strict limits to super-recognizers' abilities.\"This shows an important boundary to their superior ability. While they may be better at recognizing faces they have been shown in a learning phase, they appeared to be no better than the average person at remembering the surrounding visual context that the face had been shown in.\"What about artificial intelligence?It is well known from past research from Prof. White's Forensic Psychology Lab at UNSW that people regularly make mistakes in professional environments where identification is a requirement. Given that the most recent research shows that even super-recognizers have limits, does that mean artificial intelligence (AI) will soon assume all face recognition work?Prof. White says while AI is being used increasingly for face recognition, it is still not at the stage where its face recognition abilities are superior to those of humans.\"Police already use this technology in Australia. When the police are using it for investigation they've often got a poor quality image and then use that image to search a massive database\u2014all AI can do is throw up the most faces that are similar. It can't say definitively that is the same person or not, so this is why we still need humans to make the final call.\"Facing forwardProf. White is hoping that the latest research can be used by other police and security forces in Australia and globally to unearth the super-recognizers in its ranks, while importantly, highlighting the limits to their special ability.\"Face misidentifications can have potentially profound implications, especially when used in criminal investigations and trials,\" he says.\"Here we have shown that using super-recognizers reduces face identification errors, but our other recent work has shown that optimal accuracy can only be achieved by synthesizing face ID decisions made by AI, super-recognizers and forensic experts. In future, we hope to develop procedures for drawing on these different types of face ID evidence to reduce errors and bias in face ID decisions.\" More information:James D.

  "text": "Early humans in Europe were making and controlling fire at least 50,000 years earlier than previously thought, researchers at Heriot-Watt University in Scotland have found.          In a paper published in the journal, Scientific Reports, the scientists set out evidence that our ancestors in Europe were using fires for activities like cooking, heating and defense at least 250,000 years ago. Previous evidence had suggested humans were managing fire in Europe much later than this, around 200,000 years ago.Using forensic chemical methods to identify molecules of incomplete burning, the research team at Heriot-Watt's School of Energy, Geoscience, Infrastructure and Society detected fire at Valdocarros II, an archaeological site near Madrid in Spain.Dr. Clayton Magill, an Assistant Professor at Heriot-Watt who specializes in using geochemistry to reconstruct ancient environmental conditions, led the project in collaboration with Spanish archaeologists Susana Rubio\u2011Jara and Joaqu\u00edn Panera of Complutense University of Madrid. Geochemistry involves studying the chemical composition of the earth and its rocks and minerals.Dr. Magill said, \"We have found definitive evidence of things being burnt and those remains are organized into a pattern, suggesting it's humans who are making and controlling the fire. Either they were using the fire to cook or to defend themselves. The spatial patterning in the fire tells us that they were encircling something, like a home or sleeping area, a living room or kitchen, or an enclosure for animals.\"The chemical profiles of the charred remains also suggest our human ancestors chose certain types of firewood for its burning properties, such as heat and lack of smoke.The findings are \"very exciting\" and close a gap in our understanding of human-controlled fire and human development, Dr. Magill said.\"This is important because our species is defined by our use of fire,\" Dr. Magill said. \"Being able to cook food to feed our big brains is one of the things that made us so successful in an evolutionary sense. Fire also brings protection and fosters communication and family connection. And we now have definitive, incontrovertible evidence that humans were starting and stopping fires in Europe about 50,000 years earlier than we suspected.\"Chemical analysis is a more reliable way of confirming fire than analyzing remains in archaeological hearths, which can be eroded by weather conditions or the extraction process, Dr. Magill added.In the next phase of the project, the research team will study stone tools found near fire hearths to identify whether these were used in particular ways around the making and controlling of fire\u2014for example, to cut meat or pulverize plants.\"We want to understand whether the selective or specialized use of tools is something that should go at least theoretically hand-in-hand with fire control,\" said Dr. Magill, who is also Assistant Professor in Geoenergy at the Lyell Centre for Earth and Marine Sciences, one of Heriot-Watt's Global Research Institutes.Archaeologists Susana Rubio\u2011Jara and Joaqu\u00edn Panera gave the Heriot-Watt team access to highly regulated and rare samples from the Valdocarros II site, and worked with former Heriot-Watt Ph.D. student Lavinia M. Stancampiano to collect samples with forensic-level cleanliness and attention to detail.The other researchers in the project are David Uribelarrea del Val and Alfredo P\u00e9rez Gonz\u00e1lez, also from Complutense University of Madrid.Globally, the oldest clear evidence of human-controlled fire is in East Africa about 1.5 million years ago and in Israel about 790,000 years ago. In Europe, countries including Hungary, France and Germany have been linked with previous evidence of fire.

  "text": "The flight from urban areas that took place during the first year of the pandemic either reversed or slowed in its second year, as last year metropolitan areas in Texas and Florida boomed and declines in New York and Los Angeles were halved, according to new estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau.          During the first full year of the pandemic in 2021, more than half of the 20 largest U.S. metro areas lost residents, and all U.S. metro areas grew by just 0.1%, as fear of the virus sent residents fleeing the most densely-populated urban areas and the popularity of remote work allowed people to live far from their workplaces.By comparison, only eight of the 20 largest metro areas decreased in 2022, and the growth rate for all U.S. metros was 0.4%. Among the largest U.S. metros that had gains in 2022 after experiencing losses in 2021 were Washington, Miami-Fort Lauderdale, Seattle, Minneapolis and San Diego, according to 2022 population estimates released Thursday by the Census Bureau.The Dallas-Fort Worth area grew the most among U.S. metros, jumping by six-digit figures for a second consecutive year, as it gained another 170,000 residents last year. Metro Dallas-Fort Worth's 7.9 million residents made it the nation's fourth-largest metropolitan area, behind only New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, all of which lost population last year but with much smaller losses compared to the first year of the pandemic.Other metropolitan areas which saw the largest growth in number were Houston, adding more than 124,000 residents; Atlanta, with almost 79,000 new residents; Phoenix, with an additional nearly 73,000 people; and Orlando, Florida, adding almost 65,000 new residents.Metro Phoenix also surpassed the 5 million-person threshold for the first time last year.There were other signs that 2021's pandemic-related migration changed a year later.Boise Idaho and Provo, Utah\u2014two metros that were popular destinations in 2021 for residents fleeing the West Coast's most populous cities\u2014dropped out of the top 20 in population growth in 2022.By that same token, smaller communities known as micropolitan statistical areas grew by 0.1% last year compared to 0.2% in 2021.Metropolitan statistical areas consist of one or more counties containing a central city with a population of at least 50,000 residents that together have a high degree of economic and social connections. The central city in a micropolitan statistical area must have at least 10,000 residents but no more than 50,000 residents.Population change is driven by migration, including within U.S. borders as people move around and internationally as people arrive from abroad. It is also dependent on a community's number of births and deaths. Thursday's data release doesn't show the reasons behind population changes, but similar data at the county level released in March showed it was mostly driven by international migration.Individually, cities that make up the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area were among those that grew the most in the U.S. last year. With 19,100 new residents, the city of Forth Worth led the nation, followed by the city Phoenix with more than 19,000 additional residents and the city of San Antonio, Texas, with more than 18,800 residents gained.Two other cities in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area\u2014Dallas and Frisco\u2014also were among those whose numbers most dramatically spiked, jumping respectively by 8,800 residents and 8,500 residents. These new residents were lured by a strong economy, mild winters and good schools.The Villages, Florida, a relatively new retirement community northwest of Orlando, was the fastest-growing U.S. metro area between 2021 and 2022, increasing by 7.5%.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

  "answer_squad": " Accelerated Christian Education",
  "text": "One of the world's largest fundamentalist Christian education groups is teaching its students climate change denial as fact, and still presents the theory of evolution as an \"absurd and discredited\" conspiracy theory, finds a report by University College London (UCL) researchers.          Accelerated Christian Education (ACE) is one of the world's biggest providers of creationist science materials, consisting of reading programs and a core curriculum, for thousands of affiliated schools worldwide, including dozens across the UK and Europe.There are currently 11 schools in England and Northern Ireland officially affiliated with ACE, although experts expect there to be many more as the schools are notoriously isolationist, conservative and don't advertise themselves widely.In the report, published in Cultural Studies of Science Education, researchers found that its latest edition, which has been released to year groups from Key stages 1 to 3 gradually over the last few years, now claims to show \"evidence\" that human-caused climate change is not real, and still presents evolution as a conspiracy theory. This is despite claims by the curriculum's developers that its materials allow students to make up their own minds about evolution.The addition of climate change denial as a proof point for creationism follows on from previous editions that claimed the existence of a \"vapor canopy\" that surrounded Earth until it burst, causing Noah's flood. Although the most recent edition doesn't include this and the claim has largely been dropped by the group, space within the material previously given over to the theory now covers climate change, specifically to deny a human link between rising temperatures and to reassure students of God's plan in preparing a new heaven and Earth with a better climate.Lead author Dr. Jenna Scaramanga (IOE, UCL's Faculty of Education and Society) said, \"It is worrying that the most recent edition of this material not only still promotes creationism as a valid scientific theory, but adds climate change denial to its increasingly anti-science agenda. Students studying at ACE schools or using ACE materials move into mainstream further or higher education ill-equipped to study advanced science or to make informed judgments about scientific discoveries.      \"Presenting creationism and evolution in this way is a conspiracy theory, as the providers and teachers argue that mainstream scientists are colluding to promote false ideas. Teaching children in this way means they are more likely to easily accept and believe other conspiracy theories.\"The authors found through analyzing the third and fourth editions of the material that younger primary/elementary school children are not exposed to any ideas contrary to ACE's literal interpretation of the Bible until Year 9, or the eighth grade in the US, around age 13. Researchers say this is contrary to Ofsted education guidance, which stipulates that primary school children must be exposed to a broad and balanced science education.The fourth edition of ACE's material was first released for the youngest age group, five- to six-year-olds, in 2009, with subsequent grades following gradually. Material for 12- to 14-year-olds was released in 2016 and 2020 respectively.Overall, the only substantial difference between the third and fourth editions were two new arguments, which have both been widely discredited by scientists. One is the claim of tiny amounts of polonium found in granite rocks as evidence that Earth formed instantaneously, while the other is that traces of blood vessels and soft tissue found in some dinosaur fossils prove they must have died comparatively recently, suggesting that Earth is a young planet.ACE has previously been criticized for relying on rote memorization over other learning styles and presenting misleading or distorted information. The curriculum delivered within ACE schools regularly includes creationism within non-science lessons and depicts those who believe in evolution as making an immoral choice.The material has also been previously criticized for supporting white supremacism and defending South African apartheid. In its first 20 years, ACE was involved in over 150 lawsuits, mostly relating to accreditation, with subsequent court cases. The company believes that Christian schools should not be regulated, and schools using its curriculum have defended this belief through litigation.Dr. Scaramanga added, \"Questions need to be asked about how these schools and those which rely heavily on ACE publications pass Ofsted checks when their curricula and materials clearly fail to provide a broad and balanced science education and fail in the requirement of teaching respect for different beliefs.\" More information:Jenna Scaramanga, Michael Reiss, Evolutionary stasis: creationism, evolution and climate change in the Accelerated Christian Education curriculum, Cultural Studies of Science Education (2023).Provided byUniversity College LondonCitation:Accelerated Christian Education textbooks used in UK schools deny human-caused climate change (2023, May 17)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-christian-textbooks-uk-schools-deny.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "\"Will you be paying with cash or card?\"          It's a question that's been asked of consumers for decades. And despite the increasing popularity of digital payment methods, cash and card remain the most popular choices worldwide. In 2021, 65 percent of all point-of-sale transactions globally were made using cash or card, according to Fidelity National Information Services.Past research shows that 90 percent of households use multiple payment methods, but new research from the University of Notre Dame takes a first look into how consumers choose between them. The study finds that the justifiability of a purchase affects how consumers choose to pay.\"Purchase Justifiability Drives Payment Choice: Consumers Pay With Card To Remember And Cash To Forget\" is forthcoming in the Journal of the Association for Consumer Research from Christopher Bechler, assistant professor of marketing in Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business, along with Szu-chi Huang from Stanford University and Joshua Morris, data science manager for Nike.\"When a purchase is difficult to justify\u2014like buying an overpriced bottle of water at the airport, cigarettes or candy\u2014consumers pay with less-trackable methods, like cash, so they can eliminate the paper or electronic trail and 'forget' this guilty purchase,\" said Bechler, who specializes in consumer behavior and social psychology with an emphasis on attitudes, persuasion and financial decision-making. \"When a purchase is easy to justify, consumers have no problem paying with trackable methods like credit cards that create paper or electronic trails.\"Credit: University of Notre DameDespite the vast amount of research on financial decision-making in behavioral economics, consumer behavior and social psychology, this is the first study to take an in-depth look at how consumers choose to pay.The team analyzed real transaction data from 118,042 purchases and manipulated the justifiability of purchases consumers imagined making in six experiments on more than 5,000 individuals. They hoped to capture the causal effect of hard-to-justify purchases on consumers' intentions to use cash vs. a credit or debit card.      \"I think a lot of consumers\u2014particularly those who diligently track their card expenses\u2014recognize that they use cash so they don't have to think about certain purchases again,\" Bechler said. \"In fact, this strategy of using cash to hide purchases from ourselves if we feel bad about them is something my co-authors and I admitted to doing ourselves.\"The findings show merchants it's a good idea to be strategic with the types of payment methods they allow.\"A doughnut shop could benefit from letting its customers pay with cash because they may want to forget their unhealthy purchase,\" Bechler said. \"A salad shop might not see the same benefit.\"And as the world turns to cryptocurrencies and new payment methods, the study underscores implications for both merchants and financial institutions designing payment methods of the future. Bechler said understanding the factors that affect how consumers choose to pay could be important for predicting which new methods will garner widespread adoption.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards ChatGPT?",
  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the user-friendly chatbot?",
  "answer_squad": " ChatGPT",
  "text": "With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), several aspects of our lives have become more efficient and easier to navigate. One of the latest AI-based technologies is a user-friendly chatbot\u2014ChatGPT, which is growing in popularity owing to its many applications, including in the field of education.          ChatGPT uses algorithms to generate text similar to that generated by a human, within seconds. With its correct and responsible use, it could be used to answer questions, source information, write essays, summarize documents, compose code, and much more. By extension, ChatGPT could transform education drastically by creating virtual tutors, providing personalized learning, and enhancing AI literacy among teachers and students.However, ChatGPT or any AI-based technology capable of creating content in education, must be approached with caution.Recently, a research team including Dr. Weipeng Yang, Assistant Professor at the Education University of Hong Kong, and Ms. Jiahong Su from the University of Hong Kong, proposed a theoretical framework known as 'IDEE' for guiding AI use in education (also referred to as 'educative AI').In their study, which was published in the ECNU Review of Education on April 19, 2023, the team also identified the benefits and challenges of using educative AI and provided recommendations for future educative AI research and policies. Dr. Yang remarks, \"We developed the IDEE framework to guide the integration of generative artificial intelligence into educational activities. Our practical examples show how educative Al can be used to improve teaching and learning processes.\"The IDEE framework for educative AI includes a four-step process. 'I' stands for identifying the desired outcomes and objectives, 'D' stands for determining the appropriate level of automation, the first 'E' stands for ensuring that ethical considerations are met, and the second 'E' stands for evaluating the effectiveness of the application. For instance, the researchers tested the IDEE framework for using ChatGPT as a virtual coach for early childhood teachers by providing quick responses to teachers during classroom observations.They found that ChatGPT can provide a more personalized and interactive learning experience for students that is tailored to their individual needs. It can also improve teaching models, assessment systems, and make education more enjoyable. Furthermore, it can help save teachers' time and energy by providing answers to students' questions, encourage teachers to reflect more on educational content, and provide useful teaching suggestions.      Notably, mainstream ChatGPT use for educational purposes raises many concerns including issues of costs, ethics, and safety. Real-world applications of ChatGPT require significant investments with respect to hardware, software, maintenance, and support, which may not be affordable for many educational institutions.In fact, the unregulated use of ChatGPT could lead students to access inaccurate or dangerous information. ChatGPT could also be wrongfully used to collect sensitive information about students without their knowledge or consent. Unfortunately, AI models are only as good as the data used to train them. Hence, low quality data that is not representative of all student cohorts can generate erroneous, unreliable, and discriminatory AI responses.Since ChatGPT and other educative AI are still emerging technologies, understanding their effectiveness in education warrants further research. Accordingly, the researchers offer recommendations for future opportunities related to educative AI. There is a dire need for more contextual research on using AI under different educational settings. Secondly, there should be an in-depth exploration of the ethical and social implications of educative AI.Thirdly, the integration of AI into educational practices must involve teachers who are regularly trained in the use of generative AI. Finally, there should be polices and regulations for monitoring the use of educative AI to ensure responsible, unbiased, and equal technological access for all students.Dr. Yang says, \"While we acknowledge the benefits of educative AI, we also recognize the limitations and existing gaps in this field. We hope that our framework can stimulate more interest and empirical research to fill these gaps and promote widespread application of Al in education.\" More information:Jiahong Su (\u82cf\u5609\u7ea2) et al, Unlocking the Power of ChatGPT: A Framework for Applying Generative AI in Education, ECNU Review of Education (2023).

  "text": "When Christopher Columbus arrived at the present-day US Virgin Islands on his second voyage across the Atlantic in 1493, the islands were already inhabited\u2014but how and when the islands of St. Croix, St. John, and St. Thomas were originally populated remains uncertain.          Now, a research team present a chemically-based answer to the puzzle. An international research team from the United States, Argentina, the United Kingdom, and Denmark got permission to conduct the first thermoluminescence dating of archaeologically excavated pottery shards from the islands.These results can now be compared with archaeologists' previous datings, which were based on stylistic analysis, site location, and radiocarbon dating. The results have been published in the journal Heritage Science.\"For the first time, we have conducted a thermoluminescence dating of the pottery shards left behind by the islands' former inhabitants. This provides a more accurate dating of the culture that prevailed on the islands because pottery shards are the most important archaeological artifact group in this warm tropical climate,\" says Kaare Lund Rasmussen, a professor at the Department of Physics, Chemistry, and Pharmacy, who led the chemical analyses.He is an expert in archaeometry, which involves conducting chemical analyses of archaeological and historical objects. He has analyzed high-profile artifacts such as the tomb of Renaissance astronomer Tycho Brahe, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the coffin of King Canute the Holy, and the skeletons of Jesus' apostles.The pottery shards were made available by the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, which granted the researchers permission to take samples from the ceramic pieces brought to the museum in 1924 from the former Danish colonies in the West Indies. The samples consist of 128 pottery shards from seven different locations on St. John, St. Thomas, and St. Croix.\"These new datings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of when the islands were inhabited and, most importantly, how many different ethnic groups lived on the islands or engaged in trade with each other at the same time,\" says Kaare Lund Rasmussen.Who these early residents were, researchers don't know much about. Although several archaeological investigations have been conducted on the islands, not many artifacts have been found apart from pottery shards that can contribute to forming a picture of the people who inhabited and settled on the islands.                Selection of the 128 pottery shards, analyzed by Professor Kaare Lund Rasmussen, University of Southern Denmark. Credit: Kaare Lund Rasmussen/University of Southern Denmark             The new datings challenge the prevailing theory about the early inhabitants of the islands. According to the widely accepted theory proposed by Professor Irwin Rouse from Yale University in 1960, immigrants arrived in three successive waves from the south, originating from the mouth of the Orinoco River in Venezuela.This theory is plausible and intuitively understandable for several reasons: One can see from one island to the next in the chain (at least in good weather). Furthermore, the almost always prevailing southeasterly wind makes the journey northwest relatively easy.However, Lund Rasmussen's and co-workers' thermoluminescence datings have revealed that several different styles coexisted on the islands at the same time.\"Our data suggests that multiple cultures were present in the same location simultaneously or at least in close proximity to each other, enabling them to engage in trade. This contradicts to some extent the theory of three major waves of immigration from south to north. It appears to be more of a multitude of different styles that prevailed simultaneously at almost all locations,\" says Lund Rasmussen.As an example, he mentions that the styles of Ostiones, Monserrate, Santa Elena, La Hueca, and Cuevas, each displaying their own distinctive pottery decoration, have been found at various locations on the three islands within a timeframe that researchers date from 600 to 1200 AD.\"This indicates that these five different ethnic groups may have inhabited these places during the mentioned period. Perhaps not continuously\u2014they may have come and gone, only to return again. But they were certainly within trading distance of each other. It seems that the travels went in multiple directions, both north and south,\" explains Kaare Lund Rasmussen.Until now, datings of archaeological findings on the U.S. Virgin Islands were based on radiocarbon dating of the surrounding materials found together with the pottery shards. For example, radiocarbon dating has been performed on seashells found alongside the pottery shards. The ages of the pottery shards were also estimated based on their decoration and production techniques, placing them in Rouse's scheme of immigration waves.\"Radiocarbon datings of remains found near pottery shards can generally be helpful for archaeologists. However, the problem in the Virgin Islands is that there are rarely well-defined layers where the overlying layer is clearly and distinctly younger than the underlying layer. In fact, only one site on the islands has a truly good stratigraphy, namely Cinnamon Bay on St. John. The situation at most other locations more closely resembles kitchen middens,\" says Kaare Lund Rasmussen.Currently, the research team is investigating whether the chemical composition of the clay can provide information about where the different pottery vessels were made, potentially determining whether a pottery vessel was locally produced or brought by canoe from another island.

  "text": "By reflecting every now and then on what they want to achieve in their job, teachers can boost their students' motivation. As well as their own.          The less teachers believe that it's necessary for students to have an innate talent in order to perform well, the more they will boost motivation and success in the classroom.An international research team led by Professor Anke Heyder from the Department of Psychology at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, has identified a simple, compact and effective way to strengthen this belief: they invited student teachers to reflect and briefly write down the mission they associate with the teaching profession and how they personally would like to make a positive impact on the lives of the students they teach.A week later, participants remained strongly convinced that all children are capable of learning and succeeding in school, regardless of their individual abilities. The researchers published their report in the journal Learning and Instruction.All children can thriveWhether or not students enjoy school and perform well in the classroom depends very much on the teachers, whose fundamental beliefs can be transferred to the learners. \"The important factor is whether a teacher is convinced that all children can thrive and learn,\" explains Anke Heyder. In psychology, this belief is referred to as the growth mindset.\"The belief that a talent or fixed aptitude is necessary for learning success, that students will fail otherwise, is more likely a hindrance.\" This so-called fixed mindset tends to reduce motivation, especially among students with poorer performance.Even though these relations have been identified in many studies, a compact intervention designed to reinforce the growth mindset among teachers hasn't been introduced as yet. \"Our intervention is new, and it is both short and subtle,\" points out Anke Heyder. \"At its core is a brief reflection on your personal mission: why am I a teacher? How do I want to make a difference to my students through what I do?\"Survey on teacher beliefsTo test the intervention, the researchers recruited a total of 576 student teachers for their study. The participants were divided into groups. In the intervention group, they were asked to briefly reflect on and write down their mission, before completing a survey on their beliefs. In the control groups, they didn't reflect on their mission but on a different question, and then answered the questionnaire.\"We showed that the beliefs of those participants who focused on their mission was significantly more inclined towards a growth mindset than that of the control group,\" explains Anke Heyder. This result was unrelated to the subject the student teachers were pursuing. A survey one week later yielded the same result.\"This indicates that the effect does last\u2014at least for a while,\" says Heyder. Follow-up research will be necessary to establish whether the effect is permanent. \"I can only advise teachers, but also university lecturers and business leaders, to reflect on their own mission every now and then,\" concludes the researcher. \"Not only does this benefit the people for whom you are responsible, but there's also evidence that it boosts your own motivation and job satisfaction.\" More information:Anke Heyder et al, Reflecting on their mission increases preservice teachers' growth mindsets, Learning and Instruction (2023).

  "text": "When a child behaves in an unwanted manner, changing their behavior often becomes a focus. Research, however, suggests that influencing the behavior of adults who interact with the child would be more effective.          Researchers at the University of Eastern Finland and the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 conducted an 18-month follow-up of 18 Finnish early childhood education and care (ECEC) centers that were piloting positive behavior intervention and support (PBIS), which takes a research-based approach to creating an operational culture that supports the behavior of all children.The PBIS approach sought to clarify the situation-specific behavioral expectations of the ECEC centers and provided training and coaching on how to comply with them. Children's appropriate social behavior was acknowledged as systematically as possible through positive feedback, and efforts were made to pay less attention to possible failures.One ECEC center, for example, managed to make its corridors less noisy and crowded by teaching children about personal space when moving in the corridors. Professionals working in the ECEC center, on the other hand, were committed to acknowledging children's success in considering personal space, and they gave plenty of individual and positive feedback whenever children moved about in the corridors in an orderly manner.In some ECEC centers, children's success with social behavior was also reinforced with tokens. Collecting these tokens gave cause to collective celebration of achievement, or otherwise served as a pleasant collective activity.Change takes timeAccording to Senior Researcher Noora Heiskanen of the University of Eastern Finland, the study showed that even when successful, development was a balancing act between many challenges.\"In order to support children in their behavioral challenges in the right way, the entire environment of ECEC, and the ECEC community, must commit to the change of pedagogical practices and understand its significance.\"The theoretical implementation of the new approach and its integration into the existing practices of ECEC centers require time, collaboration, and competence.\"It is not always easy for ECEC professionals to accept change, and enough time should be given to the adoption of the new approach. The ECEC centers piloting the PBIS approach succeeded in creating a uniform way of teaching social behavior to children, specifically through the participation of the whole community, as well as through research-based, guided development.\"According to University Lecturer Anne Karhu of the University of Eastern Finland, the findings give good tools for a wider development of practices in ECEC.\"Review and development of the common practices plays a key role. The PBIS approach can be used to build an ECEC community that is welcoming to all children and that has research-based means to address possible challenges in children's behavior.\"According to Karhu, behavioral support should be integrated into all activities. In addition, social behavior should be taught in a preventive manner, while also ensuring enhanced support for those who need it.\"The PBIS approach also provides a good basis for providing more advanced and more intensive behavioral support for children who need it.\"The joint research project between the University of Eastern Finland and the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 will continue to develop and study these enhanced and individual forms of behavioral support. Highlighting the importance of developing community-level practices, the findings are very topical in view of the discussion related to inclusion in ECEC, and in the educational system at large.The study is published in the European Journal of Special Needs Education.

  "text": "With ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence systems making waves, some people are turning to AI for financial planning, according to one West Virginia University researcher.          The AI-powered financial planning service \"robo-advising,\" or automated investing, is relatively new but rapidly expanding, and many large U.S. investment firms now offer robo-advising accounts.Pawan Jain, assistant professor of finance at the WVU John Chambers College of Business and Economics, is an expert on technology-forward financial tools such as blockchain and high-frequency trading and co-author of a demographic analysis of a robo-advising firm's customer base that appeared in the Financial Review.Jain explains what robo-advising is, how it works, who's likely to use it and some potential benefits and risks of automated investing.\"In robo-advising, algorithms monitor portfolios and evaluate clients' financial conditions, risk tolerances and objectives to provide investment recommendations with little to no human help, typically via a diversified mix of low-cost, exchange-traded funds or index funds,\" he explains.\"Robo-advising could disrupt traditional wealth management by enabling investment of smaller sums at lower costs. From a user perspective, robo-advising typically involves creating an account on the robo-adviser's website or phone app, answering a series of questions about your investment goals and risk tolerance, and linking the bank account to fund the investment account. Then the robo-adviser or AI analyzes the information collected from the client\u2014risk tolerance, investment goals, time horizon\u2014and creates a personalized investment portfolio for the client. Robo-advisers share information in real-time and can be accessed online 24/7.\"The portfolio is typically composed of a diversified mix of low-cost ETFs or index funds that align with the investor's goals and risk tolerance. Clients can view their portfolios, track investments and make account changes such as adding or withdrawing funds through a web-based or mobile platform. The robo-adviser's algorithm monitors the portfolio and adjusts as needed to keep the portfolio aligned with the investor's goals, usually through rebalancing. Some robo-advisers offer additional services such as personalized financial planning and tax optimization.\"The minimum dollar amount required to start an investment account that comes with personalized financial advice from an AI is much smaller than the investment that's required to get tailored financial planning support from a human, so robo-advising lowers the economic barrier to guided participation in the stock market. Robo-advising enables people who could not afford traditional investment services to start saving and investing based on advice and portfolio management that is automated, but tailored to individual situations, preferences and goals.\"Robo-advising has the potential to fuel economic growth on a macro scale by engaging new lower-income demographics in\u2014first of all\u2014saving for retirement, and secondly, doing so through investments in stocks, bonds and other assets.\"In conclusion, says Jain, \"One downside is that robo-advising portfolios generate significantly lower returns as compared to the market index, so a portfolio managed by AI is unlikely to perform as well as one managed by a professional human adviser. And robo-advising is not for everyone\u2014someone who prefers personal interaction and emotional support should choose a human adviser to guide them through the investment process. Finally, as with any centralized technology company, there is always a cybersecurity risk.\" More information:Vishaal Baulkaran et al, Who uses robo\u2010advising and how?, Financial Review (2022).

  "text": "What does artificial intelligence offer that goes beyond traditional statistical models, such as regression analysis, to investigate the behavior of households, in particular the factors that cause the separation of couples and dissolution of the conjugal bond?          With Bruno Arpino (University of Florence) and Marco Le Moglie (Catholic University of Milan) we have analyzed data for over 2,000 German married or cohabiting couples, who were followed for a dozen years on average by the annual GSOEP survey (German Socio-Economic Panel), with more than 900 ending in separation.By adopting a machine learning approach (specifically, Random Survival Forests) the procedure found on its own the relationship between the various factors contained in the database. In this case it considered more than 40 factors, from age to education level, from health to psychology traits: the mass of raw data was fed to ML, without making precise hypotheses, but simply indicating as event of interest the break-up of the union, and the algorithm indicated the influence of each factor contained in the data. The variables that pose the greatest threat to the stability of a union have been identified with an accuracy of 70% (a predictive ability that outperforms the 50% achieved by traditional regression methods).Not only was ML able to discover the factors behind the breakup of couples, but it was also able to use this knowledge to predict the end of a union before it happens. This is also because, instead of submitting all the data available to an ad hoc algorithm, half were used to instruct the algorithm itself and the validity of the results was verified with the other half of the dataset.The results of the analysis are very interesting, above all because the ML methodology is able to weigh the relative importance of various factors in causing the breakup. Factors that had been particularly influential in previous studies have instead lost their relevance here, like unemployment, and the partner's high level of education and income.The four major risk factors, that emerged from the study are in descending order: personal satisfaction, the woman's quantity of paid work, some personality factors and age.The strongest predictor of separation is personal satisfaction: if both partners are dissatisfied, obviously the couple won't last. Less obvious is that a strong drop in conjugal stability emerges when the woman is very satisfied with the union but the man much less so, while the reverse effect is less evident. If the woman works many hours outside the home, the risk of separation or divorce is higher, even when the man is more involved in domestic chores (but this result is nothing new and according to the existing literature it depends on the greater agency and independence of working women.      As for personality traits, high extraversion in men (classically linked to a higher infidelity) and low openness in women, less adaptable to the changes brought about by cohabitation, are the traits that more strongly associated with the end of a couple. Also a low level of conscientiousness in both partners (understood as organizational capacity in daily life, and therefore\u2014if low\u2014as disorder and inability to respect commitments) does not help to stay together. But also a too high or too low level of neuroticism can be a problem. This result can be interpreted as the fact that suffering from excessive anxiety, jealousy, guilt, worry or anger clearly complicates the relationship.This is true above all for women, but, on the other hand, those who don't feel this type of emotion could lead their partners to read that personality trait as lack of interest (men, in this case). However, no pairing of personalities was determined that is more strongly associated with the breakup of the relationship. Finally, considering age, very young couples tend to be more unstable, but for women stability in relationships intensifies after the age of 40, while this is not the case for men.ML analysis is not without limitations. In this case a major one is that it refers only to Germany and also has few details on the psychological aspects of the two partners. However, from a methodological point of view, the study demonstrates the great potential of ML techniques in demographic and sociological research in general, highlighting their ability to monitor and analyze a large number of predictive factors, to automatically find linear or non-linear relations, additive or non-additive relations between these factors and the outcome of interest, with greater precision and more robustness of estimates against collinearity than commonly used methods.

  "text": "While previous research has focused primarily on anti-Black racism in predominantly white spaces, a study led by DeMarcus Jenkins, assistant professor of education (educational leadership) in the Penn State College of Education, examined the educational experiences of Black students in a predominantly Latino high school. The students' sense of unbelonging and feeling that their experiences are unimaginable to non-Black people may help to inform ways to address racism in schools, according to Jenkins.          Jenkins' research, published in Equity and Excellence in Education, revealed two major themes: (1) Black students felt a sense of unbelonging, and (2) they perceived their Blackness as unimaginable to non-Black people. \"There's been scholarship that has looked at social/racial relations between Black and brown (Latino) communities,\" added Jenkins. \"I wanted to draw from that body of scholarship to think about how Black students are experiencing their learning environments.\"In his paper, Jenkins cited prior research on race and education that, he wrote, demonstrates that Black bodies are seen as \"undesirable and require exclusion or neglect.\" He also drew on scholarship that shows that educators disproportionately discipline Black students via school suspensions or disciplinary referrals.Jenkins began his study by conducting interviews and focus groups with Black students at a predominantly Latino high school in Arizona. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Arizona is only 5.4% Black or African American while the Hispanic or Latino category comprises 32.3% of the 7.276 million state population. As the Latino population continues to rise in Arizona and across the country, Jenkins said, an increasing number of Black students will be attending predominantly Latino schools. The focus of his research, he said, is \"how Black students embody anti-Blackness, how does it manifest toward them, and how does that shape how they navigate school?\"To conduct his research, Jenkins observed several English classes and conducted focus groups in which he interviewed students about their experiences. The students' perception of space, he said, was interconnected with feelings of discomfort and unbelonging.More than half of the participants described their feelings in high school as being \"unimaginable.\" During the interviews, students also expressed feelings of anger, anxiety or embarrassment rendered by adults who held authority over particular spaces such as the library and nurse's office. Several students articulated that they often felt like they did not have a place at the school outside of athletic clubs and extracurricular activities.Jenkins' program of research considers the intersections of race, space and policy. In his current study, he pays particular attention to the body as a spatial landscape via visceral geography. Visceral geographies \"regard the body as a useful geographical site of inquiry, interrogating how bodies feel internally\u2014moods, sensations, emotions, physical states of being\u2014in relation to the surrounding material and discursive environment.\"\"As an emerging field of study, Black geographies consider how Blackness is experienced not only socially, politically, and economically but also spatially,\" Jenkins wrote in his paper. \"I explore how Black students experienced anti-Black racism and how they embodied these racial moments.\"To understand how the students embodied racial moments at school, Jenkins used \"Black Critical Theory\"\u2014an educational research approach to understanding the detailed and specific ways Black people live in and experience anti-Black spaces and anti-Black racism in schools.\"Anti-Blackness constructs Black people as inherently problematic and whose existence remains outside of humanity,\" explained Jenkins.As a practical intervention, Jenkins wrote in the paper, educators could consider the school's physical spaces and how they impact Black students' feelings of belonging. When educators can evaluate and mediate the forces that trigger negative visceral responses, said Jenkins, \"then the ability of researchers to examine the conditions necessary to promote more positive schooling experiences for Black youth increases.\"\"Educators can open spaces for students to articulate their feelings and make intentional efforts to transform their classrooms so that all students feel a sense of belongingness,\" he said.

  "text": "People's willingness to believe in climate change varies greatly, as does their willingness to engage in pro-environmental behavior, such as energy conservation. We tried to understand the psychological factors behind these differences in our recent study.          The problem of climate change presents a social dilemma, one which sets up a conflict between cooperating for the common good and acting in one's individual self-interest.For instance, if all fishermen abide by fishing quotas, it is good for everyone. If one fisherman exceeds the quota while everyone else abides by it, then that individual is better off at the expense of others.But if it is individually rational for one to exceed the quota, then it is rational for everyone to do so, resulting in the rapid depletion of fish stock.Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is costly. If other countries reduce while one does not, the latter is better off at the expense of the others. But if everyone acts to maximize their own self-interest we get greater pollution and global warming.Willingness to cooperateOne psychological mechanism that could explain variation in climate change beliefs and pro-environmental behavior is a general willingness to cooperate in responding to social dilemmas.Our study uses a set of behavioral economic games to present social dilemma problems to almost 900 New Zealanders. These games offer monetary rewards, and players must choose between prioritizing the common good among a small group of strangers or maximizing personal gain.The choice is simple: cooperate in the group interest, which makes one vulnerable to free-riding by others, or maximize one's self-interest. Free-riding pays more if others cooperate, but if everyone does it then cooperation unravels and everyone is worse off.Using such micro-scale social dilemma games, we found a general psychological preference for cooperation that we refer to as the \"cooperative phenotype\" (phenotype being all observable characteristics of an organism). These were people who routinely cooperate with strangers even if that means sacrificing money.We then show that those who behaved cooperatively in such small-scale decision tasks were more likely to report engaging in pro-environmental behavior than individuals who cooperated less.We also found a positive relationship between cooperation in these games and climate change beliefs. Individuals who cooperated more were more likely to believe in human-caused climate change than individuals who cooperated less.      Linking cooperation and actionOur findings are striking because when people played our games we made no mention of any real-world scenario. The only connection between the games and climate change or the environment was the fact they all involve an opportunity to cooperate in a social dilemma. What, then, might explain the connection?It is possible that cooperators in our games were also more willing to make sacrifices for the environment and come to believe in climate change as a possible justification for their actions. Here the action drives the beliefs.Alternatively, it may be that those who are more cooperative find belief in climate change more palatable and as a result come to take pro-environmental action. Here the beliefs drive the subsequent actions.We found at least some evidence for the second scenario\u2014those who are more cooperative tended to believe in the facts of climate change and were willing to take action.Linking climate change to a general drive to cooperate makes us optimistic. Prior work using games very similar to those we used showed people were more likely to cooperate if they believed their peers would do so too. This emphasizes the importance of speaking across ideological divides, rather than confining our interactions to those who think like us.Giving to big and small causesIntriguingly, we also found a larger proportion of the cooperative types tended to be Green Party supporters rather than National or Labour. This suggests the broad pro-social tendency tapped by the cooperative phenotype may also explain some of the variance in political party support.This may also be an important predictor of climate change beliefs and pro-environmental behavior.Crucially, this doesn't mean conservatives are less generous. Evidence suggests that when it comes to cooperative issues like contributing to charity, conservatives and progressives don't differ in how much they give, so much as who they give to.While progressives are more comfortable with contributing to large anonymous groups (such as charities or governmental agencies), conservative giving is often much more targeted at the local community level.This may partly explain the differences in stance toward climate change, since typical climate change proposals tend to be more global than local.Our findings apply primarily to a developed Western population and more work is needed to generalize beyond this. However, our work offers the promise that a potential way to change minds is to convince people that climate change issues are merely a larger-scale extension of local social dilemmas.The more an individual cooperates in micro-scale social dilemmas, the more likely he or she is to cooperate in the large-scale dilemma of climate change and to believe in its reality.This way of recasting the issue may provide a way of building support for combating climate change across the ideological spectrum.

  "text": "You've heard of food deserts, areas where healthy and nutritious food is all but impossible to find. But now experts are concerned about another public health problem: play deserts.          Play deserts are areas where parks and other spots to run around and play are nonexistent, hard to access or in less safe locations that make parents second-guess taking their children to play there. And a new study from the University of Georgia found that hundreds of U.S. counties fit into that category.About 10% of the country is designated a food desert. But the new research shows a similar percentage of the U.S. lacks playgrounds, parks and other areas for kids to run around.Many of the counties lacking access to play areas were clustered in the Southeast and Southwest. Additionally, pockets of play deserts were most common in rural and suburban areas throughout the country. But in the South, even urban areas lacked adequate play space.\"Parents often consider a park the first place to go for their children to get some exercise and to play,\" said Jue Yang, lead author of the study and a doctoral geography student in UGA's Franklin College of Arts and Sciences.\"But even if you have the park near where you live, if the environment is not safe or it's very difficult to access, then people will not use it,\" said Lan Mu, corresponding author of the study and a professor of geography.Having parks isn't enough. Playgrounds should be safe, accessible and affordableUsing five broad measures of access to play areas (accessibility, availability, accommodation, affordability and acceptability), the researchers used machine learning technologies to determine how the country fares on a county level.The study found that the Southwest is lacking not only in access to play areas but also in play spaces that parents want to bring their kids to.\"In those areas, the quality of the park should be the priority for the policymaker to think about,\" Yang said. \"In some areas, it's really hot, for instance, so community leaders need to make accommodations for that. They could build water features into the parks and create shaded areas where children can play but not be in direct sun.\"In the Southeast, the biggest issues were affordability, accessibility and availability. That means building more parks and open spaces where parents can bring their children to play for free or reduced costs, the researchers said.The researchers plan to make the interactive maps available online in the future to help local, county-level leaders determine how to create more play oases in their communities.

  "text": "Education systems need major reform in the light of lessons learned from COVID, according to a leading education academic.          Klaus Zierer, Professor of Education at the University of Augsburg, Germany, and an associate research fellow at the University of Oxford, U.K., has revealed ways in which the \"collateral damage\" from school closures is still hitting children and young people particularly hard.He examines the evidence in his new book, \"Educating the COVID Generation,\" published on May 17 by Routledge. The author believes policymakers are turning a blind eye not only to the physical, emotional and educational after-effects on children, but also to deep flaws in educational systems which have been exposed by the pandemic.Flaws in the system\"The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the education system and at the same time exposed known weaknesses in a dramatic way. We are stumbling through this crisis from an educational policy perspective\u2026 It is hard to avoid the impression that educational policy is turning a blind eye to this,\" Professor Zierer says.He suggests that three key flaws in education systems have been highlighted by the pandemic. They are:A too-narrow focus on easily-measured mathematical, scientific-technical and linguistic competencies.A tendency for schools to think mainly in terms of \"effectiveness,\" which is only one element of a good education.A lack of \"joy,\" which should be \"the guiding principle for education and teaching.\"The book sets out five key elements for a more joyful education:Reasons: Children and young people need to know why their lessons should matter to them.Feelings: Children's emotions should be taken into account, both in the classroom and in extracurricular activities.Activity: Learning that consists only of listening and executing is ultimately inhumane.Success: Children need to be given challenges through which they can gain a sense of achievement.Community: A new balance is needed between individual achievement and the experience of becoming a team player.Professor Zierer also describes how his own family struggled during COVID\u2014he has three school-age children who were then aged 6, 9 and 11.\"We have not fallen as a family but we have stumbled many times,\" he says. \"It fills me with concern that they have spent more time at home than at school between 2020 and 2022. How is a young person supposed to develop if they are cut off from the outside world, isolated from friends, quarantined again and again, and not allowed to do all the things that make life worth living?\" More information:Educating the Covid Generation: How We Can Prevent the Impending Educational Catastrophe after Covid. www.routledge.com/Educating-th \u2026 p/book/9781032528748Provided byTaylor & FrancisCitation:We must insert joy back into education in the wake of COVID-19, researcher warns (2023, May 17)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-insert-joy-covid-.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_squad": " Power and Progress: Our 1000-Year Struggle Over Technology and Prosperity",
  "text": "The Dark Ages were not entirely dark. Advances in agriculture and building technology increased Medieval wealth and led to a wave of cathedral construction in Europe. However, it was a time of profound inequality. Elites captured virtually all economic gains. In Britain, as Canterbury Cathedral soared upward, peasants had no net increase in wealth between 1100 and 1300. Life expectancy hovered around 25 years. Chronic malnutrition was rampant.          \"We've been struggling to share prosperity for a long time,\" says MIT Professor Simon Johnson. \"Every cathedral that your parents dragged you to see in Europe is a symbol of despair and expropriation, made possible by higher productivity.\"At a glance, this might not seem relevant to life in 2023. But Johnson and his MIT colleague Daron Acemoglu, both economists, think it is. Technology drives economic progress. As innovations take hold, one perpetual question is: Who benefits?This applies, the scholars believe, to automation and artificial intelligence, which is the focus of a new book by Acemoglu and Johnson, \"Power and Progress: Our 1000-Year Struggle Over Technology and Prosperity,\" published this week by PublicAffairs. In it, they examine who reaped the rewards from past innovations and who may gain from AI today, economically and politically.\"The book is about the choices we make with technology,\" Johnson says. \"That's a very MIT type of theme. But a lot of people feel technology just descends on you, and you have to live with it.\"AI could develop as a beneficial force, Johnson says. However, he adds, \"Many algorithms are being designed to try to replace humans as much as possible. We think that's entirely wrong. The way we make progress with technology is by making machines useful to people, not displacing them. In the past we have had automation, but with new tasks for people to do and sufficient countervailing power in society.\"Today, AI is a tool of social control for some governments that also creates riches for a small number of people, according to Acemoglu and Johnson. \"The current path of AI is neither good for the economy nor for democracy, and these two problems, unfortunately, reinforce each other,\" they write.A return to shared prosperity?Acemoglu and Johnson have collaborated before; in the early 2000s, with political scientist James Robinson, they produced influential papers about politics and economic progress. Acemoglu, an Institute Professor at MIT, also co-authored with Robinson the books \"Why Nations Fail\" (2012), about political institutions and growth, and \"The Narrow Corridor\" (2019), which casts liberty as the never-assured outcome of social struggle.Johnson, the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of Management, wrote \"13 Bankers\" (2010), about finance reform, and, with MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, \"Jump-Starting America\" (2019), a call for more investment in scientific research.In \"Power and Progress,\" the authors emphasize that technology has created remarkable long-term benefits. As they write, \"we are greatly better off than our ancestors,\" and \"scientific and technological progress is a vital part of that story.\"Still, a lot of suffering and oppression has occurred while the long term is unfolding, and not just during Medieval times.\"It was a 100-year struggle during the Industrial Revolution for workers to get any cut of these massive productivity gains in textiles and railways,\" Johnson observes. Broader progress has come through increased labor power and electoral government; when the U.S. economy grew spectacularly for three decades after World War II, gains were widely distributed, though that has not been the case recently.\"We're suggesting we can get back onto that path of shared prosperity, reharness technology for everybody, and get productivity gains,\" Johnson says. \"We had all that in the postwar period. We can get it back, but not with the current form of our machine intelligence obsession. That, we think, is undermining prosperity in the U.S. and around the world.\"      A call for 'machine usefulness,' not 'so-so automation'What do Acemoglu and Johnson think is deficient about AI? For one thing, they believe the development of AI is too focused on mimicking human intelligence. The scholars are skeptical of the notion that AI mirrors human thinking all told\u2014even things like the chess program AlphaZero, which they regard more as a specialized set of instructions.Or, for instance, image recognition programs\u2014Is that a husky or a wolf?\u2014use large data sets of past human decisions to build predictive models. But these are often correlation-dependent (a husky is more likely to be in front of your house), and can't replicate the same cues humans rely on. Researchers know this, of course, and keep refining their tools. But Acemoglu and Robinson contend that many AI programs are less agile than the human mind, and suboptimal replacements for it, even as AI is designed to replace human work.Acemoglu, who has published many papers on automation and robots, calls these replacement tools \"so-so technologies.\" A supermarket self-checkout machine does not add meaningful economic productivity; it just transfers work to customers and wealth to shareholders. Or, among more sophisticated AI tools, for instance, a customer service line using AI that doesn't address a given problem can frustrate people, leading them to vent once they do reach a human and making the whole process less efficient.All told, Acemoglu and Johnson write, \"neither traditional digital technologies nor AI can perform essential tasks that involve social interaction, adaptation, flexibility, and communication.\"Instead, growth-minded economists prefer technologies creating \"marginal productivity\" gains, which compel firms to hire more workers. Instead of aiming to eliminate medical specialists like radiologists, a much-forecast AI development that has not occurred, Acemoglu and Johnson suggest AI tools might expand what home health care workers can do, and make their services more valuable, without reducing workers in the sector.\"We think there is a fork in the road, and it's not too late\u2014AI is a very good opportunity to reassert machine usefulness as a philosophy of design,\" Johnson says. \"And to look for ways to put tools in the hands of workers, including lower-wage workers.\"Defining the discussionAnother set of AI issues Acemoglu and Johnson are concerned about extend directly into politics: Surveillance technologies, facial-recognition tools, intensive data collection, and AI-spread misinformation.China deploys AI to create \"social credit\" scores for citizens, along with heavy surveillance, while tightly restricting freedom of expression. Elsewhere, social media platforms use algorithms to influence what users see; by emphasizing \"engagement\" above other priorities, they can spread harmful misinformation.Indeed, throughout \"Power and Progress,\" Acemoglu and Johnson emphasize that the use of AI can set up self-reinforcing dynamics in which those who benefit economically can gain political influence and power at the expense of wider democratic participation.To alter this trajectory, Acemoglu and Johnson advocate for an extensive menu of policy responses, including data ownership for internet users (an idea of technologist Jaron Lanier); tax reform that rewards employment more than automation; government support for a diversity of high-tech research directions; repealing Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which protects online platforms from regulation or legal action based on the content they host; and a digital advertising tax (aimed to limit the profitability of algorithm-driven misinformation).Johnson believes people of all ideologies have incentives to support such measures: \"The point we're making is not a partisan point,\" he says.Other scholars have praised \"Power and Progress.\" Michael Sandel, the Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor of Government at Harvard University, has called it a \"humane and hopeful book\" that \"shows how we can steer technology to promote the public good,\" and is \"required reading for everyone who cares about the fate of democracy in a digital age.\"For their part, Acemoglu and Johnson want to broaden the public discussion of AI beyond industry leaders, discard notions about the AI inevitability, and think again about human agency, social priorities, and economic possibilities.\"Debates on new technology ought to center not just on the brilliance of new products and algorithms but on whether they are working for the people or against the people,\" they write.\"We need these discussions,\" Johnson says. \"There's nothing inherent in technology. It's within our control. Even if you think we can't say no to new technology, you can channel it, and get better outcomes from it, if you talk about it.\" More information:Power and Progress: Our Thousand-Year Struggle over Technology and Prosperity. www.hachettebookgroup.com/titl \u2026 gress/9781541702530/Provided byMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyThis story is republished courtesy of MIT News (web.mit.edu/newsoffice/), a popular site that covers news about MIT research, innovation and teaching.Citation:New book asks whether the benefits of AI will be shared widely or feed inequality (2023, May 17)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-benefits-ai-widely-inequality.html  This document is subject to copyright.

The study, available online and due to be published in the July 2023 issue of the journal Children & Society, found that for every one unit increase in the standardized Office for National Statistics' (ONS) English index of multiple area deprivation, the number of children in care proceedings in English family courts increased by around 70%.The research team analyzed data from the English Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) and area deprivation data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) from 2015 up until 2019.The study, \"Area-deprivation, social care spending and the rates of children in care proceedings in local authorities in England,\" was undertaken by Dr. Steffi Doebler, Professor Karen Broadhurst, Dr. Bachar Alrouh and Dr. Linda Cusworth.The researchers also found that government spending on prevention, such as mother and child support, youth clubs, family help and advice centers, make a difference.Each \u00a31000 increase in social care spend per child, year and local authority has led to a 12% decrease in the rate of children in compulsory family court proceedings.Lead author Dr. Steffi Doebler says, \"Spending on prevention makes a real difference but the benefits are often hidden by the very large impact of deprivation.\"Local authorities in deprived areas are doing their best to support vulnerable families, and they spend more of their budgets on social care than in non-deprived areas.\"But local authorities, especially in the most deprived areas, have been severely affected by austerity cuts over the last 13 years and are scrambling to compensate and afford prevention.\"The study warns that Government funds received by local authorities are not enough to offset the \"devastating effect\" deprivation has had on families and children.\"We see, in highly deprived areas, the severe long-term harms caused by a decade of austerity,\" adds Dr. Doebler.The authors conclude that if the UK government is serious about \"leveling up,\" it needs to urgently reverse its austerity measures, tackle socioeconomic deprivation in local authorities and invest much more funding in preventative social care.

  "answer_squad": " Senet",
  "text": "Games have been played for thousands of years in cultures across the world.          There's the chequerboard game Senet, played in Egypt around BCE 3100. The African cup board game Mancala has been played since BCE 1400. Chess originated in India over 1,500 years ago. And the strategic game Go began in China 2,500 years ago.The Mayan civilization\u2014which flourished in central America from BCE 2000 to 1500 AD\u2014had several popular games. These games were thought to have the supernatural power to predict war. They include a cross-shaped board game called Patolli and a ball game called Pok-a-Tok.Recently, a stone scoreboard was found by archaeologists in Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n peninsula. The Mayan people appeared to have used it to play a ritualistic game with a heavy ball.This game held significant cultural and religious importance for the Mayan civilization. More than a simple recreational activity, it reflected the deep-rooted beliefs and values of the Mayan people. For Mayans, games provided a platform for the expression of physical abilities, the establishment of social order and the connection between the mortal and the divine.The game discovered in Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 symbolizes the delicate balance between light and darkness, embodying a cosmic struggle. Like other Mayan games, it was believed to influence the fate of harvests, the climate, communities and individuals.In Mayan culture, winning a game like this was seen as a sign of divine favor. They believed that victorious people or teams had been chosen by the gods. Those who consistently lost were sometimes offered as sacrifices to the deities. Mayan games were not solely intended for entertainment, but served as ways to connect with the divine.By participating in these games, Mayan people experienced a sense of communal identity and belonging. The rituals and beliefs associated with the games fostered a collective understanding and reinforced the connections between the physical, spiritual and social realms.      What educators can learn from ancient gamesThe concept of the \"magic circle\", introduced by Dutch historian Johan Huizinga, suggests that during games, players enter a temporary world with its own rules and boundaries.This is exemplified in this Mayan find, which involves rules, suspension of normalcy and shared experiences.The magic circle represents a ritual space that both transforms and builds a sense of community. Understanding of this concept can be used to promote inclusion and collaboration in modern day education. Playful experiences within game spaces can facilitate learning and create a sense of belonging, enabling students to grow and learn collectively.Ancient rituals and games possess characteristics like repetition, structure and the use of symbolic objects that aid students in understanding the world. They also offer psychological and social benefits, fostering social bonds, reducing anxiety and improving cognitive flexibility and problem-solving skills.Incorporating ancient and modern games in education promotes soft skills, critical thinking and inclusivity. In fostering communication, giving students agency, and crossing cultural divides, analogue games help students to understand one another better in the classroom.Applying the lessonsThe TEGA project, which we led, created a toolkit to support the development and customization of inclusive analogue games for learning, with an emphasis on accessibility.Analogue games, like tabletop or board games, offer a tangible experience that helps teach abstract concepts which typically lack clear physical representations. Through interaction with game elements such as cards, dice and pieces, student players can grasp abstract ideas like probability and strategy more effectively than through digital games or other media.By considering accessibility needs through their motor, sensory and cognitive dimensions, games can be designed to accommodate a wider range of students. So by incorporating board games into higher education, teachers can create a learning environments that works for all students.

  "text": "There is broad agreement that Homo sapiens originated in Africa. But there remain many uncertainties and competing theories about where, when, and how.          In a paper published today in Nature, an international research team led by McGill University and the University of California-Davis suggest that, based on contemporary genomic evidence from across the continent, there were humans living in different regions of Africa, migrating from one region to another and mixing with one another over a period of hundreds of thousands of years. This view runs counter to some of the dominant theories about human origins in Africa.Competing theories about human origins in AfricaOne theory holds that, about 150,000 years ago, there was a single central ancestral population in Africa from which other populations diverged. Another suggests that this central ancestral population was the result of the mixing of modern humans with a Neanderthal-like hominins (human-like beings), resulting in a leap forward in human evolution, as has been suggested took place in Eurasia.\"At different times, people who embraced the classic model of a single origin for Homo sapiens suggested that humans first emerged in either East or Southern Africa,\" says Brenna Henn, a population geneticist in the Department of Anthropology and in the Genome Center at the University of California, Davis and co-lead author of the research.\"But it has been difficult to reconcile these theories with the limited fossil and archaeological records of human occupation from sites as far afield as Morocco, Ethiopia, and South Africa which show that Homo sapiens were to be found living across the continent as far back as at least 300,000 years ago.\"So, the research team took a different approach.Contemporary genomic evidence tells a different storyIn the first systematic test of these competing anthropological models against genetic data, the team worked backwards from contemporary genomic material of 290 individuals from four geographically and genetically diverse African groups to trace the similarities and differences between the populations over the past million years and gain insight into the genetic interconnections and human evolution across the continent.The groups were the Nama (Khoe-San from South Africa); the Mende (from Sierra Leone); the Gumuz (recent descendants of a hunter-gatherer group from Ethiopia); and the Amhara and Oromo (agriculturalists from eastern Africa). The researchers also included some Eurasian genetic material to include the traces of colonial incursions and mixing Africa.\"We used a new algorithm to rapidly test hundreds of possible scenarios. Those with gene flow back and forth between populations in various parts of the continent over the course of hundreds of thousands of years provided a much better explanation of the genetic variation we see today,\" adds Simon Gravel, Associate Professor in the Department of Human Genetics at McGill University, and co-senior author on the paper.\"We wrote this algorithm to understand how genetic disease risk varies across populations, and it led us to this deep dive into human origins. It's been really fun to tie applied and fundamental research together in this way.\" More information:Brenna Henn, A weakly structured stem for human origins in Africa, Nature (2023).

  "answer_squad": " the disappearance of Russia as a supplier",
  "text": "Prior to Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, Europe sourced a great deal of natural gas from Russia. But as a result of EU sanctions on Russia, this supply is no longer there. European countries have scrambled to find and secure new suppliers. But if both the war and these sanctions last into next winter, gas will remain in short supply\u2014especially if next winter is a cold one and people need a lot of gas for heating.          There is a distinct possibility that a shortage of gas will mean homes go unheated and will force industry to halt production. As a result, some countries might be tempted to prioritize the needs of their own citizenry and economy over showing solidarity to other countries.But how would the effects of such a selfish behavior play out? And how far removed from a show of solidarity would such a scenario be? Researchers in the group of Giovanni Sansavini, Professor of Reliability and Risk Engineering at ETH Zurich, have examined this using model calculations. One of the study's key findings is that collaborating in solidarity is worthwhile. At the very least, it would allow European countries to avert drastic and involuntary energy demand curtailment.Collaborating in solidarity means countries helping each other out when gas is in short supply and signing bilateral agreements to that effect. This would involve a country voluntarily lowering its energy demand in order to supply gas to other countries should they desperately need some. Only eight such agreements have been reached in Europe to date.The alternative to collaborating in solidarity is acting selfishly. Several Central European countries such as Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands would be better off acting selfishly as they would then have more gas available. However, this would cause shortages in other countries. Hardest hit would be countries along the eastern edge of Europe: from Finland down through the Baltic States to the Balkans.Redirected gas flows in EuropeThe main reason for all of this is that the disappearance of Russia as a supplier caused a fundamental shift in Europe's supply channels. Russia used to supply eastern European countries as well as Finland. Although Finland shares a border with Norway, a big producer of natural gas, there is no gas pipeline between these two Nordic countries.Europe is now offsetting its need for Russian gas largely with liquefied natural gas (LNG), which arrives by sea chiefly from the US, Qatar and Nigeria. Most of the ports for handling LNG are found on the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea, with Spain being the largest transfer zone. Production in Norway remains high, as do imports from Algeria, reaching Europe through pipelines to Spain and Italy.In other words, it's now countries in Western Europe that are serving as the continent's gateway to gas. And countries in the east and southeast suddenly find themselves at the end of the supply chain.\"The trouble is that Europe's gas infrastructure wasn't designed for such a shift,\" says Paolo Gabrielli, a senior researcher in Sansavini's group and co-author of the study. Cross-border pipelines are operating at maximum capacity, especially in Southeastern Europe. \"This is why Southeastern Europe is particularly vulnerable to gas shortages and relies on agreements with other countries.\" Gabrielli adds that existing bottlenecks can be removed by additional investments in the gas infrastructure.Based on their results, the researchers are calling on policymakers to coordinate the distribution and consumption of gas at the international level. Moreover, private individuals and companies throughout Europe must be given greater incentives to effect a measured reduction in their gas consumption wherever possible\u2014even when there is no acute shortage. This would help keep gas storage as full as possible so as to be prepared for a cold winter.\"Voluntarily reducing demand to distribute the burden evenly is far less painful than forcing a country to massively reduce its demand because there's no energy available,\" says Jacob Mannhardt, doctoral student in Sansavini's group and lead author of the study. \"International collaboration together with anticipatory energy savings are the most cost-effective way of preventing a severe energy crisis.\"      Reducing climate impact and dependenceIn their study, the ETH researchers analyzed the entire energy system by looking not just at gas but also at other energy sources and the electricity grid. This allowed them to calculate that turning off gas-fired power stations and instead generating more electricity through coal would offset 15 percent of the supply gap left by Russian natural gas. The downside would be climate damage: such a move alone would trigger a 5 percent increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the electricity and heating sector.\"We show that diversification in natural gas supply, and especially LNG imports, have stabilized Europe's gas supply,\" Gabrielli says. \"But Europe must learn its lesson from this energy crisis, namely that it is dangerous to be dependent on foreign countries for its energy supply. Switching to a different foreign supplier merely shifts the dependency.\"To avoid damaging the climate and simply forging new dependencies, the researchers recommend channeling the current momentum into investing in domestic energy supply, expanding renewable technologies, pursuing electrification efforts, and ensuring electricity trading across Europe.The work is published in the journal iScience.

The engravings, dated to between 7,000 and 8,000 years old, depict nearby desert kites, vast structures used to trap animals. The ability to transpose large space onto a small, two dimensional surface represents a milestone in intelligent behavior, and boosts understanding of how kites were conceived and built.          Desert kites were first spotted by airplanes in the 1920s. They are sophisticated archaeological structures made up of walls up to 5km long which converge in an enclosure to trap animals bordered by pits. Such structures are visible as a whole only from the air, yet this calls for the representation of space in a way not seen at this time.R\u00e9my Crassard of CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Lyon, and colleagues, report two engravings that represent kites in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. In Jordan, the Jibal al-Khasabiyeh area has eight kites. A stone with a representation carved with stone tools measuring 80 cm long and 32 cm wide was found nearby and dated to around 7,000 years ago.Zebel az-Zilliyat in Saudi Arabia has two pairs of visible kites 3.5km apart. Here a massive to-scale engraving measuring 382 cm long, 235 cm wide was excavated and the depiction was reportedly pecked rather than carved, possibly with hand picks. This was dated to around 8,000 years ago.Plans like these would have been needed by the constructors as the whole layout is impossible to grasp without seeing it from the air. Until now, evidence for plans of large structures has been seen in rough representations, but these designs are extremely precise.Although human constructions have modified natural spaces for millennia, few plans or maps predate the period of the literate civilizations of Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt. These examples are the oldest known plans to scale in human history.\"The engravings, dated to between 8,000 and 9,000 years old, were discovered in Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

  "text": "People who saw news about human kindness after consuming news about a terrorist attack or other immoral acts felt fewer negative emotions and retained more belief in the goodness of humanity compared to people given just the bad news, according to a study published May 17, 2023, in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Kathryn Buchanan from the University of Essex, and colleague Gillian Sandstrom from the University of Sussex, U.K.          The authors split 1,800 study participants into different groups. Across all the groups, participants were shown one- to three-minute-long video news clips or given brief news stories to read: news reporting on a recent U.K.-based terrorist attack or similar (\"Immorality\" group); reports of kind acts performed in response to the terrorist attack or unrelated kind acts (\"Kindness\" group); lighthearted, unserious material (\"Amusement\" group); and content from the Immorality group plus either the Kindness (\"Immorality and Kindness\") or the Amusement (\"Immorality and Amusement\") group.The \"Immorality\" group participants reported both significant increases in negative emotion and significant decreases in positive emotion, as well as more negative perceptions of humanity and society. In comparison, \"Immorality and Kindness\" participants reported relatively lower increases in negative emotion and lower decreases\u2013or even significant increases\u2013in positive emotion.\"Immorality and Kindness\" participants also reported significantly more positive perceptions of humanity than those in the \"Immorality\" group. The \"Immorality and Kindness\" group reported more effective mitigation of the negative effects of immorality than the \"Immorality and Amusement\" group, both in terms of increases in positive emotion and perceptions of society.The results suggest that positive news can help provide an emotional buffer against negative news. Viewing kind acts, versus merely amusing acts, was especially effective in helping participants retain beliefs about the goodness of others.The authors hope their results will push the media to incorporate more positive coverage, as well as constructive or solution-oriented framing for complex, important issues.The authors add, \"News stories featuring the best of humanity take the sting out of items exploring the worst of humanity. This allows people to believe to maintain a core belief that is crucial for good mental health: that the world and the people in it are fundamentally good.\" More information:Buffering the effects of bad news: Exposure to others' kindness alleviates the aversive effects of viewing others' acts of immorality, PLOS ONE (2023).

  "text": "Skeletal remains preserve direct evidence of the health issues faced by children born into poverty and forced into labor in 19th century England, according to a study published May 17, 2023, in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Rebecca Gowland of Durham University and colleagues.          The large-scale employment of children during industrialization in 18th and 19th century England is well-documented. In many cases, pauper children were forcibly moved out of cities and into labor in rural mills and farms. The poor working conditions at these sites are associated with malnutrition, various diseases, and low life expectancy, but there is little direct evidence of the struggles of these children.In this study, Gowland and colleagues examine skeletal remains of 154 individuals from a rural cemetery in the village of Fewston, North Yorkshire. These remains date mostly to the 19th century and include an unusually high proportion of people aged 8\u201320. Analysis of strontium and oxygen isotopes suggests many of these children were not born in the North Yorkshire region.Comparing these remains to those of local individuals, the researchers found that the non-local children exhibited higher incidences of skeletal issues related to growth delays, vitamin deficiencies, and respiratory disease. Additionally, carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures of the non-local children indicate low-protein diets. Combined with historic documentation of child labor in a nearby mill, these results present a convincing case for children born into poverty and transferred to this village to work in dangerous, even fatal, conditions.This study provides the first direct insights into the harrowing lives of children in forced labor during industrialization in England. Child labor is considered the most common form of child abuse and neglect in the world today. In highlighting the effects of poverty and forced labor on children, this analysis has implications for the past as well as the present.The authors add, \"This is the first bioarcheological evidence for pauper apprentices in the past and it unequivocally highlights the toll placed on their developing bodies. To see direct evidence, written in the bones, of the hardships these children had faced was very moving. It was important to the scientists and the local community that these findings could provide a testimony of their short lives.\" More information:The expendables: Bioarchaeological evidence for pauper apprentices in 19th century England and the health consequences of child labour, PLOS ONE (2023).

  "answer_race": " To call on women to stop economic abuse.",
  "question_squad": " What is the term for economic abuse?",
  "answer_squad": " economic abuse",
  "text": "Women in abusive relationships are more likely to be unemployed and earn less money than women with non-abusive partners.          That's among the key findings confirmed by a landmark international study by researchers from England, America and Finland, which charted the economic impact abusive relationships have on women.The study found that the deterioration in economic well-being started soon after women began living with an abusive male partner. After five years, these women continued to experience significant falls in earnings and employment.What is economic abuse in a domestic relationship?We know from previous research that men use economic abuse to exert power over and exploit their female partners.It can involve using intimidation, threats, humiliation, emotional manipulation, isolation and physical violence to restrict their partner's right to work and access to property, includingpreventing her from taking a jobforcing her to resignundermining her work performancerestricting the type of job they can dopreventing her from accessing bank accountsexcluding her from decision-making over household spending or joint propertypreventing her from accessing joint financial assetsmaking her relinquish control over her property or income, orcompelling her to take on her partner's debt.This abuse sabotages a woman's independence and ability to leave the relationship by limiting her access to money and work outside the home.Economic abuse is more common than many realize. A recent online survey of 15,000 women in Australia found 11% had experienced coercive control. Of this group, just over half reported their partners had used their own or shared money without consent or made important financial decisions without consulting them.      What did the new study set out to do?The new empirical study involved a data set of nearly 14,000 cohabiting couples. The study's authors linked information from unusually comprehensive police and economic databases in Finland to chart men's economic abuse of their female partners.The researchers compared women who had reported domestic abuse to police with a matched sample of women who had not reported abuse.By employing a relatively long time span (from 2006 to 2019), the study was able to chart the points at which physical violence and economic abuse most frequently occurred.The researchers were also able to identify if the women had been in a non-abusive relationship. This allowed them to compare economic outcomes in both situations.What did the new study find?When women in abusive and non-abusive relationships were compared after five years living with a partner, the employment rates for those in abusive relationships fell 12% and their earnings declined 26% relative to their situation before cohabitating.The researchers were able to exclude other factors that might have contributed to this outcome, such as a general economic downturn or working less outside the home after starting a relationship.By referring to other relationships, they could also establish that these negative outcomes had not occurred when the same women had been in a non-abusive relationship.In other words, the negative outcomes were a product of the abuse rather than any characteristics of the victim-survivors. These findings refute claims these women have only themselves to blame.The researchers were also able to identify that a negative impact on economic well-being occurred relatively early in abusive relationships. Women's unemployment tended to increase and their earnings tended to decrease within the first two years of a couple living together.The study also found women \"in the middle\"\u2014those with intermediate levels of education and earnings before entering into a relationship that became abusive\u2014experienced the worst economic outcomes.It's not clear why. Perhaps this was the least predictable group in relation to whether they would leave the relationship and this may have triggered the most control from their abusive partners.The study also found that economic abuse usually preceded physical violence, but could also occur in relationships where there was no reported violence.How to end this abuse?Economic abuse in intimate relationships builds on existing gendered inequities, especially social norms about management of finances.Changing the attitudes and behaviors of perpetrators and potential perpetrators is crucial. Many consent and behavior change programs include economic abuse as a recognized form of coercion and control.It's also important we find ways to improve financial literacy and provide more support for women seeking to leave abusive relationships.Australian banks have already developed useful guidelines and are working with experts in domestic and family violence to promote understanding of this abuse.It's vital that we find ways to support women to deal with the predictable consequences of economic abuse. These include homelessness, home insecurity, unemployment, poverty, and debts accrued by a partner or former partner.Without intervention, a bad credit rating or poor rental history caused by a perpetrator's abusive conduct can blight women's lives for years after they leave these relationships.Taking out a civil protection order may prohibit further economic abuse. New South Wales and Tasmania already have criminal laws targeting coercive control and economic abuse. Queensland is planning to introduce a coercive control offense.Enacting similar laws in other states and territories would extend these protections to even more Australian women.

  "question_squad": " What percentage of people in 2023 said they were unaccepting of gay men and lesbians?",
  "answer_squad": " 32%",
  "text": "A new report shows that Hong Kong public opinion on same-sex couples' rights has changed markedly over the past ten years. Earlier this year, 60% of Hong Kong people said they supported same-sex marriage, while only 17% said they were not supportive, and 23% were neutral. In comparison, 50.4% supported same-sex marriage in 2017, and 38% did so in 2013.          The new report is jointly issued by the Center for Comparative and Public Law at the Faculty of Law, The University of Hong Kong; the Sexualities Research Program at The Chinese University of Hong Kong; and the Human Rights Law Program at the University of North Carolina School of Law. The report is based on the longest running study to track public opinion in Hong Kong concerning same-sex marriage using representative samples.The research was led by Holning Lau from the University of North Carolina, Kelley Loper from the University of Hong Kong, and Yiu Tung Suen from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The team conducted a telephone survey of Hong Kong residents in 2013, repeated the survey in 2017, and repeated it again earlier this year.The survey asked about other issues in addition to same-sex marriage. It found growth in support for gay men and lesbians and their rights across various domains. For example, 71% of people in 2023 said that Hong Kong should have a law to protect against sexual orientation discrimination, compared with 69% in 2017 and 58% in 2013.A remarkably small percentage of people in 2023\u2014only 6%\u2014disagreed with having such legislation. The share of Hong Kong people who said they were unaccepting of gay men and lesbians dropped nearly 20 percentage points between 2013 and 2023 (from 32% to 13%).\"Our study shows that support for the rights of same-sex couples has grown quite considerably in the last decade,\" said Suen. \"The increase in support for same-sex marriage and the decrease in opposition to sexual orientation discrimination legislation are particularly striking.\"Lau noted the legal and social backdrop to the survey. \"A lot has changed over the past ten years. Hong Kong courts have made headlines with rulings that protect same-sex couples. The list of jurisdictions around the world that have legalized same-sex marriage has grown rapidly. Representation of lesbians and gay men in local and global media has also grown. These are some of the factors that formed the backdrop to the shifts in public opinion that we found in our research.\"Still, Loper highlighted persisting discrepancies between public opinion and law: \"Although 71% of Hong Kong people said they favor having a law to protect against sexual orientation discrimination, and only a small proportion of people disagree, the government of Hong Kong has yet to enact such legislation. Same-sex couples also continue to be excluded from marriage, despite majority support.\"The release of the report coincides with the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia (IDAHOBIT), which is observed annually on May 17.

  "answer_squad": " 16.5\u00b0C",
  "text": "Every winter we hear about soaring energy bills and people's inability to stay warm. But, until now, we haven't really known just how cold Australian homes are. Our newly published research suggests around four out of five of Australian homes fail to meet World Health Organization minimum standards for warmth.          Australia has a reputation for being a hot place. It might lead us to think we just need to tough it out through winter, because soon it will be hot again.Our winters may not be as cold as in Europe and North America, but our health statistics are a wake-up call. Our winter death rates are over 20% higher than in summer.Newly updated building codes, and our health and welfare systems, assume most people are OK over winter. This is simply not the case. We need to take winter more seriously.What did the study find?About six years ago, we wondered just how cold Australian homes were. Over the past few winters, we have been measuring people's in-home temperature. Our latest research suggests more than three-quarters of Australian homes were cold last winter\u2014having an average winter temperature less than 18 degrees (the World Health Organization's recommended minimum) during occupied, waking hours.This is startling. Previously, it has been thought that only about 5% of people were cold.For our study, temperature sensors were placed in 100 homes across temperate New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. Two-thirds of Australia's population live in these temperate climate zones.Across the sampled homes, 81% were below 18\u00b0C on average across the whole of winter. The homes averaged 16.5\u00b0C across occupied, waking hours. The coldest homes had a minimum hourly average of just 5\u00b0C.Tasmanians were hardest hit. Some homes in this state had average indoor temperatures of less than 11\u00b0C.But, regardless of state, the majority of homes in our study were unhealthily cold.Who's at risk?Cold isn't just a problem that affects low-income households. The research included homes that were owned outright, mortgaged and rented, across all income levels.Some people might feel comfortable at 16\u2103, but many are not cold by choice. A combination of poor housing conditions, inadequate heating and not being able to afford the cost of heating leaves many struggling to stay warm. And energy prices are set to rise.                Simplified cold homes proportions based on the average temperatures in occupied homes during waking hours. Author provided             The aged, people with a disability and those facing housing insecurity are most at risk. This includes those struggling to pay rent, moving frequently, living in overcrowded homes or spending most of their income on housing. There are also greater challenges for renters.Cold indoor temperatures can make other problems such as mold worse, and can even affect our mental health.We must recognize the connection between health and cold housing. The objectives of housing and health policies must be linked to improve the situation.Australia is shifting towards providing more home-based care, rather than hospital care. This trend means we must be even more careful to ensure home environments are healthy.There is also a need to increase community awareness of the risks of cold housing. At-risk groups include First Nations communities, the aged, the young, disabled and those in insecure housing.Delivering healthier housing is one of the best ways of raising the living standards and quality of life of these communities.      We can learn from successes overseasNew Zealand and the United Kingdom have been tackling cold housing with remarkable success. Both have started by acknowledging a collective social responsibility to address this problem.We, too, must realize the problem is bigger than individual households. National ownership of this problem and a systemic response are required.The NZ and UK interventions have started with rentals, both government and private. Their experience shows mandatory requirements to protect tenants, in particular, need to be made transparent and objective.With almost one-third of Australians renting their homes, such actions could improve the lives of millions of people.Both NZ and the UK used housing surveys to track progress in housing quality over time. This method clearly shows what works best and identifies areas that still need improvement.Similarly, Australia should closely monitor progress towards housing that keeps temperatures at a healthy level. Results should be made public. This would promote continued improvement of housing conditions and help direct investment to policies that deliver the best results.Importantly, we need to keep providing robust research on who is most vulnerable. Our study represents early data from a bigger study of 500 homes, which will enable us to more conclusively identify the true risk of cold housing in Australia.

  "text": "Walking during lockdowns, following protocols and restrictions, city dwellers witnessed the birth of a new architectural aesthetic.          Concern with infection began gradually redefining the space of cities and the social choreography of daily urban life. This has led to a radical rethinking of the limits of architecture. I explored these changes in my new book, Architecture After COVID.It now seems absurd to think about architecture purely in terms of aesthetics or technology. As a greater awareness of hygiene in cities emerged, urban spaces and buildings were reorganized in order to minimize physical surface contact.Contactless design environments became so pervasive that people must now be encouraged, via signs and announcements, to use handrails to avoid the risk of falling. The public became afraid or skeptical of touching handrails, door handles, elevator buttons or any leaning support.Architects have had to adapt to these new design priorities and instincts.COVID-inspired innovationCOVID has led to radical changes as architects have had to drastically rethink the \"craft\" of designing. Their techniques changed in terms of communication, documentation, technical innovation and unconventional ways of \"meeting\" clients or \"visiting\" construction sites.To understand how this happened and better capture how the shift to online working has effected the craft of architects, I devised a small experiment with 130 practices from 40 different countries.In the past I have engaged in lengthy observations of architects at work in different firms, following their work and describing their working culture. The impossibility of visiting firms during the pandemic to engage in direct observation of their work prompted me to adapt techniques that could be practiced from a distance.I asked firms to describe a situation that illustrated how their working routines adapted to COVID restrictions. Paying attention to the work of architects in a period of crisis\u2014how they adjusted working methods and redefined priorities to be able to continue to design\u2014highlighted key skills of the designers.Be they in Buenos Aires or Amman, Los Angeles or Prague, Manchester or Shenzhen, what brought practitioners together was the attempt to rethink the dynamics of how they work.      How the pandemic has changed architectural workMy study found three important changes in architectural practice. First, many architects returned to drawing and sketching, often enhanced electronically.As drawing together in the studio became impossible, designers began expressing ideas in oral and written ways. These \"returns\" prompted design concepts to be clearly articulated beforehand, not in the process of spontaneous exchange around the table.The pandemic also revived the profile of the perfectionist\u2014the calculative pensive architect, the designer who thinks more than acts, the one who writes before sketching. It also freed designers from rigid hierarchies, unlocked the hidden potential of the youngest team members and turned the makers into writers and the shy into the vocal.Second, the pandemic changed the \"technological landscape\" in design firms. Architects began rethinking their working methods, often implementing old technologies, software and storage solutions into their daily work. Some of these technologies and tools had been around since the 1990s but had never been introduced in practice.Third, architects crafted new protocols and tactics for connecting and collecting feedback from clients and new ways of meeting and mobilizing their communities.Some practices went as far as training representatives in territories they could not travel to. This helped them to act and speak like an architect and represent them on the ground.Others conducted design and planning meetings on renovation sites. This resulted in resourceful solutions for crafting new relations with clients, communities and construction sites that enhanced the social skills of architectural professionals and the efficiency of their designs.My study found no miraculous solutions to the challenges and the disruptions created by the COVID pandemic. Yet in their everyday, repetitive design work, architects generated numerous small innovations and adjustments that provided solutions. When they were repeated and adopted by others, these inventions propagated, often leading to bigger changes.Architects appeared more than ever, as resourceful agents that make sense of complex situations and devise materially smart solutions.

  "text": "Companies can increase not only the volume but also the quality of employee suggestions and ideas by offering rewards and a choice, according to a study we published in 2022.          We conducted the study on 345 telemarketers at a call center in Taiwan, which already had a suggestion program set up to solicit creative ideas to improve the organization. The company rewarded those who suggested ideas deemed the most valuable by giving them a trophy.We wanted to see how tweaking the reward changed the quantity and quality of suggestions. So we invited the employees to submit ideas and that if their suggestions ranked among the top 20% most creative ideas\u2014as evaluated by a team of managers and researchers\u2014they would receive one of four rewards: US$80 in cash for themselves, $80 to share with colleagues, $80 to give to a preferred charitable organization or priority when selecting days off. About half of the employees were offered a choice of the four rewards they would receive for submitting ideas. We then randomly assigned one of the four rewards to the remaining employees.In total, we received and evaluated 144 ideas over a one-month period.We found that employees who were given a choice of reward submitted 86% more ideas than those who were told what they would be getting. Moreover, the average creativity score of their ideas was 82% higher. Overall, our suggestion program elicited double the number of ideas as the company's own program and resulted in ideas that were ranked 84% more creative.Soliciting employee ideas can be a key driver of innovation in organizations.When employees share their ideas about products, services or policies using a suggestion program, an organization can take those ideas and refine and then implement them.These implemented ideas can enhance an organization's ability to adapt and compete. A 2003 study of 47 organizations found that ideas submitted to employee suggestion programs saved those organizations more than $624 million in a single year.Our own study suggests small incentives could have a significant impact on the quantity and quality of those employee suggestions.Research is still needed on whether there is an optimal number of rewards that organizations should offer to get more submissions. One past study found that when employees were asked to choose from a large set of rewards, they felt overwhelmed and produced few ideas.Future research can also test whether our results can be found in other types of organizations, with employees in other types of jobs and in other parts of the world. We plan to examine these issues in our future studies of suggestion programs. Provided byThe Conversation  This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Dang Liu, Albert Min-Shan Ko and Mark Stoneking collected genome-wide data from 55 individuals from seven Taiwanese Austronesian groups and two Han-Taiwanese groups to study the genetic structure of Taiwan, the point of origin for all Austronesian-speaking peoples.          There are over 20 different Indigenous groups in Taiwan, divided into \"highland\" and \"lowland\" peoples. Many lowland peoples have intermarried with Han people, and their languages are endangered or extinct. For example, the lowland Makatao showed Han admixture dated within the past 100 years. A highland group known as the Atayal showed the most distinctive genetic profile, suggestive of considerable isolation from other groups in the last 3,000 years.By including published ancient genomes in their analyses, the authors inferred little divergence between the Into- and Out-of-Taiwan groups, with the latter and the present day highland groups showing additional interactions from northern East Asia. The work is published in the journal PNAS Nexus.Austronesian people from outside Taiwan are most closely related to southern highland peoples in Taiwan. Exactly which Indigenous group is the parent of the Austronesian diaspora is still up for debate. Haplotype-based results suggest that the Amis are the source population, which accords with a recent linguistic analysis.However, a different approach, allele-based f4 comparisons, show that the Rukai share more ancestry with groups that left Taiwan than the Amis. The authors speculate that haplotype-based results for the Amis might reflect recent back-migration and contact. According to the authors, the results of the study demonstrate the importance of considering genetic structure within Taiwan when making inferences about the Into and Out of Taiwan events.

  "text": "A new academic study examining the actions of Bernie Madoff, the New York banker behind the world's biggest Ponzi fraud, suggests companies do more to root out \"corporate psychopaths\" within their organizations to prevent financial ruin.          The study, published in the International Journal of Market Research, looked at Madoff's behavior throughout his life including during his business dealings, his trial, and his time in prison.It warns that while people with some psychopathic personality traits tend to get ahead in corporate finance, their recklessness and greed can bring down organizations and even entire economies.Author of the research Dr. Clive R. Boddy, Associate Professor at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), is a pioneer in the field of corporate psychopathy. Around 0.6%-1.2% of the adult population are defined as psychopaths, meaning they possess no conscience, shame, guilt or ability to experience love for or feel empathy towards other people. The term corporate psychopath refers to well-performing psychopaths who work in corporate settings.Madoff's Ponzi fraud centered around the asset management branch of his financial firm and it defrauded thousands of investors across the world. The fraud was uncovered in December 2008 and was thought to be worth around $64billion. He was jailed for 150 years in 2009 and died in 2021 in a prison for inmates with health needs.Madoff's actions were examined against two established scales of psychopathy. These include personality traits such as superficial charm and apparent intelligence; lack of sincerity or truthfulness; a tendency to cheat; a lack of remorse; being emotionally shallow; a lack of self insight; calmness; and apparent rationality.The research suggests Madoff embodied all of these behavioral traits in addition to many others. He was renowned for his bullying towards his detractors, while carefully crafting an image of rationality and competence to those whose opinion was important to him and his business. His ego reportedly remained intact even when in prison, where he showed no remorse for the victims of his crimes.Dr. Boddy said, \"Highly psychopathic senior businesspeople who were quite plausibly genuine psychopaths are visible in commercial history.\"\"This new study aims to understand whether some corporate scandals and bankruptcies feature senior corporate officials who might be workplace psychopaths, and this has demonstrably been the case.\"\"People have often wondered whether Bernie Madoff was in fact a corporate psychopath, and he certainly scored highly on the two measures of psychopathy utilized within this study.\"\"The findings suggest that Madoff's fraud was an outcome of his personality and that similar personalities such as Robert Maxwell and Ken Lay, have behaved in similar ways.\"\"There are likely to be plenty of people in the world of corporate finance with similar psychopathic traits to Bernie Madoff. The job for financial corporations and firms, if they want to give themselves the best chance of avoiding crisis, would appear to be identifying them before they ascend to power.\" More information:Clive R.

  "text": "Human crowd dynamics are best predicted by a visual neighborhood model, based on the visual fields of each person in the crowd. Birds flock, fish school, and human crowds, too, move in a collective motion pattern. Understanding human crowd behavior can be useful for preventing jams, crushes, and stampedes. Mathematical models of collective motion are typically based on characterizing the local interactions between individuals.       One popular approach, called a metric model, is to quantify forces of attraction, repulsion, and velocity alignment for all neighbors within a fixed radius from the focal individual. Alternatively, in a topological model the focal individual might be influenced by a fixed number of near neighbors, regardless of the distance to the focal individual.For their study published in PNAS Nexus, Trenton Wirth and colleagues asked participants to walk in real and virtual crowds of varying densities, then changed the walking direction of some neighbors to see how the participants responded. The authors found that the data produced was better predicted by the metric model than by the topological model.But the best model was based on the visual motions of the neighbors the focal individual could see. In dense crowds, near neighbors may partially or completely block the view of more distant neighbors, removing the distant neighbors from the focal pedestrian's input. Pursuing a visual model promises more realistic simulations of crowd dynamics, according to the authors.

  "text": "It could be the ultimate blend of art and science\u2014a new seven-suite \"space symphony\" inspired and illustrated by NASA's latest mind-boggling images.          The world premiere outside Washington last week of \"Cosmic Cycles\" showcased vivid imagery compiled by the US space agency alongside the first-ever public performance of the music.Henry Dehlinger, the symphony's American composer, describes it as \"almost like a total artwork.\"\"It's not just music, it's not just visuals\u2014it's not a score for a film either,\" the 56-year-old told AFP before the concert.\"It's more of an immersive experience that encapsulates both visuals and sound.\"A similar effort was undertaken over a century ago by English composer Gustav Holst\u2014but when he wrote his famous ode to \"The Planets,\" much in astronomy remained only theoretical.Since then, humans have walked on the Moon, sent roving research labs to Mars and probed across the solar system with powerful telescopes allowing us to peer billions of light-years away.The images from that research, compiled by NASA producers into seven short films, served as the inspiration for Dehlinger.\"I had to almost pinch myself and remind myself that this isn't pretend\u2014this is the real deal. Not science fiction, it's the actual science,\" he said.                National Philharmonic music director and conductor Piotr Gajewski has collaborated with NASA on previous audio-visual projects, but this time it was the space agency that produced the images first.             Piotr Gajewski, music director and conductor of the National Philharmonic, explained that the idea for the project came after previous work with NASA on visuals to go with a double-billing of Claude Debussy's \"La Mer\" (\"The Sea\") and Holst's \"The Planets.\"For their next collaboration, 64-year-old Gajewski said he suggested to NASA \"that we turn the tables on them.\"\"Rather than them getting a piece of music and putting pictures to it, that they start by putting short videos together... of their very, very best work.\"For Wade Sisler, executive producer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, the challenge was worth the effort.\"It's a journey unlike one that I have ever helped anyone take,\" Sisler, 64, told AFP.'Like Van Gogh paintings'The seven-part piece begins at the heart of our solar system\u2014the Sun\u2014with shots of its swirling and gurgling surface, and explosions of particles out to the planets.                The symphony is a seven-part suite, exploring our celestial neighborhood and beyond.             The next two movements focus on NASA studies of our home planet, from a global perspective and then through Earth photographs taken by astronauts in orbit.Apart from photos and videos, interspersed throughout the seven films are a \"mesmerizing collection of data visualizations\" created by NASA, Sisler explained.Data on ocean currents, for example, \"look like Van Gogh paintings when you put them in motion. The colors are beautiful, you see patterns that you never realized before.\"A fourth segment on the Moon is followed by profiles of each planet\u2014including a focus on images of the Martian surface taken by NASA rovers.Jupiter, a \"regal subject\" according to Dehlinger, is introduced by roaring chimes and horns.The symphony also takes a detailed look at recent experiments on asteroids before a big finale of nebulae, black holes and other galactic phenomena.In addition to two performances at venues outside Washington, NASA has released the videos to its YouTube page with a synthesized version of Dehlinger's soundtrack.'A great mystery'To hammer home the equal importance of the music and video, conductor Gajewski explained, they decided not to aim for exact synchronization, but to be more \"fluid.\"That approach allows him \"to find some moments that are different each time and each performance.\"\"We really wanted people to be able to experience the music, the performers themselves, and also the science in a balanced portfolio,\" Sisler added.                Composer Henry Dehlinger said he was often stunned by the vivid imagery as he worked on the symphony.             Knowing the images and missions were real, Sisler said, elicits a stronger audience response in the digital age, when \"you can conjure up anything through AI, conjure up anything in digital effects.\"\"People are interested in real results. Like 'wow, we really went to that asteroid. Wow, we're really bringing it back here to Earth,'\" he said, referring to the daring OSIRIS-REx sample retrieval mission.                A similar effort was undertaken over a century ago by English composer Gustav Holst -- but when he wrote his famous ode to 'The Planets,' much in astronomy remained only theoretical.             That awe-inspiring factor made the images perfect companions to orchestral pieces, Gajewski said.\"What is it that all of a sudden makes us emotionally weak when we hear one kind of music, or proud when we hear different kinds?\" he asked.\"It's all a great mystery, and of course space is the other great mystery, so they complement each other very well.\" More information:www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2 \u2026 -music-collaboration  \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:US 'space symphony' puts stunning NASA images to music (2023, May 17)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-space-symphony-stunning-nasa-images.html  This document is subject to copyright.

The analysis, which is published in Campbell Systematic Reviews, explored components most likely to lead to improvements in housing, health, and other outcomes.       In the analysis of 64 intervention studies and 41 implementation studies mainly from the United States and Canada, investigators found that any type of case management improves homelessness outcomes for people with additional support needs. Case management increased wellbeing, at least in the short term, but there was no evidence that interventions led to improvements in employment, mental or physical health, or substance use.Support for up to three years led to improvements in stable housing, and in-person meetings with a case manager appeared to be more beneficial than mixed (remote/in-person) meetings.\"This review confirms the effectiveness of case management in improving access to housing. It also goes further than previous research studies by exploring the specific features or components of the approach that are most likely to lead to benefits,\" said corresponding author Alison L.

  "question_squad": " What is the Japanese term for moe characters?",
  "answer_squad": " moe-okoshi",
  "text": "In Japan, advertisements featuring anime characters are often used to sell goods and services. Marketing strategies that use anime characters exploit people's feelings toward them. The Japanese slang \"moe,\" derived from the Japanese intransitive verb \"moeru,\" meaning to sprout, has come to represent people's affection for anime characters, sometimes also called \"moe characters.\"          Marketing campaigns employing moe characters have caused controversy due to how they depict women, especially in the context of \"moe-okoshi,\" or moe-based regional tourism promotion.In this regard, a study was conducted recently by Associate Professor Yasuhito Abe of the Department of Media, Journalism, and Communications at Doshisha University, Japan, to investigate the Executive Committee of Daughters of Chita, or CMJI (Chita Musume Jikk\u014d Iinkai, in Japanese), a project for promoting tourism in the Chita Peninsula of Japan. The study was made available online on March 23, 2023, and published in the International Journal of Cultural Studies.\"I sought to gain a deeper understanding of the social and cultural conditions under which public sectors promote moe practices in collaboration with private sectors within the realm of regional promotion,\" explains Dr. Abe.Founded in 2010, CMJI employs content featuring moe characters to promote regional tourism. Most of the content produced under the CMJI project revolves around a group of young female characters, \"the daughters of Chita,\" each of whom represents either a city or town in the Chita Peninsula.In YouTube promotional videos produced by CMJI, moe characters introduce notable locations in the Chita Peninsula by suggestively interacting with the viewers. For instance, a CMJI YouTube video that Dr. Abe scrutinized features a virtual date with a young girl called Mihama Ren, who introduces viewers to Mihama town as a prime location for dating.Moe characters cater to a predominantly male audience and often perpetuate a harmful way of depicting women as sexualized objects, infamous as the \"male-gaze.\" In the study, Dr. Abe explored two aspects of CMJI's tourism promotion campaign: how it depicted regions in the Chita Peninsula as \"looked-upon\" objects, and how it encouraged moe-consumption among its audience.He found that although CMJI garnered significant attention with the use of moe characters, the practice tends to reduce a city or town's rich history to a simplistic narrative that targets certain audiences' feelings toward moe characters. \"Moe-okoshi practice may contribute to the colonization of each area through the embedded male gaze, thus turning local spots into dating spots and constraining the scope of regional promotion to a matter of visibility for particular audiences,\" notes Dr. Abe.He also found that the use of moe-elements in the CMJI project is ethically questionable since it depicts young women as looked-upon objects and promotes heteronormative notions of masculinity among its audience. Moreover, moe-based marketing campaigns run the risk of alienating a subsection of their audience who find the ideals of moe unacceptable.This study is one of the first to look at moe practices employed in marketing from a critical perspective to examine their long-term and far-reaching effects. Since regional promotion strategies employing content similar to moe can have negative effects, Dr. Abe concludes that \"diverse regional promotion practitioners, local governments, and mainstream media outlets in Japan and beyond could emphasize the concept of gender in order to critically evaluate and shape the development of regional promotion strategies.\"The study is an important contribution to understanding how gendered dimensions can not only impinge upon the effectiveness of regional promotion but also involve inherent ethical issues. It makes a strong argument for further research to acquire a better understanding of moe-related regional promotion and its unintended societal consequences.

  "text": "International aid for pre-primary education has fallen further behind an agreed 10% spending target since the COVID-19 outbreak, according to new research.          The report, compiled by academics at the University of Cambridge for the global children's charity, Theirworld, highlights \"continued, chronic\" underfunding of pre-primary education in many of the world's poorest nations, after years of slow progress and pandemic-related cuts.Early childhood education is widely understood to be essential to children's successful cognitive and social development and to breaking cycles of poverty in poorer countries. In 2017, Cambridge research for Theirworld resulted in UNICEF formally recommending that 10% of education aid should be allocated to pre-primary education. Last year 147 United Nations member states signed a declaration agreeing to the target.According to the new report's findings, aid spending is falling far short of this goal and any progress towards the target ground to a halt following the COVID-19 outbreak. The most recent figures, from 2021, indicate that the proportion of education aid spent on pre-primary education internationally during the pandemic dropped by approximately (US)$19.7 million: from 1.2% to 1.1%.The report identifies several reasons for the decline, notably spending cuts by the World Bank's International Development Association, EU Institutions, and by the governments of wealthy nations, such as the UK.Professor Pauline Rose, Director of the Research for Equitable Access and Learning (REAL) Centre at the University of Cambridge's Faculty of Education said, \"Hundreds of millions of children around the world are missing out on high-quality pre-primary education despite clear evidence that prioritizing this will improve their life chances. The overall trend is very worrying.\"      \"Although some progress has been made towards the 10% target, it started from a very low base. Other education levels are still being prioritized amid a general decline in aid spending. International commitments to pre-primary education are good, but we need concrete action.\"The United Nations' 2030 Sustainable Development Goals include the ambition to provide all children with proper childcare and pre-primary education. Over the past seven years, Theirworld and the REAL Centre have systematically monitored aid spending, tracking progress towards this goal.The new report was compiled using the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's creditor report system, which gathers information about the aid contributions of both individual countries and international agencies such as UNICEF and the World Bank.It shows that over the past two decades, the proportion of education aid spending that goes to pre-primary education has never exceeded 1.2%. Between 2020 and 2021, spending on the sector dropped from $209 million to $189.3 million: a decrease of 9.4%, compared with a 6.9% fall in education aid overall and a 0.9% decline in total aid spending. In 2021, aid spending on post-secondary education\u2014the vast majority of which never leaves donor countries\u2014was 27 times higher than that spent on pre-primary, despite widespread acknowledgement of the need to invest in the early years.The report nevertheless also shows that the 10% target is attainable. UNICEF, which has consistently prioritized pre-primary education, spent 30% of its education aid budget on the sector in 2021. Italy increased spending from $2.6 million to $38 million. The majority of this was allocated to the 'National Strategy on Human Resource Development' which focuses on supporting the Jordanian government in strengthening its education system.The research shows that pre-primary aid is highly concentrated from a few donors, leaving early childhood development in poorer countries particularly vulnerable to sudden fluctuations in those donors' spending.Much of the pandemic-induced drop in spending, for instance, occurred because the World Bank cut its investment in pre-primary education from $122.8 million to $70.7 million. Other donors, such as Canada, EU Institutions, France, Norway and the UK, also reduced spending in this area. In 2021, eight of the top 35 education donors allocated no funds to pre-primary education at all.The UK's contribution was lackluster for the world's sixth largest economy, due in part to the Government's controversial decision to reduce overall aid spending from the UN-recommend target of 0.7% of Gross National Income to 0.5%. Between 2020 and 2021, its education aid spending dropped from $703.67 million to $584.95 million. Aid to pre-primary was particularly badly hit, falling from an already low $5.6 million in 2020 to just $1.8 million in 2021, equivalent to a mere 0.3% of its reduced education aid budget.The report also shows that pre-primary education spending tends to be focused on lower-middle income countries rather than the very poorest nations. In 2021, just 15% of aid in this area went to countries classified as \"low income\", while 52.7% was allocated to lower-middle income countries.As a result, some of the world's least-advantaged children have little prospect of receiving pre-primary support. Eritrea and Sudan, for example, received no pre-primary education aid in 2021. In many other poorer countries\u2014such as the Central African Republic, Chad, Niger and Syria\u2014the amount of aid per primary school-aged child was less than $5.Rose said the finding pointed to the need for a model of \"progressive universalism\", where those most in need receive a greater proportion of aid spending. \"The biggest gaps are in the poorest countries, and particularly among the very poorest and least advantaged,\" she said. \"Increasing spending on pre-primary alone will not be enough. We also have to make sure those in greatest need are prioritized.\"The full report will be available on the Theirworld website.

  "text": "A new study analyzing online search terms used every day by millions of Russians suggests that\u2014contrary to official data from Russian polling agencies\u2014the invasion of Ukraine did not lead to a national \"war rally\" in happiness and life satisfaction among the Russian population.          In fact, levels of well-being and public morale in Russia may be close to their lowest in a decade, with internet search data revealing a \"limited appetite among ordinary Russians for the war,\" according to a University of Cambridge report.Research shows that web searches related to anti-war and anti-Putin sentiment surged during the early invasion, and continued to spike at points of military mobilization involving mass conscription. This has tapered off since the Kremlin switched to relying on mercenaries and prison recruits.However, the study also suggests that Western economic sanctions had little effect on Russian households, with the financial situation of consumers and businesses appearing to stabilize rapidly in the spring of 2022.State-sanctioned polling from the Russian Federation is no longer reliable, say political scientists, with data skewed by public fear of speaking against the war or Putin, as well as suspected government manipulation and dubious changes to methodology.Researchers from the universities of Cambridge and Surrey analyzed data collected through Google Trends on a daily basis from 2012 until April 2023, and cross-referenced it with the last 12 months of search data from Russian tech giant Yandex, to assess public sentiment in Russia.They found that, for several years preceding Russia's most recent invasion of Ukraine, web search trends closely matched the data from major Russian pollsters such as the Levada Center and VCIOM. From early 2022, however, results dramatically diverged.Russian polling after the invasion saw Putin's ratings leap to 80%, with self-reported life satisfaction apparently closing in on record highs earlier this year. Yet search engine data shows public mood deteriorating, while searches for terms linked to \"tacit dissent\" rose sharply.The report's authors plan to continue updating their dataset, arguing that online search trends are now a more accurate proxy for Russian public opinion than data from the country's leading survey institutes. The initial report is published by Cambridge's Bennett Institute for Public Policy.      \"Online search data has been proven to be a powerful tool for inferring the beliefs and attitudes of national populations,\" said Dr. Roberto Foa, report co-author from the University of Cambridge. \"Unlike social media data, online searches represent a much wider section of the population.\"\"Web searches are felt to be private, and often reflect internal thoughts and anxieties that people would not wish to broadcast. Such data provides insight into the public consciousness within repressive states, where truth is hidden by a fog of fear and disinformation.\"\"Polling from agencies within Russia shows the war boosted morale, but our research suggests that the national public mood is near its lowest level for a decade,\" said Foa.\"Online search data shows the Russian people are not simply passive subjects. The legitimacy of the regime is being eroded by failure in war and the demand for personal sacrifice at the altar of Putin's dictatorship.\"The researchers tracked rates at which certain words and phrases were web-searched. These included mental health symptoms such as 'depression' and 'insomnia' to indicate well-being, and terms related to personal finance emergencies such as 'bankruptcy' and 'eviction' to measure the state of household finances.Well-being search trends closely matches the pattern of VCIOM polling on life satisfaction right up to February 2022, when VCIOM data leapt by fifteen percentage points, while online search data for well-being flatlined.The detailed nature of the web search data allowed researchers to create a weekly rolling average of national well-being in Russia, which shows a continual overall decline following the onset of war.A mild bump in public sentiment occurred right at the point of invasion\u2014but was extinguished as soon as 4 March 2022, when the Kremlin passes the War Censorship Act.By April of this year, public mood among Russians was at its lowest since the invasion and only marginally higher than a 2021 nadir during the worst of Russia's coronavirus crisis.Google and Yandex data shows levels of financial stress quickly bounced back to pre-war levels, with initial shocks from Western sanctions only lasting throughout March 2022 for Russian households.However, the financial impact of the pandemic on Russians was severe, with little government help, and sanctions \"blunted\" what had been a steady recovery, say researchers, who found no lift in economic sentiment since the war. Yet official polling has financial satisfaction at a five-year high.The study also looked at anti-war searches such as \"pacifism,\" \"no war\" and anti-Putin phrases\u2014the portmanteau \"Putler,\" for example\u2014to gauge the extent to which many Russians privately contemplate political dissent when online.Searches for names of outspoken Putin critics Boris Nemtsov (assassinated) and Alexei Navalny (imprisoned) as well as famously anti-authoritarian writers\u2014from Orwell to Solzhenitsyn\u2014were included in the analysis.Anti-war and anti-regime online searches saw huge spikes around conscription announcements, such as the call-up of aging reservists in May 2022 and last September's partial mobilization order, along with smaller but still significant jumps during periods of heightened Russian casualties.\"Ordinary Russians are more likely to think critically of the regime and search online for opposition movements when the chances increase that they or their loved ones will be sent to fight,\" said co-author Dr. Roula Nezi from the University of Surrey.\"Russia may have a vast population to draw on, but the Kremlin risks a tipping point of public dissent if it keeps forcing Russian citizens to fight in Ukraine. This could explain a growing reliance on aerial bombardment and use of convicts in the fighting,\" said Nezi.Web search data tallies with this shift in Russian tactics. Since last autumn, what researchers describe as \"cognitive dissent\" has stayed at much lower levels while the Kremlin has been emptying prisons onto frontlines and leaning on long-range assault rather than mobilizing its citizens.

  "text": "Black adults\u2014particularly Black women\u2014with higher levels of education and experiences of discrimination and crime are more likely to own a firearm, according to a study by the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center at Rutgers.          In a new study appearing in the Journal of Clinical Psychology, researchers found that Black adults who endorsed firearm ownership were more likely to have grown up in homes with firearms, had previously shot a firearm, and planned to acquire a firearm in the coming year.\"The higher rates of firearm ownership among highly educated Black women were somewhat surprising to us,\" said Michael Anestis, executive director of the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center and senior author of the study.\"This might reflect a broader shift toward women and persons of color purchasing firearms across the United States in recent years, perhaps as a reaction not only to the turmoil of the pandemic era, but also to frequent highly publicized episodes of police brutality against Black men and women and the surge of gun violence witnessed across the U.S. during that time.\"Recent research shows that since 2019, half of all new firearm owners in the United States identify as female.Risk for injury and death\u2014whether by suicide, unintentional shooting or domestic violence\u2014increases sharply when firearms are kept in and around the home. Recent research has highlighted that Black men and women represent an increasing percentage of the firearm owning community.Despite this, little research has focused on what distinguishes Black adults who do and don't own firearms. In the Rutgers study, researchers at the center surveyed two groups of English-speaking adults. The first group included 502 individuals who identified as Black and were recruited from a national sample in mid-2020.The second sample included 1,086 individuals who identified as Black and were recruited from a sample drawn from New Jersey, Mississippi and Minnesota in early 2021. Each participant was asked about their experiences with firearms as well as factors related to their identities. In the second sample, participants were also asked about their experiences with discrimination, crime and suicidal thoughts.In the second sample, researchers examined how extent adverse life experiences were associated with firearm ownership. Those with more experiences of discrimination, who had encountered more crime, and who felt less safe in their neighborhoods were more likely to endorse firearm ownership.Black adults who endorsed firearm ownership were also more likely to experience suicide thoughts than Black adult who did not own firearms, according to the study.Given the increased risk for death by suicide when a firearm is kept in or around the home, this indicates that Black adults at the greatest risk for thinking about suicide also are more likely to have ready access to the most lethal method for suicide. This last finding may help explain the sharply increasing rate of firearm suicide among Black U.S. residents.\"For Black Americans, experiences of racism and systemic inequalities may result in the decision to purchase a firearm to protect themselves and their loved ones,\" said Allison Bond, lead author of the study and a doctoral student with the New Jersey Gun Violence Research Center.\"However, owning a firearm also increases the risk for death by suicide. This is concerning given that Black firearm owners are reporting high rates of suicidal thoughts. Individual and system level prevention and intervention efforts are needed to combat racism, increase secure firearm storage among the Black community and connect those at risk for suicide with evidence-based mental health care.\" More information:Allison E.

  "answer_squad": " income smoothing",
  "text": "Spooked by volatile reports from the Silicon Valley Bank in early March, many customers panicked and withdrew their money, creating the largest bank failure since the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The problem\u2014investors and customers lost confidence in the bank, proving the perception of a bank's reliability can significantly impact its success.          Investors tend to respond negatively to volatility in firms' performance. To mitigate investors' concerns, when some banks receive extremely high income, they occasionally delay reporting that amount until a later date when the income has dropped. In most cases, this practice is completely legal and is known in the industry as \"income smoothing.\"A new study at the University of Missouri shows that the frequency at which banks participate in income smoothing may be lessened by government guarantees\u2014or guaranteed support from the government in the event the bank needs help ensuring every customer has access to their money. For the study, Felipe Bastos Gurgel Silva, an assistant professor in the Robert J. Trulaske, Sr. College of Business, analyzed the reports of several European banks during two historical situations when the amount of their government support fluctuated.\"The banking sector wouldn't function at all without government guarantees,\" Silva said. \"They help the banks be prepared for extreme situations. And we found that as a result of this, the banks feel less pressure to artificially create the perception of performance consistency in their public reports.\"Silva and a team of researchers, including Manuela Dantas, an assistant professor at California State University-Northridge, and Ken Merkley, a professor at Indiana University, analyzed several reported numbers, including loan loss provisions and pre-provision earnings. Because government guarantees cannot be randomized as they often are in biotech trials, the researchers analyzed two situations where government guarantees changed due to \"external\" factors not related to the individual banking sectors of their study. Specifically, the authors analyzed the increase in implicit government guarantees caused by the creation of the Eurozone and the removal of explicit government guarantees granted to the Landesbanken, a group of large state-owned banks in Germany.The Eurozone creation in 1999 happened for geopolitical reasons. However, the creation of a monetary union and the European Central Bank as a lender of last resort increased the implicit government guarantees of the banks headquartered in the first countries that formed the Eurozone. Conversely, the Landesbanken had their explicit guarantees removed in 2005 because other banks in Germany complained that such guarantees violated terms of the European Union Treaty.\"While our study of the Eurozone creation does not prove a causal relationship, we show the findings can be applied to many banks, not just the ones studied,\" he said. \"And while the findings about Landesbanken may not be proven to be applicable to other banks, we were able to find much more of a causal relationship between government guarantees and income smoothing. Together, the fact that we study two complementary settings and that the results of the two are directionally consistent give us a great sense of how these guarantees impact banks all over the world.\"While income smoothing adds to the total amount of manipulation in public reports, Silva said there are positives and negatives about the trend. He suggested that if reports are smoother overall, it boosts the total amount of investors in the market, potentially positively impacting the economy. However, he said prior research also shows it may be beneficial to limit the total amount of income smoothing occurring at once to help decrease manipulation overall.\"There is prior research, by people right here at the University of Missouri, that shows that accounting manipulation can be an indicator of an upcoming recession,\" Silva said. \"Income smoothing is one form of accounting manipulation. Even though it isn't necessarily done with the intent of manipulating investors' perceptions, many argue it still is a form of distortion.\" More information:Manuela M.

  "text": "Sanctions targeting Russian government officials have been significantly more effective at barring those individuals from the global financial system since the invasion of Ukraine, according to a study from researchers at The University of Texas at Austin.          In an experiment comparing the effectiveness of targeted sanctions before and after the invasion, UT Austin faculty members Michael G. Findley and Daniel L. Nielson and their collaborator, J.C. Sharman at the University of Cambridge, posed as potential customers\u2014including Russian officials first sanctioned in 2012\u2014seeking access to the global financial system. The results of the experiment's two phases suggest the 2012 sanctions only became effective a decade later, after the outbreak of war and the dramatic increase in international scrutiny.In about 5,000 emails to business law firms and other corporate service providers, the research team sought to set up shell companies and international business bank accounts. In half the emails sent, they assumed the names of individuals targeted in Russian sanctions laws. In the other emails, they posed as customers from low-corruption countries such as Australia and New Zealand.In response to emails sent between November 2019 and December 2020, before the invasion of Ukraine, the researchers found that names explicitly barred by Russian sanctions laws still had more or less the same access to those global financial services as people not listed. But in the second phase of the study, conducted in May 2022, a few months after the invasion began, it became much more difficult for sanctioned individuals to access financial services. In 2020, it took an average of 14 email inquiries for a sanctioned Russian official to acquire an anonymous shell company; by the middle of 2022, that average had doubled.\"These findings suggest that war, not law, proved important in sanctions enforcement,\" said Nielson, a professor in UT Austin's Department of Government. \"This is a critical question, since economic sanctions are the main nonviolent means of coercive diplomacy in today's world. And, of course, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, this is a pretty burning question.\"But the researchers are careful to note that more effective sanctions still are not perfect. \"Even though it's much more difficult for sanctioned individuals to get access to the global financial system, we find it striking that they still have access,\" Nielson said. \"Because emails are cheap to send, the costs to Russians seeking to evade sanctions do not seem to be extreme, even after the Russian invasion.\"Financial sanctions have become an essential part of any country's statecraft and a key tool in the West's response to Russian aggression. But previous studies of sanctions' efficacy have focused primarily on sanctions that affect governments directly, the researchers write, rather than sanctions that target individuals.\"Before this research, there was no rigorous experimental evidence about the effectiveness of sanctions on individuals, or 'smart sanctions,' such as those naming the Russians closely associated with the government's invasion of Ukraine,\" Nielson said. \"Our initial results led us to conclude that there was little evidence that smart sanctions are effective in normal circumstances. However, the war appeared to significantly increase scrutiny of Russian individuals and made it more difficult for them to access international financial services.\"The team's investigation initially grew out of their work auditing compliance with global financial transparency standards. Testing the extent to which financial middlemen, such as business law firms and other corporate service providers, complied with Russian sanctions was the last piece of their initial audit. That research, which became the first half of their new study, concluded in November 2020.\"At that point, we detected no meaningful difference in access to the global financial system for Russian names on a sanctions list compared to innocuous customers,\" Nielson said. \"After Russia invaded Ukraine, we saw an opportunity to check if anything had changed. And it has, quite dramatically.\" More information:Michael G. Findley et al, Testing the Effectiveness of Targeted Financial Sanctions on Russia:\rLaw or War?

  "text": "For most of U.S. history, tattoos have been associated with sailors and bikers, but not church-going people. As tattoos have become more popular, with nearly one-third of U.S. adults sporting at least one tattoo, religious-themed tattoos have also increased. A recent study examined the behaviors of college students with tattoos, including religious tattoos.          Jerome R. Koch, Ph.D., professor of sociology at Texas Tech University, and Kevin D. Dougherty, Ph.D., professor of sociology at Baylor, investigated the relationship between tattoos, religiosity and assumed behaviors. Koch and Dougherty published their research, \"Tattoos, Religiosity, and Deviance Among College Students,\" in the journal Sociological Focus.The researchers used survey data from 3,525 students at 12 American colleges and universities to determine whether there is a negative association between tattoo adornment and religiosity, and whether the type of tattoo (religious or secular) is related to deviant behaviors such as drinking, drug use and sexual activity.Results demonstrate college students with tattoos are similar to their untattooed classmates in regard to their religious faith and frequency of prayer. However, students with religious tattoos have a stronger faith, pray more and attend religious services more often than students with no tattoos or secular tattoos.\"Religious tattoos tend to be a vivid expression of strong faith and regular religious practice,\" Koch said.In contrast, findings also show students with religious or secular tattoos are similar in other surprising ways such as marijuana use and sexual activity.\"Students with religious tattoos are highly religious in some ways but strikingly secular in others,\" Dougherty said.A potential explanation for this irony may be that tattooed individuals are sensation-seekers. The emotional content and practices associated with tattoos and religion may parallel each other in specific ways. Both tattoos and religion can signify belonging, identity, restoration, celebration and a commemoration of birth and death. These kinds of incidents and emotions are especially evident in the lives of those who hold strong religious beliefs and engage in religious experiences. In short, tattoos and religion are sensational.\"The religiously tattooed are more likely to use marijuana and be sexually active than those with no tattoos. Thus, the behavior of those with religious tattoos is more similar to those with secular tattoos and distinct from those with no tattoos. Tattoos, religious or otherwise, seem to be associated with a more sensory way of life,\" Koch said.This research adds to the scholarly understanding of how aspects of identity are connected to tattoos and religion. Koch and Dougherty began collaborating on religious tattoos in 2018. Their collaborations have produced two journal articles and a book chapter. They have plans for more research together.\"Religious tattoos are a fascinating example of how people connect with and communicate their faith,\" Dougherty said. \"Social scientists have largely ignored religious tattoos. Our research brings attention to these marks of faith.\"Tattoos are popular, especially among Millennials and Gen Z. Religious tattoos reveal that religion still matters to younger generations of Americans, but the influence of religion may be different than it was for previous generations.

  "text": "In 1914, two beads were found under the great ziggurat of A\u0161\u0161ur in Iraq, in a foundation deposit dating from around 1800-1750 BC. Their material has now been identified as amber using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR). The beads represent some of the earliest amber specimens in southwest Asia and also some of the most distant discoveries from the find areas in the Baltic region.          A\u0161\u0161ur (now Qala'at Sherqat), on the west bank of the Tigris in Iraq, is one of the most important archaeological sites in northern Mesopotamia. The beginnings of the settlement go back to the 3rd millennium BC. Starting from the late 19th century BC the city became the center of an Assyrian territorial state.From 1903 to 1914, the Royal Museums in Berlin and the German Orient Society conducted excavations in A\u0161\u0161ur under the direction of Walter Andrae (1875\u20131956). One of the aims of the excavation was to study the great ziggurat (stepped temple tower). In April 1914, in search of the foundation layers, the excavators widened an existing old tunnel.In doing so, they uncovered several thousand beads of shell, stone, glass and pottery lying directly on the bedrock beneath the first layer of mudbricks. On the basis of find-sharing agreements, parts of the find ended up in the collection of the Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin.Among the beads were two disk-shaped ones whose material differed from the rest. They have now been re-examined by researchers from the State Office for Heritage Management and Archaeology Saxony-Anhalt, the Martin-Luther-University of Halle-Wittenberg and the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin.Fragments of the two beads were examined in 2019 by the Rathgen-Forschungslabor der Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin\u2014Stiftung Preu\u00dfischer Kulturbesitz using Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Despite severe weathering, the spectra broadly matched those of Baltic amber (succinite), suggesting that the amber beneath the great ziggurat of A\u0161\u0161ur most likely originated in the Baltic or North Sea region. They belong to the period around 1800 BC or the first half of the 18th century BC.Long-distance contacts in the Early Bronze AgeThe beads thus represent one of the earliest examples of amber in southwest Asia and also one of the most remote from the source areas in the Baltic region.The extreme rarity of amber in the Mediterranean and the Near East before about 1550 BC and the restriction to high-ranking contexts can be explained by the fact that the Central German \u00dan\u011btice culture, whose wealth and importance is expressed, for example, in richly furnished princely tombs (Leubingen, Helmsdorf, Bornh\u00f6ck) and the Nebra Sky Disk, controlled the paths over which the amber could reach the south.The extremely rare amber finds from the early 2nd millennium BC are probably exclusive gifts from well-traveled people from Central or Western Europe to the elites in the south. After the end of the \u00dan\u011btice culture around 1550 BC., the picture changes and widespread trade is established, which made amber available in larger quantities in the Mediterranean and the Middle East.The paper is published in the journal Acta Archaeologica.

  "text": "Students from schools in low-income communities did not suffer significant \"learning loss\" during the pandemic years of 2020-2021, but instead improved in certain areas of study.          That's one key finding from our research, published recently in the journal The Australian Educational Researcher.In fact, we found students considered most at risk of \"learning loss\" during the pandemic actually achieved greater growth in mathematics and equivalent growth in reading in 2021 when compared with a similar group of students from 2019.Our results reveal one silver lining from the past three challenging years, and underscore what's possible when programs aimed at helping the most disadvantaged students are well funded.Overall, however, we still have a long way to go to remove pervasive and structural inequities baked into Australia's school systems, and to narrow achievement gaps.What we did and what we foundOur study involved data on Year 3 and 4 academic results, collected as part of a randomized controlled trial with 125 New South Wales public schools.From this data we carried out two studies\u2014one comparing student results in 2020 to 2019, the second comparing 2021 to 2019.In other words, one analysis compared student results from the first year of the pandemic with pre-pandemic kids. The other compared academic results of pre-pandemic kids with those who'd lived through consecutive years (which included remote learning).The groups of students for each year of the study\u20142019, 2020 and 2021\u2014were carefully \"matched\" so we could be confident we were comparing like with like.When comparing 2020 and 2019 cohorts, we found no significant differences overall in math or reading achievement.However, analyzing these same data by school Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage (a measure of school-level advantage that accounts for school location, parent education and percentage of Indigenous students) revealed worrying inequities.In this 2019 and 2020 comparison (which compared pre-pandemic students to those living through the first year) we found students in disadvantaged schools achieved less growth in math. Those in mid-range schools had achieved slightly more.Then when the pandemic continued, we were able to also compare pre-pandemic kids (the 2019 group) with those who'd lived through both years (the 2021 group).This allowed us to measure the impact of consecutive years of disrupted learning.Surprisingly, we found students from disadvantaged schools achieved three months additional growth in math and equivalent growth in reading compared to their 2019 pre-pandemic peers.Meanwhile, students in mid-range and advantaged schools achieved about the same as their pre-pandemic peers.      Concerns about 'learning loss'Early in the pandemic, teachers, parents, researchers, government, and the media worried and speculated that student results would decline.As our research shows, major concerns about widespread diminishing academic achievement did not materialize.Even where students did not achieve at the same rates as they did in pre-pandemic years, they still learned.In hindsight, the idea of \"learning loss\" or of students' learning going backwards was likely a source of unnecessary worry for families.However, overseas results show Australia was an outlier.World Bank analysis of 35 empirical studies on the impact of COVID-19 on student learning concluded students around the world fell behind by \"roughly a one-half year's worth of learning.\"It also found students from disadvantaged contexts were more likely to be negatively affected.Researchers at Harvard University found remote and hybrid learning during the pandemic contributed to significantly widening achievement gaps for disadvantaged students.In this global context, the recent academic achievement of students in our NSW studies are cause for real celebration.What's behind these results?When the pandemic brought lockdowns and uncertainty, governments and education departments around Australia found hundreds of millions of dollars to put toward preventing students from falling behind.The NSW Department of Education's tutoring scheme, launched in 2021, may have contributed to the positive academic results we found.The COVID intensive learning support program funded schools to employ more educators to deliver small group literacy and numeracy tuition to students identified as needing it most.The program has been extended to June 2023, but has been criticized for not being particularly well targeted.The widespread teacher shortage has also been a factor. Hard-to-staff schools in disadvantaged and rural and remote areas, where arguably tutoring was needed most, reported struggling to hire classroom teachers let alone additional educators for the tutoring program.It's also possible our key finding could be explained by the strict focus on literacy and numeracy in primary schools when students returned after periods of remote learning.However, this \"back to basics\" focus\u2014at the exclusion of sport, assemblies, excursions and the other extracurricular activities that punctuate school life\u2014may also have negatively affected student and teacher well-being.Where to from here?The achievement gap between students from marginalized groups and their more advantaged peers looms large in the Australian education system.The students in our study from disadvantaged schools, while showing academic improvement in math in 2021, still started and ended the year well behind their more advantaged peers.In fact, their achievement level at the end of 2021 was still below where students in advantaged schools began their school year.There are clear lessons to be learned from the pandemic and our research on its effects.For decades, funding models left marginalized students at real disadvantage. But when the pandemic hit, governments were able to find significant funding for programs and initiatives actually targeted at those with the greatest need.Can such special funding be sustained to stem ongoing inequities in Australian schooling? David Gonski, appointed by the Gillard government in 2011 to review Australian school funding models, certainly thought so.Our results could not be more timely. Federal education minister Jason Clare recently announced an expert panel and ministerial reference group to advise on a new National School Reform Agreement.This agreement sets out five-year initiatives and targets, which are tied to funding and agreed between the federal government and states. It represents our best opportunity to finally get school funding right. Provided byThe Conversation  This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

For many this could be seen as dressing \"badly\" but Y2K (2000s fashion) is all the rage at the moment.          Fashion has long been one of the most creative playgrounds to express yourself and also define your personal identity and status. Gen Z take this very seriously. However, they are no mere followers of fashion but are adventurously carving out their own trends and styles\u2014joyfully playing with the way they dress and express themselves through their clothes.Gen Z are rejecting everything from outdated gender tropes to curated color schemes and the idea of the \"perfect\" body.For several hundred years, it was the fashion industry who controlled what was on trend. It was in bed with the media, style icons, designers and the tycoons of the industry. This relationship has enabled trends to be predicted and for aesthetic movements to be planned and consumers to be catered for. The masses watched and waited to be told what was new and \"hot.\"This relationship is now being short-circuited by a generation of digital natives who live in a world where the distinction between the digital and the physical is blended.Gen Z will not be dictated to, they are not anxiously waiting to be told they are on trend, on social media they are making heir own trends by breaking rules, embracing creativity and finding joy in dressing bravely.The democratization of fashionEach generation has changed fashion. The baby boomers brought us flower power in the 1960s and 1970s using free love in contrast to their parents' clearly defined social and gender roles.Boomers' younger siblings brought us \"punk\" in the 1970s and 1980s, a subculture dedicated to using the symbols of the state against itself and deliberately playing with the obscene and vulgar. This was amid a global political climate of conservatism and repression.Then again in the 1990s we saw grunge, Gen X's response to a futureless world post-cold war.Well, Gen X have had children and those kids have decided that they find joy in dressing outside of the lines (so to speak), you can be anything, you can be everything and you can be nothing.Gen Z (and even millennials) have witnessed the ever-increasing democratization of fashion through social media sharing and the global reach of online platforms. They have seen thousands of tiny subcultures formed online where they undergo a near constant cycle of evolution, explosion and reformation.Take the early 2000s \"emo\" trend. Once a big subculture, it was thrust to the corners of the internet where everyone thought it would languish and die.However, emo is experiencing a revival with people wearing all black, corsets becoming cool again and heavy eye makeup being sported by the likes of Gen Z darlings Willow Smith and Olivia Rodrigo.But Gen Z are not sticking to one style. Fashion has become a pick and mix of trends and ideas where an individual can use the ingredients to create and recreate identity as often as they desire. There is joy in dressing, not fear. There are no rules.      No rulesAs new fashion consumers gleefully reinvent notions of good taste and beauty, the traditional trickle-down effect for trends has been replaced by a bubbling up from new sources defining what's new and what's next. From Instagrammers to icons, vloggers and TikTokkers, the sources for trends are broad and varied.Young people are creating their own place in a new world. A world where crocs are high fashion and what \"goes\" is in the eye of the beholder. Boxers as a headdress or leggings as scarf? sure. Why not even wear a keyboard as a top? Maximalism is being taken to new extremes as clothes are layered over more clothes and no color, object or pattern is out of bounds.These are the COVID kids, a generation that came of age during a global calamity where the only form of communication was digital and two-dimensional.The loudest and boldest and most insane outfit is the one that will get you most attention on screen. For kids used to consuming media through TikToks rather than glossy editorials, only the most dramatic, fun and playful will do. Fashion has taken itself way too seriously for way too long. A cleansing fire of young, creative people is exactly what is needed right now. We should all take a page out their book and find joy in dressing in whatever we want.

  "text": "If you are a third grader, your chances of growing up to be a computer scientist is likely to heavily depend on your gender\u2014a situation Allison Master says is just plain wrong.          How can Master be certain? Because third grade girls are telling her so.\"Our new research addresses a big, longstanding issue in STEM education, that women are highly under-represented in fields like computer science. It's actually one of the most challenging fields for women's representation. Only about 20% of people who major in computer science are women,\" said Master, assistant professor of psychological, health and learning sciences at the University of Houston College of Education. She also is lead investigator of a new study published in the journal Early Childhood Research Quarterly.The study traces the inequality back to early elementary-school ages, to see whether coding and other computer science tasks will be welcomed by most boys but likely shunned by girls. But it's not the children, themselves, creating such assumptions. The research team found that girls had views favoring girls, which suggests the stereotype is more likely to come as they get older from adults in their lives and the popular media that surrounds the children.Her investigations make her something of a pioneer in the field.\"There hasn't been a lot of research in this area,\" Master said. In a previous publication, she and her research team studied kindergarten through 12th grade students' approach to STEM-related studies and in this new study took a deeper look through a survey study of first, second and third graders' motivation for computer coding. Their findings reveal two main trends: equality and widening gaps. The youngest girls and boys proved to be equal in their interest in learning skills needed for coding and confidence in the lessons.\"What's really lovely about this research is we find that girls in first through third grades feel very welcoming about coding and computer science. They believe they are going to be good at coding and will enjoy learning it,\" Master said.A shift in girls' interest in computer coding and decrease in their confidence to learn starts around third grade. Boys' interest and confidence continue to grow over the years. But among older girls, negative stereotypes creep in.      \"By the time the girls are in middle school and look around at who's taking advantage of computer science activities\u2014the after-school clubs, the summer camps\u2014it's mostly boys. And when adults talk about these fields, negative stereotypes get communicated further. As years go on, the coding camp opportunities and science-related birthday gifts tend to go more often to sons and not to many daughters,\" Master said.What causes the about-face in third grade? \"It's no coincidence that this is approximately the age when kids start taking notice of things like social media, as well as books and TV programs that usually depict smart scientists as white or Asian men, rarely a woman of any description. It sends a huge signal,\" Master said.To counter those stereotypes, Master and her colleagues are sharing their findings with teachers via their open-access article, \"Gender Equity and Motivational Readiness for Computational Thinking in Early Childhood\" (Early Childhood Research Quarterly). And they are reaching out to middle school girls and boys to determine what would inspire them to enroll in more computer science classes.\"Right now, we're interviewing middle schoolers and getting their video testimonials about what they love about doing coding,\" Master said. \"We hope to build some materials that could inspire interested students, including more girls, to be excited about diving into foundational computer science classes.\"They are reaching out also to younger grades, where the stereotypes have not yet set in. \"Our research supports this is a great time to introduce the lessons to girls. And if you get them started early and give them these positive experiences, they will want to continue with it when they get older,\" she said.Potential benefits spread far beyond the classroom demographics, as Master sees it.\"Because technology and computer science have so many important influences in our society and the ways we can help one another, I think it's important that we open the doors to broader participation in computer science. We need diversity of ideas and the full range of perspectives from the greater community,\" she explained.

  "text": "Consumers paid high energy costs while electricity generators saw enormous increases in revenues beyond their costs, finds a new report by UCL researchers that traces the revenues of the UK's electricity generation sector during the 2022 energy crisis.          In the report, \"Where does the money go? An analysis of revenues in the GB power sector during the energy crisis,\" researchers found that electricity consumers in the UK paid \u00a329 billion more in 2022 compared to pre-COVID levels, an increase of about \u00a3500 per person. The report draws on publicly available datasets and analyzes the structure of revenues generated by different sources of electricity generation in the UK.Of the \u00a329 billion revenue increase, about 70% went to natural gas, and renewable energy producers with \"renewable obligation credits.\" The rest went to nuclear, biomass and coal generation. Gas generators tripled their total revenues from about \u00a36 billion in 2018/2019 to \u00a319 billion in 2022. These renewables doubled their total revenue from about \u00a37.7 billion in 2018/2019 to \u00a315.5 billion in 2022.Lead author Professor Michael Grubb (UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources) said, \"The exploding costs to consumers over the last year highlight the need to disentangle the UK's electricity market from the volatile prices of fossil fuels, and to better embrace the cost predictability and stability that renewable energy can provide.\"The structure of the UK electricity market means that the cost of electricity is set by the most expensive type of generator in order to meet demand, but this means higher costs for consumers. The war in Ukraine increased the wholesale costs of gas, pushing up electricity costs for both fossil-fuel generated electricity and renewables.The report authors caution that because of the confidentiality and range of energy contracts, precise figures on profit margins in the electricity market can't be calculated from the market data and estimates are based on representative average contract structures. However, because these renewables didn't experience significant increases in production costs during this time, much of their additional revenues likely translated to much wider profit margins.These increased profits prompted the Government to introduce the Electricity Generator Levy starting on 1 January 2023, sometimes referred to as a \"windfall tax.\" Had the levy been in place during 2022, it would have reduced revenues to renewable generators by about 12% to 15%, though that likely would not have lowered costs for consumers unless that captured revenue were used as a direct subsidy for consumers.While much of the increasing price of gas-generated electricity was caused by the rising wholesale cost of natural gas, the report provides evidence that gas producers increased their profit margins as well. By analyzing the \"spark spread,\" a published direct measure of the margins earned by gas generators, and other indicators, the researchers conclude that producers raised the price of electricity significantly more than the increased cost of their gas inputs.Various changes since 2020 that limited Britain's ability to access lower-cost electricity from mainland Europe contributed to making this possible. The volatility in markets, construction hurdles and long lead times means that there is little price competition between gas and renewable generation, so high gas prices do little to stimulate additional, timely renewables investment.The new report builds on previous work released last year analyzing how natural gas costs set the price for electricity in the UK, despite cheaper renewables producing much of the country's power.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the French Education Minister?",
  "answer_squad": " Pap Ndiaye",
  "text": "Recently, the French Education Minister, Pap Ndiaye, announced a potential education reform that would require private schools to diversify their student population to maintain their public subsidies from the State. Although this state intervention into private education is somewhat unusual, Ndiaye argues that public schools alone cannot achieve diversity. Similarly, India's Right to Education Act imposed a 25% quota on all private schools for students from disadvantaged schools, creating the largest affirmative action policy in the world in 2009.          Abhijeet Singh and Mauricio Romero analyzed the effect of this policy introduction in Chhattisgarh, a state with a population of approximately 29 million people, using a lottery-based allocation of oversubscribed slots in private schools. They found that lottery applicants were generally more educated and better off than eligible caste groups and the overall population in the state.Additionally, the authors showed that most individuals who did not receive a seat in a private school through the lottery still attended a private school (if not the same school), indicating that the policy's effects were limited and casting doubt on its relevance.Interestingly, the authors discovered that lower application rates from poorer students did not stem from a lack of interest in private education. Poorer households placed equal value on these schools, but faced stronger information constraints and barriers to applying, including factors such as lack of awareness about the policy, lack of internet access at home, and limited familiarity with online application portals.The paper's most important conclusion, with broader implications for policy design in general, is that the policy lifted only one barrier (financial) out of many (including informational hurdles) faced by poorer households when sending their children to school. Therefore, to achieve the desired outcomes, all barriers must be lifted simultaneously. These findings underscore the importance of conducting thorough policy assessments and designing comprehensive solutions when implementing large-scale policies.The research is available as a working paper through the RISE Working Paper Series.

  "answer_squad": " Alternative Influence Network",
  "text": "Anti-LGBTQ+ hate from religious conservatives and far-right extremists in the United States, and now in Australia, is a worrying trend.          It was shocking to see video of an attack on a peaceful LGBTQ+ protest outside a church in southwest Sydney where Mark Latham was speaking in the lead-up to the 2023 New South Wales election. Out gay politician Alex Greenwich has brought a defamation suit against Latham over an offensive homophobic tweet.There are reports of increases in homophobic abuse and assaults on Sydney's Oxford Street. Drag queen storytime events have been targeted in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Last week, local councils in Victoria canceled several events following threats from far-right activists.These developments suggest that bigotry needs only to find the right conditions to turn into violence, and that the stigma against same-sex attraction and related gender identities can be invoked long after decriminalization and de-pathologization.This wave of anti-LGBTQ+ hate has its cultural and technological origins in the US, where religious affiliation is higher than in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, England and Wales. Baseless claims that male same-sex attraction and drag performance are threats to children have more political traction in the US, as a wave of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation there shows.Yet the issues remain a concern in any jurisdiction where US news media has audiences and digital platforms operate.Commercializing hate and emboldening extremistsMy research in Representation, Resistance and the Digiqueer: Fighting for Recognition in Technocratic Times has examined the growth of far-right opposition to LGBTQ+ expression in Australia and the US in recent years. This extremism has been driven by a confluence of religion, nationalism, technology, commercialization and sexual politics.Notions of \"sexual purity\", linked to nationhood by religious groups and far-right extremists, are circulated via the \"manosphere\": an overlapping group of websites, online forums and blogs that promote masculinity and misogyny.The Center for Countering Digital Hate estimates that anti-LGBTQ+ extremists are picking up followers at quadruple the rate since Elon Musk acquired Twitter.Twitter and Facebook comprehensively failed to enforce community standards amid a surge in hateful online anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric triggered by Florida's \"Don't Say Gay or Trans\" Bill.Anti-LGBTQ+ \"grooming\" rhetoric went viral on Twitter after the Colorado Springs shooting in November last year. Meta, which owns Facebook, has profited from advertisements directing child \"grooming\" rhetoric against the LGBTQ+ community and its allies. At least 59 advertisements promoting that rhetoric were served to users more than 2.1 million times.The monetizing of hate through YouTube includes the sale of mundane items such as sweatshirts and mugs adorned with homophobic slurs. YouTube profited from the vilification of gay journalist Carlos Maza by far-right YouTuber Steven Crowder, until the site eventually demonetised Crowder's account.Crowder is part of an assortment of scholars, media pundits and internet celebrities that has been termed the Alternative Influence Network. This network seeks to radicalize through social networking practices, promoting political ideologies on YouTube that range from mainstream versions of libertarianism and conservatism to overt white nationalism.This agenda has been amplified through inadequate moderation of online hate by digital platforms, opportunistic politicians, and commercial exploitation of anti-LGBTQ+ hate by the \"angertainment\" industry\u2014programming characterized by anger, or which provokes anger in its audience.The latest annual European Union review of online platforms' compliance with the EU's code of disinformation bears this out. TikTok is the only platform to have improved on the timely removal of hate speech.      Political permissiveness and the 'Trump effect'The polarization of editorial positions within traditional news media has, at the same time, encouraged the online growth of partisan agendas. Polarisng misinformation can be a revenue generator. It can also undermine confidence in democratic elections and propagate climate denialism, feeding the misinformation and disinformation ecosystem.This has occurred within a broader context of misinformation driven by domestic politicians and permissiveness by digital platforms towards hateful conduct.It is in this context of ambiguity and baseless claims that hate against LGBTQ+ individuals and communities has thrived, under the auspices of a \"freedom of speech\" that does not strike a reasonable balance between expression and dignity.Conservative Christian and far-right movements have sought to capitalize on the so-called \"Trump effect\". This refers to the theory that the divisive rhetoric used by Donald Trump emboldens perpetrators of hate, thereby creating even more hate.According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, groups that vilify the LGBTQ+ community represented the fastest-growing sector among hate groups in 2019, expanding from 49 in 2018 to 70 in 2019\u2014a nearly 43% increase.The US Capitol riot in January 2021 became a recruitment drive for some extremist groups. The anti-LGBTQ+ group the Proud Boys grew from 43 chapters in 2020 to 72 in 2022.Visibility as a double-edged swordThe increase in hate is occurring in a period when more and more people are identifying as something other than heterosexual.In Australia, an estimated 11% of the population have a diverse sexual orientation or gender identity.In the US, 7.1% of the adult population identify as one of these non-heterosexual identities, double the percentage from 2012. According to the same survey, roughly 20.8% of Generation Z (born between 1997 and 2003) and 10.5% of Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) in the US identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual and/or transgender.This visibility has become a double-edged sword. Communities have gained recognition through identity politics, but their visibility makes them a potential target for violence. Bigots know this, and that is why they often personalize their slurs.At the same time, the rise of anti-LGBTQ+ hate has occurred despite\u2014and likely as a consequence of\u2014the decriminalization of same-sex conduct in a growing number of jurisdictions, the expansion of legitimate categories of vulnerability enshrined in anti-discrimination law, and progress made on marriage equality.The contradictory nature of the current hybrid ecosystem of old and new media illustrates this point. The rise of social media has created an environment in which there has never been greater opportunity for the diverse expression of sexual orientation and gender. At the same time, engaging in that expression means navigating the potential violence of the online world, and its manifestations in interpersonal violence.Addressing the hate feedback loopWhat needs to be done to address the hate feedback loop? For a start, conservative groups that might have perceived themselves as the legitimate definers of state policy need to engage in challenging debates without resorting to hateful conduct.Digital platforms also need to address online hate in a timely manner and their responses need to be coordinated across platforms. Transparency is needed to expose algorithmic decision-making processes that might perpetuate bias.A better balance between fact-based reporting and opinion, and an emphasis on evidence-based reasoning, would also go some way to addressing unqualified freedom of speech claims.At the same time, we need election campaigns that resonate with constituents' lived experiences, not ones that resort to divisive political messaging. This has been evident in some recent elections in Australia, notably the 2018 state election in Victoria.From a legal perspective, it is necessary to consider whether anti-vilification and incitement to violence legislation adequately addresses the broadening of non-heterosexual identification.There are, for example, calls to reform anti-vilification legislation in Victoria. Exemptions from anti-discrimination laws that protect LGBTQ+ people from service and employment discrimination are the focus of the Australian Law Reform Commission's inquiry into exceptions for religious schools. Growing calls to revise Australia's privacy legislation need to be heeded.The origins of the anti-LGBTQ+ hate feedback loop are complex. But they are not insurmountable. Not addressing them will leave a growing number of people susceptible to violence, which diminishes us all.

  "text": "A single, 10-minute meeting between teachers and their principals can increase teacher job satisfaction, our new research shows. This increase in job satisfaction could potentially encourage teachers to stay in the profession longer, thereby reducing turnover and potentially saving school districts hundreds of thousands of dollars.          Our pilot study findings were published in the Journal of Leadership, Equity, and Research.By combining surveys and digital conferencing to gauge how teachers felt before and after they met with their principals, we implemented a novel research design that, to the best of our knowledge, has never been attempted previously. The three teachers who had the meetings were compared to four teachers who did not meet with their principals.Although there are many factors, such as relatively low salaries and lack of support from colleagues, that contribute to teacher turnover, teachers also frequently mention inadequate support from school principals as a major reason for leaving the profession. Due to increasing demands on school administrators' time, a commitment of only 10 minutes could have a lot of appeal if later on, that 10 minutes can save countless hours that would otherwise be spent on attracting and hiring new teachers to replace the ones that leave.Half of U.S. teachers leave the profession within their first five years on the job. These early departures occur most often in schools located in poorer, rural and inner-city areas.Very often these schools have higher percentages of students who require remedial or specialized learning environments. In terms of subject matter, many schools are struggling to find qualified math and science teachers, as well as teachers who are certified to teach English language learners.Studies have also shown that many schools with lower student achievement have disproportionately high numbers of inexperienced teachers.While our study involved 10-minute meetings, we recognize that school principals need to do more than just hold these meetings to ensure they are supporting their teachers effectively. Recent research has shown that COVID-19 led to lower job satisfaction among teachers, placing greater demands on school principals to support their teachers.Depending on the location, the cost of replacing each teacher is between US$10,000 and $20,000. Taken nationally, these costs amount to $7.3 billion annually that could be spent on facilities, programs, meals and supplies to directly assist students.We are making plans to expand this intervention research to include a much larger population of teachers\u2014500 from one state, to be exact\u2014and administrators.We also plan to investigate the role that social media plays in how the general public, and specifically aspiring teachers, view the teaching profession. Thirty years ago, burned-out teachers were limited in expressing their workplace challenges to friends, family and others in their local communities. With the advent of social media, however, they are able to broadcast these struggles to anyone with internet access, across the country and around the world.Determining the factors that contribute to the number of teachers who enter the profession is also just as important as keeping teachers in their classrooms longer.

To more fully understand how COVID-19 affected the racial dynamics experienced by Asian professionals in the workplace, McGill University medical student Zhida Shang teamed up with Jennifer Kim, an assistant professor at Tufts University School of Medicine, to interview and gather stories over the span of three months from 35 Asian Americans or Asian Canadian professionals working in a range of different industries. These included finance, health care, technology, and higher education.       The study, \"No, I Do Belong: How Asian American and Asian Canadian Professionals Defy and Counter Workplace Racial Violence during COVID-19,\" by Zhida Shang and Jennifer Y. Kim was published in the Journal of Management Studies.The researchers uncovered several important findings about how racism against Asians can manifest at work and how Asians are responding to these forms of discrimination. They found that racial discrimination against Asians surfaced both in blatant and subtle comments and in behaviors in four different ways: portrayal of Asians as a yellow peril, microaggressions that amplified group differences, portrayal of all Asians as a monolithic group, and denial of their experience dealing with racism. The researchers say these findings highlight the imperative for leaders to help repair cross-racial relationships and create an organizational culture that is inclusive for all.

  "text": "A trio of economists and social scientists from Zayed University, Utrecht University and TU Dresden has found via survey analysis that conservative people are more likely to share fake news but most believe such stories to be true. In their study, reported in the journal Scientific Reports, K. Peren Arin, Deni Mazrekaj and Marcel Thum conducted large-scale surveys in the U.K. and Germany regarding fake news.          With the advent of the internet, sharing of information by non-news organizations has proliferated to the extent that individuals can now reach an audience of millions. And unfortunately, not all such information is true. People can post fabricated stories or pass on information they have learned from others without verifying its accuracy. This has given rise to an age of fake news.This new class of news, it has been noted, can be classified into two major categories: disinformation, which is intentionally deceptive, or misinformation, in which the sharer believes the false news to be true. In this new effort, the researchers wondered if people who spread fake news do so with the intent to deceive or if they pass on news because they believe it to be true.To find out, they carried out a large-scale survey effort in both the U.K. and Germany asking respondents about their ability to detect fake news, their political leanings, and their motivations for sharing news. In all, 2,400 surveys were returned and studied.The researchers verified previous findings\u2014fake news is more often shared by people with conservative backgrounds. But they also found that most of them are not trying to convince others of things they know are false\u2014most believe the fake news they are spreading is true.The research team also found that older people were more likely to spot fake news than younger people, as were those with higher incomes and those who were more highly educated. They also found that younger people were more likely to spread disinformation. The researchers suggest that the root cause of sharing of fake news is a lack of education and critical thinking skills.

The pair, believed to be two males aged at least 55, were found in recent excavations at Pompeii's \"Chaste Lovers\" block of buildings.They are believed to have been killed as an earthquake knocked down a wall in the room where they sought shelter. One of the skeletons had an arm raised as if in defense.The earthquake struck as the huge blast from nearby Mount Vesuvius covered the city of Pompeii with thick volcanic ash, preserving the bodies of many of its residents.To date, the remains of more than 1,000 people have been uncovered throughout the sprawling site, most recently in November 2020 when archaeologists unearthed two bodies, believed to be a young enslaved person and his possible owner.The two newly discovered victims announced Tuesday \"probably died due to multiple traumas caused by the collapse of part of the building\", the Pompeii archaeological park said in a statement.They were found in what is believed to be a storeroom inside the \"Chaste Lovers\" block, where colorful frescoes and the skeletons of mules who worked the millstones for grain have been uncovered in the past.                The recently found skeletons are likely of middle-aged males.             The skeletons were found lying on their side with their legs curled up, and one wore a ring on his left hand.Archaeologists estimate that 15 to 20 percent of Pompeii's population died in the eruption, mostly from thermal shock as a giant cloud of gases and ash covered the city.Protecting himselfEarthquakes before and during the eruption, as documented in letters by Roman author Pliny the Younger, also took their toll.                Earthquakes before and during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius also took their toll.             \"Among the causes of death, the collapse of buildings, in some cases due to earthquakes that accompanied the eruption, proved to be a lethal threat,\" the park said.Pompeii's director, Gabriel Zuchtriegel, said modern technology was helping archaeologists \"better understand the hell that completely destroyed the city of Pompeii in two days, killing many inhabitants: children, women and men\".                An amphora and a collection of jugs and vases were found inside the room with the victims.             Traces of what is believed to be a cloth bundle were found next to one of the victims, containing necklace beads and coins.Inside the room was an amphora and a collection of bowls and jugs, while an adjacent room contained a home shrine in the form of a fresco, and a narrow bathroom with a toilet.In the room where the men were found, part of a wall had collapsed, hitting one of the victims \"whose raised arm perhaps refers to the tragic image of a vain attempt to protect himself from falling masonry\", the park said.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Two new skeletons found at Pompeii excavations (2023, May 16)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-skeletons-pompeii-excavations.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Lining the Cape of South Africa and its southern coast are long chains of caves that nearly 200,000 years ago were surrounded by a lush landscape and plentiful food.          During a glacial phase that lasted between 195,000 to 123,000 years ago, these caves served as refuge to a group of humans that some researchers think were the only people to survive this ice age, called Marine Isotope Stage Six, or MIS6. And in this coastal region, a lot of archaeological research has taken place. Of less interest to archaeologists has been the interior of South Africa, which was thought to be an uninhabited, inhospitable place during at least two waves of ice ages, MIS3 and 2.Now, a study has shown that the region might have been more fertile and temperate during these two glacial periods than previously thought, and that the region likely played host to human populations living around a series of paleolakes. The study, led by University of Michigan archaeologist Brian Stewart, provides a more comprehensive timeline of the age and stages of these lakes, and shows human fingerprints across the region. The research is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\"There's this perennial assumption that human population centers were always along the coast and that the interior, especially the southern interior of the Karoo Desert, were largely depopulated for long stretches of time,\" Stewart said. \"The funny thing is that one just has to go into the interior and walk around and notice that there's archaeology everywhere.\"But to flag the region as worthy of archaeological attention, the researchers needed to show that humans could have actually lived there. The research team, an international group including researchers from South Africa, the United Kingdom and France, examined a series of super flat areas of land ringed by higher ground. They showed that these regions, called \"pans\" in Afrikaans, are ancient lake beds, while the areas of higher elevation that encircle them are erosional landforms and sedimentary deposits left over from their ancient shorelines.This suggests that these time periods were not as dry in this region as previously thought: there would have needed to have been sustained rainfall and humidity to keep these lakes full. The more temperate climate required to sustain lakes also meant the landscape was also able to sustain both vegetation and animals required to support human populations.      Reconstructing the paleolakesThe researchers used a variety of technologies to date and reconstruct these ancient lakes, shorelines and lake bottom deposits, and to recreate the landscape of the region.These include radiocarbon dating and a technique called luminescence, which measures the radioactivity of tiny crystals of quartz or feldspar that haven't seen the light of day since they were covered by sediment tens of thousands of years earlier. While buried, electrons from radioactive elements common to all sediments get trapped in these crystal matrices at a constant rate. By measuring how many electrons accumulated in the sample and comparing that to the degree of background radioactivity, the researchers can predict its age.The researchers used these techniques to date columns of sedimentary lakeshore and lake bottom deposits, called lacustrine deposits, found surrounding and within a series of three pans dotted across a region some 100,000 square miles, about the size of Texas. They also aged the shells of freshwater mollusks found scattered throughout the region and embedded within the sedimentary lake deposits.An aquatic gastropod, Tomichia ventricosa, found at a pan called Swartkolkvloer, was embedded in a column of lacustrine deposits. Together, the deposits and shells were radiocarbon dated to two time periods: approximately 39\u201355 thousand years before present, and approximately 31\u201334 thousand years before present.At another pan called Grootvloer, the researchers found a freshwater mollusk called Unio caffer, which required \"perennial freshwater\" and the presence of fish to reproduce. These shells and lacustrine deposits in this pan were dated to between approximately 20\u201322 thousand years before present.The researchers were also able to predict the area of land the lakes encompassed, as well as how deep they were, based on the height of the lacustrine deposits ringing their shorelines. For example, they determined that the paleolake at Swartkolkvloer was about 83 miles square and 59 feet deep, while the paleolake at Grootvloer was likely about 17 miles square and 62 feet deep. Another pan called Alexanderfontein, some 300 miles northeast near the town of Kimberley, held a lake about 13.5 miles square and 48 feet deep.Based on these parameters, the researchers knew the lakes would have required a climate drastically different from the one that exists in South Africa's interior today. Using a hydrological model, they determined that evaporation rates within the region were between 20% and 25% lower than what they are today, while precipitation would have been more than 200% higher at Swartkolkvloer and 88% higher at Alexanderfontein.\"In various parts of the interior, between about 60 to about 12,000 years ago, we can see that there were enduring phases of pretty large bodies of water kicking around what used to be thought of as an arid and inhospitable environment,\" Stewart said. \"This was a period that used to be thought of as notoriously dry and freezing cold in the winter. But we've got this evidence for these large lakes existing during this time period.\"The researchers say current day regions that have similar climates and rates of precipitation and evaporation are likely northern Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Based on this estimation and data found from a contemporaneous site called Equus Cave, the researchers think large grazing and browsing mammals would have thrived in this region.A complex, prehistoric peopleScattered alongside the lakes are human artifacts such as triangular points, bladelets, weathered ostrich shells and other assemblages. Much of these are from the Middle Stone Age, which ranged from about 280,000 years ago to about 25,000 years ago, and the Later Stone Age, which lasted from 25,000 years ago right up to European contact in the 15th century.\"There's Middle Stone Age archaeology just everywhere,\" Stewart said. \"You can't drive anywhere and open the car door and not step on it. It's astounding how much there is.\"Stewart says their findings could also expand the region where archaeologists think humans became more behaviorally complex. Over the past decades, researchers have found evidence that humans living in coastal South Africa started making the leap into complex thought, showing some of the earliest signs of behavioral complexity. It was thought that both climate and nutrient stability\u2014including the rich omega fatty acids gleaned from seafood\u2014allowed humans here to become behaviorally modern.The group's work may challenge this idea by suggesting that favorable conditions for hunter-gatherers were not confined to the coastline but probably characterized many regions as climates changed, including the interior, current-day desert.\"Ours is a basin-wide study with much more macro scale implications. It also involves some of these areas that are just inland of this coastal and mountain belt that's dominated the archaeological narratives for so long,\" Stewart said. \"Just inland of this area is a region that has been, for a long time, portrayed as hostile, and it just simply appears not to have been the case for big chunks of time\u2014with the caveat that we need information on temperature depressions to understand how humans dealt with that.\"Stewart says next steps will be to return to the pans to study the archaeology throughout the region to understand better how humans lived in the area.

  "text": "It's a well-known truism in the world of park management: Hikers rarely read trailhead signs.          And in their zeal to enjoy the wilderness\u2014now\u2014they miss important messages posted to protect parks, wildlife and the hikers themselves.\"Since the 1960s, we've been doing studies on how we message to visitors and change people's behaviors,\" said Will Rice, an assistant professor of outdoor recreation and wildland management at the University of Montana. \"That's more than five decades we've been thinking about the words, but we've done little to date to test the graphic design of the signs.\"Figuring there must be a better way to grab attention, Rice reached out last year to University of Kansas Associate Professor of Design Jeremy Shellhorn, who founded the Design Outside Studio, a summer class for design students to tackle projects that benefit the public.Shellhorn also created a type font called National Park Typeface, which is becoming, as Rice puts, \"insanely popular.\"After a brainstorming session or two, Rice and Shellhorn assembled a team of undergraduate student researchers to determine what it takes\u2014visually and verbally\u2014to reach even the most single-minded hikers. Through their coursework, KU's students designed the graphics based on messaging crafted by UM's students, who also conducted field research to determine if their efforts resonated with the hiking-boots crowd.For funding and help with the project, Rice turned to Missoula Parks & Recreation representatives, who asked students to address two very real management needs: keeping dogs on leash 200 meters from trailheads, and stopping the spread of invasive plant species by using boot brushes at trailheads.\"Parks & Recreation told the students they wanted positive messaging that invoked stewardship of this place,\" Rice said. \"We wanted to see if different graphic treatments would not only capture people's attention but also influence their behaviors and get them to buy into what we are trying to do.\"The students collaborated for weeks over the design, meeting online and sharing opinions on typefaces and colors through a messaging platform.                The designs that garnered the most interest, according to the data gathered by students, were those that featured something called \u201ctypography as image,\u201d a visual treatment intertwining images with the messaging. Credit: University of Montana/University of Kansas             \"It was interesting the way we interacted over Zoom,\" said Jazzelle Elias, who graduated this spring with a degree in parks, tourism and recreation management at UM. \"The KU students talked in media arts, we talked in social science. They were cool.\"Grace Walhus, another senior in PTRM, said working with the Kansas students was a unique experience, as was conducting field research once the signs were completed in the summer of 2022. The lab for their experiments was the Sunlight Trailhead in Missoula.\"It was the first time for me to do research out in the field,\" said Walhus, who also graduated in May and is working in Missoula taking care of campgrounds and trailheads for the U.S. Forest Service. \"It was interesting to see how extensive it was.\"Walhus and Elias said the big challenge was trying to remain as unobtrusive as possible as hikers interacted\u2014or not\u2014with the signs, while recording which signs drew the most attention and how much time hikers invested in reading the messaging. Sitting in camp chairs, pretending to picnic, was involved.\"Will told us we would be collecting data using the 'lurking method,' which everyone was super stoked about,\" said Elias, who will work this summer \"clearing trails and running chainsaws\" for the U.S. Forest Service in the Lincoln Ranger District.\"The most memorable reaction I saw was a hiker who not only wiped his boots on the boot brush, he wiped his dog's paws too,\" she added.The designs that garnered the most interest, according to the data gathered by students, were those that featured something called \"typography as image,\" a visual treatment intertwining images with the messaging. In one case, it was plants blooming in the North Hills of Missoula intertwined with typeface. In another, it was a dog leash, with collar.\"All the signs were way more enticing than a white sheet of paper stabled to tree,\" Rice said. \"They were really beautiful.\"They were also effective, said Walhus.                The designs that garnered the most interest, according to the data gathered by students, were those that featured something called \u201ctypography as image,\u201d a visual treatment intertwining images with the messaging. Credit: University of Montana/University of Kansas             \"Our research showed that messages and graphics really do influence people\" she said.Missoula Parks & Recreation will use the results of the study as it develops new signage, Rice said. Meanwhile he'll conduct a similar study this summer in the Grand Canyon, testing signage to stop people from peering too far over the canyon's crumbling rim.\"The wording does depend on the audience,\" Rice said. \"The Grand Canyon has a much more diverse audience than hikers in Montana. So that will be an interesting challenge.\"The results of the first study will be published in June's issue of the Journal of Outdoor Recreation and Tourism. It's also been posted online since earlier this year.All of the students in the study were listed as authors\u2014a rarity in academia, Rice said.\"In the past it was unheard of for undergraduate students to be listed as authors even though they often put in a ton of the work,\" he said. \"But in recent years there has been a really big push to recognize their efforts, and it's awesome that their names are there.\"Sharing authorship is definitely a lasting legacy for students in the class, Elias said.\"I remember thinking, wow, I'm published now,\" she said. \"My partner and his family were so excited they made me a cake to celebrate.\" More information:William L.

  "text": "Post-secondary education (PSE) has a potential for improving the IQ of adults with mild intellectual disability (ID), according to a new Bar-Ilan University study.          The study examined the impact of PSE on students with mild ID who study in a university-based program, known as the Empowerment Project, at the Bar-Ilan University Faculty of Education.The study sample included 24 participants, divided into 12 students with ID who participate in the Empowerment Project and 12 adults with ID with the same background, who did not participate. The results were published in the European Journal of Special Needs Education.The findings revealed significant IQ improvement among the 12 adults after four-and-a-half years of participation in PSE compared to those with the same intelligence level and lifestyle who did not participate in PSE. Their IQ remained stable.The Empowerment Project, a first-of its-kind program established by Prof. Hefziba Lifshitz, is based on her Compensation Age Theory, which postulates that chronological age, as opposed to mental age, plays an important role in determining the cognitive ability of adults with intellectual disability.Lifshitz and colleagues at Bar-Ilan University have determined that intelligence in ID individuals reaches its peak at around 40-45 years old, providing a window of opportunity for additional, meaningful education and enabling ID adults to develop and maximize their potential later in life.The Empowerment Project serves 120 adults with all levels of intellectual disability: mild-moderate as well as severe-profound, providing college-level courses adapted to their needs. The most academically capable students in the program can earn a bachelor's degree. All 12 students participating in this study began their studies in the 2014-2015 academic year.The Weschler Adult Intelligence Test was administered during the third year of study. A second test was administered four-and-a-half years later. \"We know that our project contributes to the improvement of cognitive ability, but I was curious to examine whether it would influence their intelligence,\" says Prof. Lifshitz. \"Among those students studying for a BA, IQ recorded the second time exceeded the cutoff point of the ID definition, which is between 70-75. They reached 80, and some higher. This is an amazing development.\"Though some more and some less, IQ increased in all of the PSE participants, according to Lifshitz, who conducted the study with Dr. Shoshana Nissim, Dr. Chaya Aminadav, and Prof. Eli Vakil from Bar-Ilan University.The Empowerment Project is the first in the world to open adapted enrichment college for students with severe-profound ID who require extensive support. Due to physical handicap they cannot attend university in person, so the Project offers courses on-site in their day care centers.Next month, six of the 120 will become the first group of adults with ID in Israel to fulfill all the academic requirements for a bachelor's degree. It is believed that only three additional ID individuals in the world have received the same degree to date.Prof. Lifshitz says that in addition to their IQ improvement, their self-esteem is also much higher. This can be seen in how they carry themselves and in their body language. And on the university campus they feel like insiders rather than outsiders.

  "text": "Investors in commercial real estate are rethinking the values of coastal properties exposed to flood risk\u2014even in northern U.S. locales that haven't suffered flood damage, according to researchers. This shift in perspective has implications for investors and developers alike as they determine the value of coastal properties amid a changing climate.          Eva Steiner, associate professor of real estate and King Family Early Career Professor in Real Estate in the Penn State Smeal College of Business, and her co-authors published these findings recently in Real Estate Economics.Steiner and her colleagues, motivated by the observation that commercial real estate investors and developers are increasingly worried about environmental risk exposures of assets tied to particular locations, set out to study how professional investors capitalized flood risk in commercial real estate markets after 2012's Hurricane Sandy. They looked at transaction prices of properties with varying degrees of flood risk exposure both before and after this major flood event.The researchers found, not surprisingly, that New York commercial real estate properties in areas that sustained hurricane damage continued to trade at lower values in the years following Hurricane Sandy.\"Of course there's going to be a negative effect,\" Steiner said. \"A lot of buildings were damaged, and in many cases tenants couldn't occupy the buildings for a while so owners lost rental income. But the more interesting question that we were after is this: If you put those immediate damages aside, did this event trigger a shift in how investors think about risks associated with coastal properties?\"That question led them to look at commercial real estate transactions after Hurricane Sandy in Boston as well as New York. Although Boston didn't sustain damage from Sandy, it is a location along the Eastern Seaboard that's considered at risk of flooding in the future. The researchers found a similar pattern of commercial properties in Boston trading at lower values\u2014an effect that can't be attributed to actual damaged property and is likely because of changes in investors' perceptions of flood risks, they said.To strengthen this conclusion, Steiner and her colleagues conducted a placebo test, looking at commercial properties along Lake Michigan in Chicago.\"We wanted to make sure there wasn't something else about waterfront property that changed how investors feel about these properties,\" Steiner said. \"Here, there is zero hurricane risk because it's an inland body of water. We found no pricing effects in this area, so based on the knowledge we have, the effects we see in New York and Boston are likely due to professional investors responding to a persistent shift in perceptions of flood risk post-Sandy, even in locations spared by the disaster.\"      To conduct their study, the researchers used data that spanned about 10 years before Hurricane Sandy and five years after.\"Ideally, we would look at two properties, one coastal and one farther inland, that each traded before and after Sandy,\" Steiner said. \"And we would want to see the price of the exposed property go down after Sandy relative to the price of the non-exposed property.\"But because commercial real estate doesn't trade very frequently, they matched properties that were similar based on observable characteristics.Steiner and her co-authors chose to focus on commercial real estate because it provides a clearer, more objective picture than residential real estate.\"When you buy a home, it's not just an investment,\" she said. \"There is a consumption value\u2014you are going to live in that home, and that may include an element of sentiment as well. And those factors may make you evaluate property risks a little differently from an investor who is just looking at this as a financial proposition, an economic calculation.\"The research results can help inform decisions of both developers and investors as flood risks for coastal properties continue to increase, according to the research team. Developers' decisions about where to create new real estate assets will be affected by investors who are unwilling to pay top prices for properties that are at risk of flooding. Investors who currently hold properties that may be subject to flood risk can get a better assessment of the potential risks to the values of the assets they have in their portfolios.\"What do we do with those assets that we now know are exposed to these flood risks?\" Steiner asked. \"There may come a point when these assets will no longer hold much economic value, and these properties may be abandoned, or they may need significant retrofitting to make them more resilient.\" More information:Jawad M.

  "answer_squad": " Blueberries, butter and vegetable oil",
  "text": "German consumers consider paper-based packaging to be particularly environmentally friendly. Nevertheless, they tend to be skeptical about innovative products such as paper-based bottles. This is shown by a recent study by the University of Bonn and Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich. Almost 3,000 women and men from all over Germany were surveyed for the study. The results have now been published in the journal Food Quality and Preference.          Worldwide, almost 400 million tons of plastic are produced annually\u2014all of the cars in Europe together weigh only slightly more. According to estimates, 40 percent of plastics are processed into packaging: for refrigerators, books, deodorants, but also for drinks or cucumbers. A large part of this later ends up in the garbage or in the environment. At the same time, production wastes valuable fossil resources and endangers the climate.\"One possible solution to these problems is environmentally friendly plastic alternatives,\" explains Janine Macht, a doctoral student at the Institute for Food and Resource Economics at the University of Bonn. \"These include plastics made from renewable raw materials, such as agricultural waste. Some manufacturers also rely on innovative paper-based packaging such as ice cream cups or bottles. We wanted to know what level of acceptance these alternatives receive from consumers and to what extent this also depends on the product that is packaged.\"Macht investigated these aspects together with her colleague Jeanette Klink-Lehmann and project coordinator Dr. Sandra Venghaus from Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich (Venghaus has since moved to a junior professorship at RWTH Aachen University). The researchers conducted an online survey with nearly 3,000 male and female participants from across Germany. The sample was chosen to be as similar as possible to the distribution in the general population in terms of gender, age distribution, and education.The researchers focused their survey on three very different foods: Blueberries, butter and vegetable oil. In addition, there were three different ways in which these products were packaged: in a traditional (but at least recyclable) plastic container, in a bioplastic container, or in a paper-based alternative. There were therefore nine different food-packaging combinations in total.      Respondents were now randomly divided into nine groups. Each of the groups was shown a photo of one of these combinations, along with brief information about the packaging. The subjects were then asked to indicate how environmentally friendly they thought this packaging shown was. They were also asked how suitable they thought the packaging was for protecting, transporting and storing the food in question.A key finding: Paper-based packaging received significantly better environmental scores on average than packaging made from bioplastics. Conventional plastic packaging scored worst on this point. However, respondents were suspicious about the practicality of the paper containers. They did consider them quite suitable for protecting soft fruit such as berries from damage during transport. As storage containers for vegetable oil, on the other hand, they saw plastic containers clearly in the lead. In fact, conventional plastics scored best here.Participants were also asked to indicate whether they would buy the product in the packaging shown. According to the study, significantly more people would pick berries in a cardboard container than in a plastic basket. Vegetable oil, on the other hand, was most attractive for purchase when it was filled in a bottle made of bioplastic. \"So when it comes to making a purchasing decision, customers don't just look at the presumed environmental friendliness, but also at how suitable they think the packaging is for the food in question,\" says Macht.Incidentally, the study says nothing about how sustainable bioplastics or cardboard bottles really are. \"In some cases, there isn't even any data on the new packaging yet,\" explains Macht, who is also a member of the Transdisciplinary Research Area \"Sustainable Futures\" at the University of Bonn.In any case, she adds, it was difficult to make a general assessment of the eco-balance. Whether plastic made from renewable raw materials, for example, is really sustainable depends on many factors: Where the source materials come from. Whether valuable agricultural land was sacrificed for production, which may then lead to more forests being cleared. How well compostable and recyclable the plastic is.It is a similar story with paper-based packaging: Its production also consumes resources and energy\u2014sometimes more, sometimes less, depending on the production location and method. \"In principle, it's certainly best to avoid packaging as much as possible,\" the researcher emphasizes. \"But that doesn't always work. Liquids need a container in which to be stored. Fruits such as raspberries would not survive transport to the retailer or even from the supermarket to home without protective packaging.\"Nevertheless, she is convinced that solutions made from renewable raw materials can be a first step toward solving at least some problems, such as the consumption of precious fossil resources or\u2014in the case of compostable packaging\u2014the huge amounts of waste that will pollute our oceans for centuries to come.

In a circular economy, resources are used more efficiently, waste is minimized, and materials are recycled or repurposed, creating a closed-loop system where materials and products are constantly reused or regenerated.          One trend that goes around in this economic circle is the emergence of peer-to-peer (P2P) online platforms that connect people with something to sell or donate to people who need or want a given product. Within this, we also see the upcycling or repurposing of old products for sale to others.Research in the International Journal of Export Marketing, has looked at why people resell second-hand products on such online platforms. The study, by Saleem Ur Rahman and Hannu Makkonen of the School of Marketing and Communication at the University of Vaasa in Finland, collected and analyzed data from more than 3,000 people in Finland. The team found that there are various disparate reasons why people choose to resell items they no longer need on these platforms. Some simply want to make money, others do it for the fun of it, and yet others find it an engaging part of their being social. Interestingly, the study found that practical, generative, and protestor motives do not influence reselling behavior.The researchers suggest that these findings might help policymakers keen to improve society's green credentials, to understand how people use these platforms, and develop regulations to ensure consumer protection as well as to encourage this kind of circular economic activity with a view to reducing waste. The research also offers some insights for platform developers and operators who might now tailor specific services based on the motives of their users.Closing the loop on the circular economy could help us reduce waste and materials destined for simple recycling or, worse, landfill, create new economic opportunities, and promote sustainable use of resources.

  "answer_squad": " the mismatch between what employers want and what young people have",
  "text": "The fact that more than half of the South African population is under 30 years could be beneficial for the country's economic growth and development. But South Africa has not been able to reap this demographic dividend. This is largely due to a skills mismatch.          That's why 60% of its young people (between the ages of 15 and 25) are unemployed. The situation was made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic. Its impact on the labor market disproportionately affected young and low-skilled workers.A major cause of youth unemployment in South Africa is the mismatch between what employers want and what young people have. This is mostly characterized by technical under-skilling relative to the expectations of employers.The country's schooling system has failed young people, with many learners going through the basic education system without acquiring the necessary literacy and numeracy skills.In response to the unemployment crisis, the South African government established the National Rural Youth Service Corps program in September 2010, targeting young people in rural areas who are the most disadvantaged. It is still running today.The program's main objective was to equip participants with technical and vocational skills to enhance their employment prospects, or ability to create their own businesses. Participants receive a stipend during their two years of participation. They are also trained in leadership, networking, and problem-solving.We sought to assess the effectiveness of the program in bridging the skills mismatch. We also wanted to identify the skills most likely to be associated with labor market success.We used a blended methodological approach, combining quantitative and qualitative analyzes. This enabled us to capture the data on skills accumulation and the related labor market outcomes. It also provided us with the human narratives.Among participants who had jobs, we found that the key determinant of their success was the improvement in their soft skills, including problem-solving, networking and leadership skills. The same was true for the participants who had started businesses; soft skills proved significantly more effective than technical skills.These results highlight the critical role of soft skills, echoing a growing call in other countries for increased emphasis on soft-skills in employment support programs.Overall, despite some success in helping rural youth improve their technical and soft skills, the program has a number of weaknesses that limit its effectiveness in linking its graduates to stable employment or viable enterprise creation. These include insufficient support to program alumni after their exit, and a mismatch between acquired skills and what employers want.      Effectiveness and weaknesses of the programWe also examined the relevance, effectiveness, transformative effects, and equitable inclusiveness of the program. In addition, we looked at the behavior of the participants, including changes in attitudes, commitments and the social and cultural values of individuals and groups.Most of the participants as well as the program implementation officials we interviewed described the program as a relevant policy intervention to address the unemployment problem among rural youth.However, they said its implementation raised practical challenges for participants. One key weakness was the program's failure in supporting graduates to find stable employment. It is estimated that less than 10% of exited graduates benefit from such support.A major factor is that the administration of the program does not have sufficient human and financial resources to commit to post-graduation support. It also lacks adequate administrative structures to track graduates and provide them with the administrative and material resource assistance they need to secure employment.Similarly, program participants who start businesses are left without support. There's also a lack of business networks in rural areas. Networks often assist new start-ups to integrate in local value chains.In addition, the mismatch between the technical skills taught within the program and what employers require is a significant impediment to the success of graduates. This makes it difficult for graduates to find sustainable employment or create viable enterprises post-graduation.Most key informants\u2014those whose positions enabled them to have access to important information relevant to the interview topic\u2014were of the view that the skills and qualifications obtained from the program were inferior to those obtained from technical vocational education and training colleges. This is despite these colleges being deemed inadequate to the task of closing the technical skills gap.Where the program has been most successful has been in ensuring the participation of women. They make up more than half of its participants.Implications and recommendationsIt is therefore not surprising that programs like the National Rural Youth Service Corps have not had a noticeable impact on South Africa's youth unemployment crisis. To succeed, there must be greater synergy between various stakeholders involved in rural enterprise development and employment creation.There must also be an alignment of skills taught to learners and the needs of employers. Graduates must be assisted with relevant resources, especially land and start-up capital.In addition, support for graduates must be streamlined to ensure effective tracking of participants when they graduate and that their needs are assessed properly.Lastly, we cannot overemphasize the importance of soft skills to the success of youth in the job market\u2014they should form the core of any program for youth employment.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the short video released by Dove?",
  "answer_squad": " The \"Cost of Beauty\"",
  "text": "The \"Cost of Beauty,\" a short video recently released by global beauty brand Dove, highlights the damaging effects of social media on young women's body image and self esteem. It forms part of a wider campaign that raises awareness about the devastating effects of social media on young women's mental and physical health.          It is clear social media can negatively affect women's relationships with their bodies, but our recent research revealed a more complex and nuanced picture.More than a decade of research has shown that unrealistic beauty standards, the rise of \"fitspiration,\" body shaming and online gender-based violence, are having a significant impact on young women.That said, social media users are not naive about the toxic beauty ideals being promoted across digital platforms.Our research found that women were very aware of the risks and vulnerabilities associated with using social media. And women were developing habits and online communities to counter these negative elements.We focused on the emergence of \"#fitspo\" (short for \"fitspiration\") content\u2014think rippling six pack, sweaty sports bra, and smiling face mid-workout.Despite being seemingly health positive, one of the consequences of fitspiration is that women now experience pressures to be both thin and fit. Increasingly, many women and girls actively avoid these online spaces, while others find support, inspiration and even care in these online communities.Instagram's potential as a positive spaceIn our work with exercising women who use Instagram, we found many everyday examples of how they thoughtfully navigated online spaces to reduce risk and minimize harm to themselves and others.For instance, when confronted with unrealistic body standards, women were making active choices to strategically curate their social media worlds by blocking, unfollowing\u2014also known as \"pruning\"\u2014content they found unhealthy or unrelatable. They also increasingly blocked and reported followers who are offering unsolicited advice and negative or sexualized comments.To challenge the pressures enhanced images can bring, many women chose to represent their \"real,\" \"raw\" and imperfect bodies without editing out stretch marks or body fat. Some women promoted this practice by using hashtags such as #filterfreefriday or #noedit.Women also made choices about how they engaged with other bodies online. Body shaming is rife on social media. But in many exercising communities women avoided posting comments that could make other women feel self-conscious or negative about their bodies.Making comments about someone's image could be seen to contribute to body surveillance. So, participants in our research explained that they focused on how women were looking strong or confident, or celebrated their efforts and achievements in a sport. Knowing how it felt to have one's body judged online prompted women to avoid judging others.      The power of connectionSocial connection was also an important feature for women and girls using social media.We found that for many women, their motivations for sharing images of themselves online were not simply about \"showing off\" their bodies or promoting themselves. Instead, they were trying to build safe online communities to seek validation and support. Posting pictures of their unfiltered bodies pursuing their sport and fitness goals was one of the ways they built a collective online presence.Social media was also important for women to promote their offline communities, relationships and skills, not just how they looked. This was particularly important during the pandemic, with fitness professionals using digital technologies to support their movement communities during challenging times.Importantly, women from diverse social, cultural and religious backgrounds experienced both the same and different sets of risks (such as racist and sexist trolling or body shaming) when using social media.Scholars have identified the ways Muslim sportswomen have navigated such risks, carefully considering gender, religion and culture in managing their accounts, their audiences, and taking time to consider the types of images and text they share.Researchers in Turkey have also revealed the potential in such imagery for challenging racialised and patriarchal norms and expectations of women's bodies in sport and fitness.Minimizing the harm of social mediaWhether we intend it to or not, posting about our bodies online and in public makes us vulnerable.Our findings suggests that we need alternative ways of thinking about women and girls' social media usage, where the risks and vulnerabilities of social media use become the basis for a more nuanced way of understanding how participation on social media can affect our lives.Paying attention to women's efforts to minimize harm through their own everyday actions on social media is an important first step towards cultivating social media encounters that account for broader impacts of what we post, based on care, consideration and respect.

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the permanent visa that will allow refugees to return home?",
  "answer_squad": " Resolution of Status Visa",
  "text": "In February this year, the Albanese government announced that thousands of refugees living in Australia who were on Temporary Protection Visas (TPV) and Safe Haven Enterprise Visas (SHEV) would now be moved onto a permanent visa known as a Resolution of Status Visa (ROS).          When making the announcement, Immigration Minister Andrew Giles said this would end the limbo for refugees after they had \"endured ten years of uncertainty\".The change was welcomed by an estimated 20,000 refugees who can move to permanent visas. They are part of a larger group of around 31,000 asylum seekers who arrived in Australia by boat before January 2014. Known collectively as the \"legacy caseload\", their refugee status was subject to a \"fast track\" process.The trauma of uncertaintyThe minister's recognition of the impact of visa uncertainty resonates with recently published research we conducted with lawyers and migration agents who work with this group. They encountered clients in mental health crises, feeling marginalized, defeated and in some cases \"lethal hopelessness\".This research adds to existing evidence about the negative impact of temporary visas on the mental health of asylum seekers. The research goes further and found that years of delays and the process itself contributed to deteriorating mental health.This research reveals how the government can use a trauma-informed approach to end visa uncertainty and create a shared future.What is the new procedure for obtaining permanent residence? What are the options for those who do not have a TPV or a SHEV? How can the government end ongoing uncertainty for them?Resolution of Status VisasRefugees who currently hold TPVs and SHEVs will be eligible for a permanent Resolution of Status Visa.Processing is under way and as of late March 2023 100 visas have already been granted. The department predicts most of these visas will be granted within 12 months. Funding to provide legal assistance to refugees is a welcome step towards facilitating a sense of stability and predictability as they await a visa.Permanent visas will mean refugees can begin the process of family reunion after over a decade of separation. Last year, the government removed policy barriers that meant sponsors who arrived by boat were the lowest priority in the visas queue.However, processing delays, high visa charges and strict rules around which family can be sponsored to Australia will mean refugees will continue to face ongoing separation from their partners and children.      What happens to those who do not hold a TPV or SHEV?Giles has stated that the February 13 announcement \"includes a pathway for all those in the cohort who are ultimately found to be owed protection\".Statistics published by the department in February 2023 state there are 9,861 people who have been through the fast-track process and were refused visas. Around 5,000 of those are challenging those refusals in the courts. If successful, their cases will be re-examined by the Immigration Assessment Authority (IAA). If they are then found to be a refugee, they would be eligible for a Resolution of Status Visa.Others may seek ministerial intervention. In late 2021, almost 200 people from Afghanistan were waiting for the minister to use his personal discretion to allow them to reapply for protection based on the Taliban takeover in 2021.The minister also has the discretion to grant visas to individuals who may not meet refugee criteria, but may have Australian citizen partners, children or employers\u2014as already done in the case of the Nadesalingham family.Flaws in the fast-track process and in particular with the review process of the IAA have been documented previously. Dismantling the \"fast track\" system was part of the Labor Party platform. But, to date, no announcements have been made and the IAA continues to hear cases.Reform may come as part of the upcoming overhaul of the administrative review system. What changes, if any, might be made are unclear, but this group of people face ongoing limbo.Deterioration in mental health is directly linked to treatmentWhile the minister has declared there is a pathway for all those who are found to be owed protection, there continues to be doubt about what will happen to those whose cases have been refused.In 2018 and 2019, we surveyed and interviewed lawyers and migration agents who worked directly with clients going through the \"fast track\" assessment process. They heard stories of overwhelming emotions (for example, despair and anger) as well as witnessing self-harm and suicidal behavior.A key driver of people's mental distress was their inability to apply for a visa for several years. This was followed by a difficult and fast-paced application process in which they were expected to relay their stories of persecution. Many individuals were distressed and destabilized before the process began.Legal professionals described clients feeling trapped by ongoing visa insecurity and having no control over their future. Family separation combined with uncertainty about their future undermined individuals' capacity to cope with everyday life and decision-making.These findings have significant practical implications for how the government handles law reform and policy development with this group. For those who have now found permanency, uncertainty around family reunification will continue to be a significant stressor. There are options to amend laws, policies and processes, which would make them more humane.Clarity and trauma-informed approaches are essential. For those who do not hold a TPV or SHEV, the Australian government should urgently collaborate with community groups, mental health experts and legal providers to co-design pathways and communication on how their cases will be reviewed and progressed.A recent High Court decision relating to how the minister's intervention powers have been exercised will force a review.The government has an opportunity to amend the guidelines and provide clear guidance for this group, which will allow those who were refused under the \"fast track\" system to be considered for visas that provide a pathway to certainty.

  "text": "When the 2022 Australian of the Year was announced, Dylan Alcott wheeled onto the stage. Australian audiences are tuning in to watch TV shows featuring people with disability: You Can't Ask That, Love on the Spectrum and Employable Me.          The Disability Pride movement is gaining momentum and people with disability are becoming part of the diversity conversation.On the surface, it would appear we have come a long way in our collective attitudes towards disability. But two of society's biggest \"-isms\" still go largely unnoticed and unaddressed: ableism and disablism.What do these terms mean? And how can we all do better to dismantle them?Two types of discriminationAbleism and disablism both refer to types of disability discrimination. The nuance between the two words can cause confusion but are important for acknowledging, detecting, and dismantling the types of barriers people with disability encounter.Ableism is discrimination that favors \"able-bodied\" people, or people without disability. Ableism prioritizes the needs of people without disability. A building designed without a ramp or a lift for people who require them, a lack of captions for a meeting, and stadiums without low-sensory spaces are all examples of ableism.Disablism is the inherent belief that people with disability are inferior to those without disability. It is discrimination against people with disability, like those shared in the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability. Disablism can be a more direct, conscious act of discrimination and abuse. Using disability slurs, ignoring someone, or speaking in a patronizing way are common examples.Ingrained and everywhereIf we are honest, we can acknowledge ableism and disablism are ubiquitous in our language, our homes, children's stories, media, at work and in our daily social interactions. Indeed, ableism and disablism can be so ingrained in our daily lives that most people are unaware of them.Both forms of discrimination can be subtle and insidious, making them difficult to detect and address. They often operate at systemic levels and are not identified as discrimination.A good example of systemic ableism is the forced segregation of people with disability into \"special\" schools or \"sheltered\" workplaces through limited choice and structural support of these options. Although the process of forcing people into these options no longer occurs in such blatantly disrespectful ways, the result is the same.Ableist and disablist attitudes are frequently encountered in daily conversation. Subtle ableism manifests in the use of well-intended \"empathetic\" comments, like \"I can't imagine losing my eyesight. That would be the worst.\" These remarks, even when intended to prompt a connection between two people, reveal deep-seated beliefs and create a greater divide.People with disability, along with other marginalized communities, categorize these types of interactions as \"microaggressions\".Disablist attitudes are more overt. Comments like \"If you are unable to walk down the ramp then you shouldn't have gotten tickets to this concert\" demonstrate the low expectations and damaging beliefs that impact on people's opportunities for education, employment and social interaction.      Challenging but worth itCombating disablism and ableism is a great challenge but one that is worthwhile. A broad spectrum of challenges is at play: confronting and disrupting the status quo, valuing diverse types of knowledge and experience and acknowledging the unconscious biases we all have.At a systemic and societal level, the way we design and deliver systems, polices, virtual and physical environments, products and experiences need to be co-designed in partnership with people with disability\u2014or better yet, through disability-led initiatives.Generating new ideas and better ways of working will contribute to improvements in daily life for all people\u2014just like ramps benefit parents pushing prams and people using mobility aids.The emphasis on co-design and engagement with people with disability is increasingly prevalent. However, it is critical to conduct co-design in ways that are not tokenistic and don't merely validate current practice. Frameworks like the Dignity Project Framework, which includes principles of importance for engaging with people with disability, can better support a dignified process of co-design and citizen partnership.'Not yet disabled'At an individual level, we all have a part to play in creating an inclusive future.Disability has been called the world's largest minority and is a group any person can join at any time in their life.The late disability rights activist Judith Heumann preferred to use the term \"not yet disabled\" to emphasize that we will all experience impairment and disability at some stage. Thus, we may all confront ableism and disablism at some point. The way to prepare for that time is to actively acknowledge and challenge personal biases, learn about and advocate for accessibility and inclusion in the spaces where you live, work and play and amplify the voices of people with disability at every opportunity.As advocate Sinead Burke from Tilting the Lens says in British Vogue's May issue, \"Accessibility and disability inclusion is everyone's responsibility and opportunity. This is a movement, not a moment. And it involves all of us.\" Provided byThe Conversation  This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

  "text": "Sex education in English schools is under scrutiny. A review of relationships, sex and health education (RSHE) brought forward by prime minister Rishi Sunak, will lead to new statutory guidance by the end of 2023. Sunak has also stated that schools will receive guidance on transgender issues for the 2023 summer term.          Sunak's acceleration of the RSHE education review came after Miriam Cates MP voiced concerns over \"age-inappropriate, extreme, sexualising and inaccurate\" sex education. Cates also presented Sunak with a report outlining concerns that lessons were \"promoting\" trans identification and gave a \"disproportionately dominant\" place to LGBTQ+ topics.Rhetoric like this threatens to undermine the positive progress that has been made in sex education in schools\u2014and represents another chapter in the fraught history of LGBTQ+ education.There are decades of evidence showing the value of comprehensive and inclusive relationships and sex education for all young people, not just those who identify as LGBTQ+. We need to listen to what young people want and need and educating about diversity and gender is vital\u2014a point emphasized by one of us (Dr. Sophie King-Hill) at an evidence session for the Women and Equalities Committee on the teaching of Relationships, Sex and Health Education (RSHE) in schools, held on 10 May 2023.The introduction of statutory relationships and sex education in 2020 was a key step towards the provision of LGBTQ+ inclusive education in England. For the first time, secondary schools were required to provide \"clear, sensitive and respectful\" teaching on sexual orientation and gender identity.      Section 28This move was the most recent measure to undo the damage caused to LGBTQ+ education by Section 28 of the 1988 Local Government Act. Section 28 stated that the local authority should not \"intentionally promote homosexuality\" or \"promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship\".The legislation dealt a severe blow to the LGBTQ+ community. Before this, valuable steps towards equality had been made. Homosexuality was partially decriminalized in England and Wales in 1967 and the first Pride march in the UK took place in 1972. In the early 1980s, the Greater London Council had a strong position on gay rights, establishing the Gay Rights Working Party in 1981 to investigate issues relating to gay Londoners. This was discontinued in 1986 when the Greater London Council was dissolved.Nevertheless, the passing of Section 28 came at a peak of anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment in the UK, when 64% of the population believed being gay was \"always wrong\". In practice, this meant that any already limited engagement with LGBTQ+ topics at schools disappeared.Years of influenceSection 28 informed the sex and relationships guidance for English schools issued in 2000. While this guidance made attempts to include sexual orientation, the legacy of section 28 meant the inclusion of LGBTQ+ sexualities was left up to schools\u2014and schools were told to give \"no direct promotion of sexual orientation\".Section 28 normalized discrimination and fostered the bullying of young people in the LGBTQ+ community. It lead to over 20 years of sporadic or neglected coverage of LGBTQ+ identities within schools. Section 28 was finally repealed in England in 2003.The integration of LGBTQ+ relationships and sex education content in schools has faced significant barriers. The teaching of the LGBTQ+ inclusive education program \"No Outsiders\" lessons at a Birmingham primary school in 2019 met notable opposition from parents, forcing the school to suspend delivery of the lessons.The introduction of statutory RSE in 2020 marked a step in the right direction. By the age of 18, young people are expected to be aware of damaging stereotypes surrounding sexual and gender identity.Uneven provisionHowever, despite this statutory guidance, LGBTQ+ provision in secondary schools is not comprehensive. A 2022 poll found that only 31% of students identifying as LGBTQ+ rated their relationships and sex education lessons as \"good\" or \"very good\".The 2020 statutory guidance also leaves significant room for inconsistency in LGBTQ+ provision within faith schools. As with all secondary schools, faith schools are now required to teach content on same-sex relationships.However, as highlighted within Ofsted's inspection guidance regarding protected characteristics, faith schools are still permitted to teach \"that same sex relationships and gender reassignment are not permitted by a particular religion\"\u2014though they must also explain the \"legal rights LGBT people have under UK law, and that this and LGBT people must be respected\".A 2017 survey by the charity Stonewall of over 3,700 LGBTQ+ young people found that only one in ten of these students at faith schools had received information on safe sex in LGBTQ+ relationships. One in five students at secular schools reported receiving this information.Schools have a role to play in reducing discrimination against LGBTQ+ young people. Research has found that transgender and gender-diverse young people face significant discrimination in UK schools.The government's guidance for schools on transgender issues and on sex education must not undo the progress that has been made.

  "text": "An international team of biologists, geneticists, anthropologists and biochemists has found, through genetic analysis, that the migration patterns of ancient Mexican civilizations were much more complex than previously thought. In their study, reported in the journal Science, the group generated genomic and mitochondrial DNA data to test theories surrounding the migration of ancient peoples in Mexico. Bastien Llamas and Xavier Roca-Rada with the University of Adelaide have published a Perspectives piece in the same journal issue outlining the ethical approach used by the research team to learn more about ancient Mexico.          Prior research, based mostly on archaeological evidence, has suggested that drought-driven migration of ancient people from Mexico's north to the south occurred many times in the years before Europeans arrived. The northern region, called Aridoamerica, was dry and mostly desert. The people living there at the time survived as hunter-gatherers. Farther south was Mesoamerica, where early people survived by farming.Prior research has shown that there were several long-term droughts in Aridoamerica, leading people to move south. But now it appears that these conclusions were in error. Instead of relying on archaeological evidence, the team on this new effort looked at the DNA of people living there to see if they were migrating.To learn more about the history of the people living in what is now Mexico, the researchers analyzed DNA samples going back approximately 2,300 years. In all, they were able to study 27 samples obtained from eight archaeological sites from people who lived in regions of what is now Mexico.The researchers could see that the expected migrations had not occurred. They point out, for example, that despite droughts, sometimes decades long, people living in Sierra Gorda did not leave. The team found none of their DNA in people living farther south.The research team was not able to explain why the northerners had not migrated south when conditions grew dry, but suggest it might have been related to cinnabar commerce. The mineral was easily found in the north, and was sacred to people in the south\u2014thus it seems trade was likely. Regardless of the reasons, the research team suggests migration patterns in early Mexico were far more complex than previously thought.

  "text": "While a visit to the great outdoors is a common prescription for reducing screen use, a pioneering new study finds that time outdoors doesn't always reduce smartphone screentime.          The new research, which tracked smartphone activity of 700 study participants for two years, reveals that participants' smartphone activity actually increased during visits to city parks and other urban green spaces.With smartphone use rising worldwide, the study clearly identifies a powerful way to reduce screen time: participants who visited nature reserves or forests saw significant declines in screentime over the first three hours, compared to visiting urban locations for the same amount of time.The study, published in the journal Environment and Behavior, is the first to show that young adults now spend far more time on their smartphone screens than in nature, the researchers say. Given unparalleled access to participants' devices, the team found that young adults in the study spent over twice as much time on their smartphones as they spent outdoors.\"Greentime, or time outdoors, has long been recommended as a way to restore our attention from the demands of daily life, yet before our study, little was known about whether nature provides a way for people to disconnect from the mobile devices that now follow us into the great outdoors,\" said lead author Kelton Minor, a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at Columbia University's Data Science Institute. \"While past research suggested that short trips to city parks might provide a digital detox, we saw texting and phone calls actually go up. It was really the longer visits to wilder areas, like forests or nature preserves, that helped people get off their screens and wrest back their attention from their smartphones.\"A key advance of the study is the novelty of data' richness compared to other smartphone studies, where participants typically self-report their smartphone use or environmental behaviors. In this study, participants consented to share their smartphone data\u2014over 2.5 million privacy-preserving logs of activity from texts, calls and screen time\u2014for science.      \"Smartphones have an incredibly powerful pull on our attention, which will undoubtedly increase in the future\u2014that's what many technology companies are working on,\" says University of Vermont (UVM) co-author Chris Danforth, a Gund Fellow who will co-lead a new $20M big data project on the science of storytelling. \"Given the reported connections between mental health and our digital life, we need more studies like this to help establish ways to encourage a healthier relationship with technology.\"Discussing their findings, the researchers theorize that urban greenspace may instead be useful in enhancing remote social ties\u2014hence the increase in texts and phone calls in urban parks\u2014but may interrupt the individual's opportunity to utilize the attention-restoring properties of nature.Increased smartphone use has been linked to rising cases in anxiety, depression, and sleep problems, especially in younger generations. At the same time, research from UVM and others has shown that nature has restorative benefits for our minds and bodies that deliver a sense of joy comparable to a holiday like Thanksgiving or New Year's. Researchers theorize that the visual and sensory experiences of nature help strengthen individuals' ability to better focus on life beyond their smartphones.The study is the first to compare time spent on smartphone screens to time spent in outdoor green spaces,according to the researchers. They found that even the young adults who typically used their smartphones the most reduced their usage in nature areas, providing evidence that more wild greentime may provide a digital break for even the most connected.The study\u2014\"Nature Exposure is Associated With Reduced Smartphone Use\"\u2014is by an international team of scientists from the U.S. and Europe, including Columbia University, University of Vermont, University of Colorado Boulder, University of Copenhagen, and Technical University of Denmark. Researchers included Kelton Minor, Kristoffer Lind Glavind, Aaron J. Schwartz, Christopher M. Danforth, Sune Lehmann, and Andreas Bjerre-Nielsen.

Joseph Dituri's 74th day residing in Jules' Undersea Lodge, situated at the bottom of a 30-foot-deep lagoon in Key Largo, wasn't much different than his previous days there since he submerged March 1.Dituri, who also goes by the moniker \"Dr. Deep Sea,\" ate a protein-heavy meal of eggs and salmon prepared using a microwave, exercised with resistance bands, did his daily pushups and took an hour-long nap. Unlike a submarine, the lodge does not use technology to adjust for the increased underwater pressure.The previous record of 73 days, two hours and 34 minutes was set by two Tennessee professors\u2014Bruce Cantrell and Jessica Fain\u2014at the same location in 2014.But Dituri isn't just settling for the record and resurfacing: He plans to stay at the lodge until June 9, when he reaches 100 days and completes an underwater mission dubbed Project Neptune 100.The mission combines medical and ocean research along with educational outreach and was organized by the Marine Resources Development Foundation, owner of the habitat.

During the past 74 days, he has reached over 2,500 students through online classes in marine science and more with his regular biomedical engineering courses at the University of South Florida.While he says he loves living under the ocean, there is one thing he really misses.\"The thing that I miss the most about being on the surface is literally the sun,\" Dituri said. \"The sun has been a major factor in my life\u2014I usually go to the gym at five and then I come back out and watch the sunrise.\"    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

  "answer_squad": " D4h",
  "text": "As the last continents to be settled by humans, the question of how and when people first came to the Americas has long intrigued scientists.          A new genetics study published Tuesday in Cell Reports finds that some of the first arrivals came from China during two distinct migrations: the first during the last ice age, and the second shortly after.\"Our findings indicate that besides the previously indicated ancestral sources of Native Americans in Siberia, the northern coastal China also served as a genetic reservoir contributing to the gene pool,\" Yu-Chun Li, one of the report authors, told AFP.Li added that during the second migration, the same lineage of people settled in Japan, which could help explain similarities in prehistoric arrowheads and spears found in the Americas, China and Japan.It was once believed that ancient Siberians, who crossed over a land bridge that existed in the Bering Strait linking modern Russia and Alaska, were the sole ancestors of Native Americans.More recent research, from the late 2000s onwards, has signaled more diverse sources from Asia could be connected to an ancient lineage responsible for founding populations across the Americas, including Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico and California.Known as D4h, this lineage is found in mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited only from mothers and is used to trace maternal ancestry.The team from the Kunming Institute of Zoology embarked on a ten-year hunt for D4h, combing through 100,000 modern and 15,000 ancient DNA samples across Eurasia. They eventually landed on 216 contemporary and 39 ancient individuals who came from the ancient lineage.By analyzing the mutations that had accrued over time, looking at the samples' geographic locations and using carbon dating, they were able to reconstruct the D4h lineage's origins and expansion history.The results revealed two migration events. The first was between 19,500 and 26,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum, when ice sheet coverage was at its greatest and climate conditions in northern China were likely inhospitable.The second occurred during the melting period, between 19,000 and 11,500 years ago. Increasing human populations during this period might have triggered migrations.Coastal migrationIn both cases, the scientists think the travelers were seafarers who docked in America and traveled along the Pacific coast by boats. This is because a grassy passageway between two ice sheets in modern Canada, known as the  \"inland ice-free corridor,\" was not yet opened.In the second migration, a subgroup branched out from northern coastal China to Japan, contributing to the Japanese people, especially the indigenous Ainu, the study said, a finding that chimes with archeological similarities between ancient people in the Americas, China and Japan.Li said a strength of the study was the number of samples they discovered, and complementary evidence from Y chromosomal DNA showing male ancestors of Native Americans lived in northern China at the same time as the female ancestors, made them confident of their findings.\"However, we don't know in which specific place in northern coastal China this expansion occurred and what specific events promoted these migrations,\" he said.\"More evidence, especially ancient genomes, are needed to answer these questions.\" More information:Qing-Peng Kong, Mitogenome evidence shows two radiation events and dispersals of matrilineal ancestry from Northern Coastal China to the Americas and Japan, Cell Reports (2023).

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards hybrid working?",
  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the research program at King's College London?",
  "answer_squad": " Work/Place",
  "text": "The long-anticipated return to the London office is underway\u2014but this does not mean a return to the traditional office-based working culture. Working practices are now predominantly characterized by a hybrid approach, and this transformation of at least some sectors to a \"new normal\" constitutes a significant paradigm shift in the world of work.          In a new paper, written with our research colleague Jiyoun Chang, we look at how employers in the London area experienced the COVID-19 pandemic and how this has affected their perceptions of remote working and their intentions towards managing employees' locations and methods of work going forward.We carried out in-depth interviews with 12 major London employers, in both the public and private sectors between May and August 2022, complementing and drawing on two other strands of the Work/Place research program at King's College London: a large-scale two-wave quantitative survey of London employees, and desk-based research on specific topics. We believe our work delivers important insights both for senior managers and for policymakers.What did we find?1. On balance, organizations prefer 2-3 days of hybrid working per weekFor organizations, the experience of the pandemic has induced a permanent shift in perceptions and working behaviors towards a more widespread (but not universal) hybrid model. The evidence suggests that we have reached a \"tipping point\" where norms no longer support traditional office working. While it would be premature to posit a specific \"new normal\" or \"steady state,\" there is evidence currently of convergence at around 2-3 days per week in the office for hybrid workers.2. The onus for justifying work location is now on the employer, but employees' and employers' perceptions may differNorms and expectations of workers have changed, leading to a recognized shift in the power dynamic between employers and employees. Employers may now need to justify office working rather than employees having to justify a need to work remotely. But while recognition of the potential benefits of hybrid working is shared by employers and employees, contrasting perceptions of the benefits of office work exist between employees and employers particularly with respect to its impact on employees' well-being, productivity, and development.Though debated, there is also growing recognition that hybrid working may benefit some previously marginalized employees (women, young people, those with dependents, with disability), but disadvantage those who previously thrived in an office environment.      3. Managers' perceptions of hybrid working are largely positive, but they face notable challenges, such as balancing equity and support with flexibilityMost managers generally accept that this change is inevitable and are taking steps to develop appropriate strategies to harness the benefits and mitigate the challenges of hybrid working within their organization. Attitudes from our (admittedly limited) qualitative interviews with employers are generally similar across sectors.Local authority employers are particularly conscious of the need for equity between those who can and those who can't work from home. They also retain the need to be visible to the local communities they serve and to elected politicians to whom they are accountable. These employers must blend hybrid working practices with the perceived importance that employees must remain aware of what is going on \"on the ground\" in the local area.Changes to working practices also put increased pressure on middle and line managers who manage staff performance and outputs. These pressures include both dealing with under-performance in a hybrid or remote setting (although there is consensus between employees and employers that most employees continue to work at least as hard in a remote setting) and providing appropriate support.For example, employees performing contact center work may struggle with reduced motivation and/or difficult and aggressive customers to a greater extent without the benefit of proximity to colleagues and supervisors.Human resources departments also face challenges. They must encourage adherence to organizational policies, often including a drive for increased office presence, while at the same time trying to create a work environment that is inclusive and attractive to new recruits, which often requires the provision of autonomy and flexibility over working location.There is also a delicate balance to be struck between encouraging sufficient office attendance for reasons of community, interaction, and innovation while not being coercive or counter-productive for those with working preferences and real needs which are best supported by the option to work remotely. Managing the gap (real or perceived) between management and employee expectations entails enhanced two-way communication channels. A successful shift to hybrid working requires flexibility and adaptability as much as it requires technology.Managers and HR need to continue to be aware of and mitigate the downsides of hybrid working such as work/home blurring, overwork, and isolation. At the same time, they need to harness the benefits of hybrid working for employees and the organization, such as enhanced well-being and employees' greater ability to concentrate on certain tasks at home.4. A 'one size fits all' policy is unlikely to be sufficient and ongoing adjustment is inevitableThere are also implications for policymakers of this is a profound structural shift in the world of work. Many impacts will not become clear for a while yet\u2014for example on overall productivity, on the balance of well-being benefits and disbenefits, on career progression and networking. \"One size fits all\" policy approaches and a priori ideological preferences either for fully remote or for fully in-place working are not helpful or practical.It may be possible to use lessons learned from the pandemic to try to provide enhanced opportunities and access to high quality work for disabled employees. There is a lot of untapped potential in the disabled workforce which could be valuable to employers during a time of recognized skill shortages.While the power balance between employers and workers seems to have shifted, at least for some groups of professional workers, we do not yet know what impact a recession and possible growth in unemployment will have on this and on employee and employer attitudes.5. Increased hybrid working does not signal the death of city-based workingFinally, what impact will hybrid working have on cities? We focused on a single city, London, but there will be implications for other cities with similar economic structures, challenges, and opportunities.In London, jobs remain highly centralized in the Central Activities Zone, and we do not expect this pattern to change significantly. Both firms and employees will adjust and adapt to the realities of hybrid working. Rather than hybrid work signaling the \"death of the city,\" we expect London's CAZ to continue to be a dynamic source of economic activity and employment growth, with increases in footfall and mobility back to and probably beyond pre-pandemic levels.This is driven by a gradual increase in office occupancy, as well as the return of international and domestic tourism, and growth in leisure, retail, and other activities.But there will be important long-term consequences for commuting patterns, public transport pricing and sustainability, housing markets and patterns of land use. Policymakers will need to respond to these changes, even though behaviors and outcomes are in flux: hence flexibility, adaptability and real-time evidence will be key.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards the term \"Luddite\"?",
  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the term for people who believe in the power of technology?",
  "answer_squad": " Neo-Luddites",
  "text": "The term \"Luddite\" emerged in early 1800s England. At the time there was a thriving textile industry that depended on manual knitting frames and a skilled workforce to create cloth and garments out of cotton and wool. But as the Industrial Revolution gathered momentum, steam-powered mills threatened the livelihood of thousands of artisanal textile workers.          Faced with an industrialized future that threatened their jobs and their professional identity, a growing number of textile workers turned to direct action. Galvanized by their leader, Ned Ludd, they began to smash the machines that they saw as robbing them of their source of income.It's not clear whether Ned Ludd was a real person, or simply a figment of folklore invented during a period of upheaval. But his name became synonymous with rejecting disruptive new technologies\u2014an association that lasts to this day.Questioning doesn't mean rejectingContrary to popular belief, the original Luddites were not anti-technology, nor were they technologically incompetent. Rather, they were skilled adopters and users of the artisanal textile technologies of the time. Their argument was not with technology, per se, but with the ways that wealthy industrialists were robbing them of their way of life.Today, this distinction is sometimes lost.Being called a Luddite often indicates technological incompetence\u2014as in, \"I can't figure out how to send emojis; I'm such a Luddite.\" Or it describes an ignorant rejection of technology: \"He's such a Luddite for refusing to use Venmo.\"In December 2015, Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Bill Gates were jointly nominated for a \"Luddite Award.\" Their sin? Raising concerns over the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.The irony of three prominent scientists and entrepreneurs being labeled as Luddites underlines the disconnect between the term's original meaning and its more modern use as an epithet for anyone who doesn't wholeheartedly and unquestioningly embrace technological progress.Yet technologists like Musk and Gates aren't rejecting technology or innovation. Instead, they're rejecting a worldview that all technological advances are ultimately good for society. This worldview optimistically assumes that the faster humans innovate, the better the future will be.This \"move fast and break things\" approach toward technological innovation has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years\u2014especially with growing awareness that unfettered innovation can lead to deeply harmful consequences that a degree of responsibility and forethought could help avoid.      Why Luddism mattersIn an age of ChatGPT, gene editing and other transformative technologies, perhaps we all need to channel the spirit of Ned Ludd as we grapple with how to ensure that future technologies do more good than harm.In fact, \"Neo-Luddites\" or \"New Luddites\" is a term that emerged at the end of the 20th century.In 1990, the psychologist Chellis Glendinning published an essay titled \"Notes toward a Neo-Luddite Manifesto.\"In it, she recognized the nature of the early Luddite movement and related it to a growing disconnect between societal values and technological innovation in the late 20th century. As Glendinning writes, \"Like the early Luddites, we too are a desperate people seeking to protect the livelihoods, communities, and families we love, which lie on the verge of destruction.\"On one hand, entrepreneurs and others who advocate for a more measured approach to technology innovation lest we stumble into avoidable\u2014and potentially catastrophic risks\u2014are frequently labeled \"Neo-Luddites.\"These individuals represent experts who believe in the power of technology to positively change the future, but are also aware of the societal, environmental and economic dangers of blinkered innovation.Then there are the Neo-Luddites who actively reject modern technologies, fearing that they are damaging to society. New York City's Luddite Club falls into this camp. Formed by a group of tech-disillusioned Gen-Zers, the club advocates the use of flip phones, crafting, hanging out in parks and reading hardcover or paperback books. Screens are an anathema to the group, which sees them as a drain on mental health.I'm not sure how many of today's Neo-Luddites\u2014whether they're thoughtful technologists, technology-rejecting teens or simply people who are uneasy about technological disruption\u2014have read Glendinning's manifesto. And to be sure, parts of it are rather contentious. Yet there is a common thread here: the idea that technology can lead to personal and societal harm if it is not developed responsibly.And maybe that approach isn't such a bad thing.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards the abuse in the restaurant industry?",
  "answer_race": " Critical.",
  "question_squad": " What did the chefs in the study say about Lynch's work environment?",
  "answer_squad": " 'life-changing'",
  "text": "When the The New York Times and The Boston Globe recently published expos\u00e9s in which employees of award-winning chef Barbara Lynch described their abusive work environments, we weren't surprised.          Anyone who has spent years working in restaurants probably wouldn't be surprised, either.As sociologists who study the culinary industry and its workers, we recently published research showing that many kitchen staffers come to view mistreatment and abuse as a mundane\u2014and often inevitable\u2014part of working in restaurants.'Showers of slaps' and 'grab-ass'Much of the reporting provided damning accounts of Lynch's own behavior\u2014her alleged mistreatment of employees, tirades, threats, groping and sexual innuendos.But while Lynch may be in the spotlight today, she and her alleged behaviors are, unfortunately, closer to business as usual in restaurant kitchens, where a culture of violence has been normalized.Numerous articles and chef memoirs dating as far back as the late 1800s have detailed everyday forms of abuse in restaurants. For example, pioneering French restaurateur Auguste Escoffier wrote in his memoir that his first chef \"believed that it was impossible to govern a kitchen 'sans une pluie de gifles'\"\u2014without a shower of slaps.Some, such as Anthony Bourdain's memoir \"Kitchen Confidential,\" even romanticize these behaviors. At one point, Bourdain fondly recalls a kitchen he worked in early in his career as having an \"atmosphere [that] was not unlike a Pinero play, very jailhouse, with a lot of grab-ass, heated argument, hypermacho posturing and drunken ranting. Two burly men who'd just as soon kill you as look at you, when talking to each other, would often nestle a hand tenderly next to the testicles of the other, as if to say, 'I am so not gay\u2014I can even do this!'\"The allegations against Lynch are only the latest in a long string of high-profile chefs and restaurateurs who have been accused of cultivating similar physically, psychologically and sexually violent workspaces.Mario Batali, for instance, was accused in 2019 by an employee of groping and indecency, charges that he was acquitted of in 2022 and resolved with a civil settlement.Oakland chef Charlie Hallowell and New York restaurateur Ken Friedman also came under fire during the #MeToo era, with each accused of sexual harassment and assault. Hallowell ended up selling two of his restaurants and penned a public apology, while Friedman shuttered a flagship restaurant and paid claims to 11 former employees.In our own research, we wanted to learn more about how workers deal with toxic kitchen culture. Do they ever push back? Do they flee? Or do they put their heads down and simply rationalize it as part of what they signed up for?      If you can't take the heat \u2026There are obvious economic realities that prevent many from leaving violent workspaces. After all, most everyone has bills to pay.Quitting is also hard in light of the other upsides to professional cooking, such as creativity and freedom, sensory stimulation and reciprocal joy from watching a satisfied customer eat. One sous chef we spoke with described the latter as \"life-changing to me. It was addicting.\"These pressures aside, the workers we interviewed tended to see violence as a core aspect of a hardscrabble kitchen culture that has existed for generations.Others admitted that they've come to expect as much after seeing the ways in which abusive chefs are glorified in the media\u2014think Gordon Ramsay's entertaining tongue-lashings on the show \"Hell's Kitchen,\" or Ralph Fiennes' recent portrayal of a homicidal chef in \"The Menu.\"Because those we talked to saw violence in kitchens as unexceptional, most of them responded to it by sticking it out rather than resisting it. Many of them viewed enduring violence on the job as just another task on their daily to-do list.A key element of rationalizing the violence involved justifying the perpetrator's behavior.There's evidence of this in both articles about Lynch's restaurants: Workers and the public touted Lynch as an early fighter of industry sexism, a portrayal that presented her as an ally and may have softened her blows. Her public acknowledgments of her own battles with substance abuse and childhood trauma painted her in a sympathetic light and allowed some staffers to excuse her alleged behavior.Similar rationalizations were found in our study: A chef named Jesus, for example, recounted to us a time when his boss became so upset that, after berating his crew, he \"flipped everyone off and told them to 'go f\u2014 themselves.'\" But rather than note his boss's inappropriateness, Jesus praised him for being \"straightforward\" and \"honest.\" In doing so, Jesus excused the outburst as simply a product of honesty and emotion, rather than of a work environment that bred such behavior.We also noticed that Lynch's own staff rationalized their decisions to stay\u2014despite saying they'd been subjected to abuse\u2014because they felt that working in Lynch's restaurants would help them find better jobs in the future. This approach was echoed by several cooks in our study\u2014a chef named Carsen, for example, explained away the abuse he endured once at a Michelin-starred restaurant: \"I was there for the experience. I wasn't there because I was invested in the restaurant.\"Perpetuating a culture of violenceAs workers endure violence in kitchens, they deal with not only the harms of being targeted, but also the psychological and emotional discomfort of remaining at a job that causes them suffering.Studies have also shown that learning to endure violence can increase the chances of repeated abuse, as well as the incorporation of unproductive behaviors into victimized workers' own actions. The latter can look like adopting abusive behaviors themselves or engaging in small acts of damaging rebellion, like sneaking a swig of cooking wine here or slowing the pace of work there. Cruelly, enduring violence unintentionally aids the process of making violent behavior feel and seem normal in the workplace.So a cycle of violence perpetuates and reverberates, embedding itself deeper into the fabric of restaurant kitchens, often being passed down from one generation of cooks to the next.Workers begin to expect it. Grant, a cook we interviewed, explained, \"The abuse is normalized. And sometimes romanticized as well. \u2026 Chefs being [jerks] is common in part because that's the expectation for what it is to be a chef. \u2026 And while it [seems] like most places are getting better, it's still a big part of kitchen culture.\"The accusations against Lynch are not exceptional. Sadly, we think it's likely only a matter of time before another case of an abusive high-profile chef comes to light. Outrage will occur, and then it will settle. Rinse and repeat.But culinary brilliance and artistry need not be pre-seasoned with violence. Not venerating violent kitchens and chefs would be a start. Perhaps reporting and resisting abuse, rather than enduring it, will then become the norm.

  "text": "When national student test scores revealed recently that knowledge of U.S. history and civics had reached an all-time low, one Republican lawmaker described the drop as an \"outright failure that should concern every parent across the country.\"          The test scores showed that 86% of America's eighth graders were not proficient in U.S. history, and 79% were not proficient in civics.While one top U.S. education official described the scores as \"alarming,\" the official rightly pointed out that the decline actually began nearly a decade ago.In my view as a historian of education reform and policy, the latest history and civics test scores were a predictable outcome. While it is difficult to establish an exact cause of the decline, here are four factors that I believe contributed to it.1. Pandemic fears of learning lossWhen students gradually began to return to their physical school buildings after they were closed when the COVID-19 pandemic began, researchers, politicians and critics of teachers unions began to worry about learning loss in math and reading.Historically, when there are worries about test scores in core subjects like reading and math, other subjects become less of a priority. This deemphasis on subjects beyond reading and math has taken place before. Specifically, after the Bush-era policy No Child Left Behind became the law of the land in 2002, teachers reported that the emphasis on testing took away time and resources for social studies. They also say it threatened arts education, which has been shown to benefit children's overall academic, emotional and social well-being.      2. The politicization of social studies educationAt the same time that many education experts were worried about learning loss in reading and math, conservative politicians were working incessantly to limit what can be taught in social studies.In one of his first acts as governor, Virginia's Glenn Youngkin, for example, set up an anonymous tip line for parents to report teachers who taught \"divisive concepts,\" such as the notion that the U.S. is \"fundamentally racist or sexist\" or that a person from a particular race or sex bears responsibility for past actions committed by other members of the same race or sex. The tip line has since been quietly shut down.Across the country, state legislatures led by conservative politicians have adopted bills banning instruction about aspects of U.S. history that could, they believe, make white children feel \"discomfort\" or \"guilt.\"All of this has created an atmosphere of fear for the nation's teachers, who remain largely unsure of what they can and cannot teach. For some teachers, this political context has led them to self-censor and limit what they teach about American history, potentially depriving students of a richer understanding of the nation's politics and policy.3. Education budget cutsAlthough research has long shown that funding matters for student achievement, many school districts around the country are currently struggling for adequate resources.The pandemic has amplified existing racial and economic disparities\u2014and recent national test scores in history and civics are an extension of those disparities. Not only were the average scores on U.S. history tests lower for Black students than white ones, but the decline from 2018 scores to 2022 was 42% greater for Black students. Black students collectively lost 4.5 points, or 1.8% of their average scores, from 2018 to 2022, versus 3.5 points, or 1.29%, for white students.And the situation was even more stark for low-income kids. Compared with 2018, children who are eligible for free or reduced lunch\u2014a standard measure of poverty\u2014saw their scores drop more than twice as much as they did for their higher-income peers who did not qualify for the program. Specifically, they lost five points\u2014going from 250.5 in 2018 to 245.5 in 2022, versus just two points for those who do not qualify for free and reduced lunch, who saw their scores drop from 274 to 272 between 2018 and 2022.4. Teacher shortagesMounting job stress and the blaming of teachers have led many educators to leave schools altogether, generating widespread teacher shortages.Among teachers who left the profession in 2022, a record high 64% quit, as opposed to being laid off or fired, leaving district and state leaders scrambling to lower requirements for substitutes in an effort to find adequate classroom support. Evidence suggests that experienced, professionally trained teachers are critical for students' academic achievement. With that in mind, low test scores in history and civics begin to make more sense.Keys to improvementWhat American kids know\u2014or don't\u2014about the nation's history and civics is a reflection not of the kids, but of the political and economic circumstances that affect their schools.The factors that support student learning\u2014funding, qualified teachers and high-quality curricula\u2014are well known. In my view, if history and civics scores are to improve, then what is needed is more funding for public schools, more support for professional teachers and the freeing up of educators from policies shaped by contentious political debates about what they can and can't teach about U.S. history in America's classrooms.

  "text": "Research has found that globally, small arms and light weapons increase the likelihood, intensity and longevity of conflict.          Small arms and light weapons account for most of the African continent's conflict-related deaths. An estimated 100 million light weapons circulate in Africa. About 8 million are in the hands of non-state actors in west Africa.In 1998 the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) established the world's first small arms and light weapons moratorium. It became a legally binding convention in 2006.In a recent paper, I assessed how ECOWAS members had applied the convention on small arms and light weapons. Compliance varied between countries and the paper looked at domestic political legitimacy as an explanation of these differences.I used the case studies of Ghana and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to test the explanation.The study revealed that domestic political legitimacy was paramount for effective application and compliance. Legitimacy influences how states and domestic groups behave. A lack of legitimacy can lead to illegal purchases of small arms and light weapons.The findings suggest that political legitimacy is important for states' ability to implement collective security agreements such as the one on small arms and light weapons. ECOWAS members with legitimacy challenges must be given support around implementation, because they cannot do this individually.State legitimacy as a differentiatorWhen a state is seen as legitimate, it's because those who hold power got it in widely accepted ways and wield it rightfully. A legitimate state is lawful and has authority to issue orders. Citizens obey them because the leaders have moral authority. The path to state legitimacy is through the integrity of elections or the degree to which governments represent the populations they govern.Where a state does not act legitimately, organized political opposition and sustained armed struggles or insurgencies follow. When a government lacks popular support, it will use strong-arm tactics like illegally obtaining small arms and light weapons to rule.I examined C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana's compliance trends and the role of state legitimacy. The countries are neighbors and have plenty in common, but they differ in two ways: their domestic legitimacy; and their records of implementing the region's small arms convention.I assessed compliance by looking at what countries do about illegal production and possession of weapons.      C\u00f4te d'IvoireC\u00f4te d'Ivoire was one of the top violators of the small arms conventions.For instance, Laurent Gbagbo's government between 2000 and 2011 brazenly purchased weapons using illegal documents. United Nations weapons experts uncovered vast quantities of ammunition and weapons that Gbagbo's government had bought illegally. A company linked to Gbagbo appointees unlawfully traded US$16.3 million worth of weapons to the government.Legal purchases also rose abruptly, accounting for more than 50% of small arms imported to the region in 2003 alone.Non-compliance by Gbagbo's government's corresponded with domestic legitimacy problems. Legitimacy crises around electoral processes provoked the first and second Ivorian civil wars between 2002 and 2011, increasing the demand for small arms. Gbagbo, under whose watch the small arms convention regime kicked in, chose not to implement it because of low political legitimacy.Weakened political legitimacy in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire sidetracked compliance by diverting Gbagbo's focus and rerouting opposition energy towards grabbing political power, which requires more weapons.Gbagbo contested the results of the 2010 election, won by Alassane Ouattara. He bought more weapons illegally to hold on to political power. In response, Ouattara's fighters used a military offensive to drive Gbagbo from power.Ouattara's fighters solicited illicit small arms from foreign and from neighboring sources. When forces loyal to Ouattara emerged victorious, rebels elevated to military commands used illegal weapons, while troops loyal to Gbagbo fought the state from bases in Liberia.In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, political illegitimacy morphed into territorial violence, undermining the country's compliance records.GhanaIn Ghana, no known evidence exists of Ghanaian authorities or organized groups purchasing weapons illegally. My argument is that this is due to the relatively strong legitimacy of the state and its institutions.Some Russians and Ukrainians allegedly registered front companies in Ghana and tried to use false letterheads from the Ghanaian defense and foreign ministries to sell weapons in 2003. However, these have been foiled.Since embracing the ECOWAS convention, Ghana has experienced increased political stability and democratic consolidation. Ghana's relative state legitimacy is grounded in the elite's willingness to regulate the competition for political power.The consensual and efficient management of social differences and electoral processes can explain this avoidance of state legitimacy crises. Ghana's relative stability minimizes the use of weapons.While Ghana has seen high compliance at the national level, the country has a highly developed artisanal weapon market. People make weapons in Ghana and sell them to buyers in other countries where state legitimacy has been questioned.ConclusionIn C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, domestic legitimacy problems have fuelled small arms and light weapons-seeking behaviors by state and non-state groups. In Ghana, a better record of applying the weapons convention stemmed from the country's domestic legitimacy.The findings suggest that in troubled regions like the ECOWAS zone, the state's domestic characteristics matter for a state-level application of collective security regimes and, at the regional level, for their overall success.

  "text": "In a new Ph.D. thesis from Lund University in Sweden, gender studies researcher Marco Bacio interviewed male sex workers in Sweden and Italy. What surprised him the most was that a majority of the sex workers were well-educated\u2014and middle class.          Female sex work is far more common than male sex work, and so is research about the same topic. According to Marco Bacio, however, we know less about men who sell sex. Now he has contributed to the field with in-depth interviews with 45 men who sell sex to other men, in Milan and in Stockholm.\"I knew very little about this before I started doing research myself. My image was based on a stereotype; that everyone who sold sex felt bad and that they were forced into prostitution. Therefore, it surprised me that so many were well-educated and middle class,\" he says.Marco Bacio challenges the mainstream view by arguing that sex work, at least male sex work, can actually be viewed as almost any job. The vast majority stated money as the driving force for selling sex, while a few stated other reasons, such as lust.\"The sex workers told us that the meeting with the buyer often did not consist of just sex. They saw each other for a few hours, had a coffee, and chatted a bit about everyday things,\" says Marco Bacio.In female sex work, there is often talk of the risk of violence when meeting a client. Does not the same apply to male sex workers?\"My interviewees did not mention violence at all. It may have to do with the fact that two men are often physically equally strong,\" says Bacio.Today, almost all contacts are initiated via the internet, and Marco Bacio believes that this is important for those who start selling.\"Prostitution is often stigmatized, and the threshold for selling sex has been lowered when you do not have to pick up customers on the street,\" he says.Unlike when women sell sex, it is the buyer who is most stigmatized when it comes to male prostitution. The typical client is a 45-year-old man who is married with children. According to the sex workers who were interviewed, the motive for buying sex is usually to experience intimacy with another man. Sex is not necessarily an important part of the sex worker-client relationship, although it is generally included.The interviewees also distinguished between \"regular customers\" and occasional customers. The temporary customers are more interested in sex and being sexually satisfied, while the \"regular customers\" are looking for more of an emotional exchange and to create a form of intimacy with the sex worker.Marco Bacio has analyzed sex work from the perspective of masculinity. He wants to understand the nature of the relationship that is created between sex workers and their clients and how this relationship is characterized by what is perceived as masculine.\"The sex workers see themselves as 'straight' or 'homosexual' depending on the role they have in the sexual relationship. The one who gets penetrated is considered gay, and the one who penetrates is considered straight,\" says Marco Bacio. He believes that the degree of stigmatization depends on whether the sex worker is considered gay or straight. Therefore, it has been important for those who sell sex to state that they are actually straight. In recent years, however, it has become more common to define oneself as gay.

  "answer_squad": " 2022",
  "text": "Recent results from an assessment known as the Nation's Report Card found scores in U.S. history and civics among eighth graders across the country declined compared to previous assessments. Among students who took part in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in 2022, scores in history were the lowest on record while scores in civics dropped for the first time ever.          Although a variety of factors likely contributed to the declines\u2014including the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on K\u201312 students and schools\u2014Esther Enright, an assistant professor of educational leadership at the University of Maine, notes that civics education in particular tends to be marginalized in elementary education.\"Civics is a distinct discipline that requires specialized knowledge and concepts that differ from other aspects of social studies, such as history. But it rarely gets separate attention, especially at elementary grade levels,\" says Enright, who helped lead a study published recently with colleagues William Toledo of California State University Fullerton and Katherine Landau Wright of Boise State University that looked at how discipline-specific writing can be used to get students to explore issues and topics related to civics.\"Students need the ability to write across a variety of subjects. Not just language arts, but social studies, science, math and more,\" Enright says. \"What we wanted to do was examine what happens when teachers engage students in civic perspective-taking through writing, focused on locally relevant public issues.\"As part of a larger four-year research collaboration across a state department of education, school districts and university-based researchers, Enright, Toledo and Landau Wright worked with district curriculum specialists and elementary teachers to collaboratively design units that would introduce students to civic perspective-taking.Lessons covered ideas such as fact and opinion, public issues, public good, multiple perspectives and argumentation. For example, the teachers had students practice presenting their own stance on an issue, as well as differentiating their stance from others using claims and evidence. Teachers also created opportunities for students to practice their arguments verbally before translating them into writing.The civics writing study, which spanned two years of the four-year project (2018\u201320), examined three questions: How do second and third grade students engage with civic ideas and concepts in their argumentative writing? What differences exist between second and third grade students' civic writing and argumentation? And how does students' verbal and written argumentation in civics change between second and third grade writing samples?      Second graders were asked to take a position on whether the school district should move to a year-round schedule. Third graders considered whether the local city council should allow developers to build on wetlands.The researchers' findings suggest that students' engagement with civic concepts became more complex and purposeful as they practiced argumentative writing. Both the sophistication of their civic perspective-taking and their writing developed from second to third grade.The findings also indicate that students in both grade levels were more motivated to engage in argumentative writing when asked to take positions on issues of local importance, though Enright says additional studies are needed to fully assess the impact of local issues on motivation.Although the study was conducted before the most recent NAEP assessment and focused on younger students, Enright believes there are implications for civics education at all grade levels.\"We think this research shows the importance of teachers embedding writing instruction in all disciplines and we argue that more professional development could help educators do so across the curriculum,\" says Enright, who notes that the study presents one model where a university-based research team collaborated with district curriculum specialists and classroom teachers on professional development.The civics writing study was published in the Journal of Writing Research. A companion study examining the development of preservice teachers' civic identities, co-authored by Enright and Toledo, was recently published in the Journal of Social Studies Education Research.

  "text": "One way to gauge a country's attention to the environment may be measuring how much of its economy is devoted to protecting, rehabilitating, and preserving the natural environment. While the U.S. has made prior attempts at tracking \"green jobs\" and \"green goods and services,\" the U.S. government does not currently account for this sector.          Kelly Wentland, an assistant professor of accounting at George Mason University School of Business, is helping to fill this data gap. She is the sole academic working with the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to develop a pilot account tracking the environmental, goods and services (EGSS) sector of the U.S. economy. (The UN defines ESGG as \"compris[ing]\u2026the economic activities that result in products for environmental protection and resource management.\")Wentland and the BEA team have produced a pilot EGSS account, along with preliminary results that formed the basis of a recent working paper, presented at the March 2023 NBER-CRIW conference.\"What we're doing is, we're developing a national account based on the supply side of our economy,\" Wentland explains.Ninety countries have introduced their own environmental-economic accounts based on frameworks from the UN Statistical Commission. The challenge for Wentland and the BEA team was to design their pilot account so that it would be comparable to those of other countries while aligning with established approaches from the U.S. federal government. This involved making a huge number of close comparisons between European and American product and industry classification standards to identify shared data points that mapped to UN guidelines.After carefully selecting for relevant economic activity during the years 2015 and 2019, the team used the BEA's supply-use tables\u2013extremely detailed compilations of economic inputs and outputs for more than 5,300 product categories\u2013to build their estimates.They found that EGSS accounted for $620.6 billion in 2015, and $724.5 billion in 2019. The top four categories were responsible for about 70% of the total. These were: waste management (far and away the top category, comprising one-quarter of the entire sector), management of water, wastewater management and protection of biodiversity and landscapes. This roughly matches up with equivalent studies in the EU, which also have waste management as the largest environmental-economic category, with 26%\u201327% of the total.      Wentland and her collaborators also divided EGSS activity into private- and public-sector output. In 2015, the government portion of environmental output stood at 28.3%, and the private-sector contribution at 71.7%. By 2019, the balance had shifted slightly, with 27.2% attributed to government spending, and 72.8% to commerce.Wentland stresses that the account is very much a work in progress. \"It's very important to point out that it is not an official BEA national account. It is purely a pilot effort to see how far we can get with the data the U.S. already has.\" Part of the purpose of the pilot is to identify gaps in the current data available as future avenues to improve estimates. Environmental research and development (R&D) is one potentially significant area where data were inaccessible.\"A lot of companies are putting out sustainability reports, but when you get down to what percentage of them actually include an annual dollar value attached to their activity, it's very low,\" Wentland says. She notes that the SEC's proposals for mandated environmental reporting\u2013which may be scaled down amid strong corporate pushback\u2013could help fill this void. \"The alternative is likely adding questions to other lengthy surveys the BEA collects from these companies.\"So far, the reaction to Wentland's work from government-affiliated economists has been markedly positive. \"The main critique had to do with the international guidelines for product classifications themselves, rather than our methodology,\" Wentland reports.As of this writing, further development of the EGSS pilot account hinges upon the progress of President Biden's budget for 2024. \"It's formally listed in the budget that they have an increase allocated to this as part of the increase in the BEA's budget. Obviously, we'll have to see how things pan out in terms of whether the budget moves forward.\"As Wentland sees it, calculating the dollars and cents that go into the \"green economy\" would enable granular, impact-focused policy debate on climate issues. \"You could think about research or policy that wants to say, 'When we spend more on EGSS, do we see emissions change or which types of investment have more impact than others?' You have to be able to measure both the effort and the outcome, in order to be able to say something about its effectiveness.\" More information:Accounting for Environmental Activity: Measuring Public Environmental Expenditures and the Environmental Goods and Services Sector in the US: www.nber.org/system/files/chap \u2026 rs/c14825/c14825.pdfProvided byGeorge Mason UniversityCitation:How large is the US 'green economy?'

  "text": "While people change and learn throughout life, experts recognize that certain formative periods, known as developmental windows, are crucial for acquiring particular skills. For example, using vocalizations and words to interact with people in the first few years of life is critical for children's language learning.          A recent study by an international team from UCLA, Romania and Israel suggests there may be a developmental window for reasoning skills as well\u2014the first 25 years of life\u2014and that a person's social, political and economic environment strongly influences how they acquire these skills. Their findings are published in the journal PLOS One.The researchers found that following the collapse of Romania's authoritarian communist regime in 1989, the rapid increase in education and technology use and the transition from a single, government-controlled source of information to diverse sources had a strong effect on the way people, particularly younger generations, thought about and determined truthfulness, a process known as \"epistemic thinking.\"Epistemic thinking runs the gamut from absolutist thinking, the belief that only one claim can be right, to multiplist thinking, the belief that more than one claim could be right\u2014it's just a matter of opinion. Finally, evaluativist thinking posits that assertions can be evaluated in terms of both logic and evidence.\"Whether we are monitoring various news sources or scrolling through a busy Twitter feed, we are constantly encountering diverse viewpoints about topics ranging from politics to films,\" said the study's first author, Amalia Ionescu, a doctoral student in psychology at UCLA. \"Some of these topics carry infinitely more weight than others, but ultimately, we are using the same sort of mechanism when deciding how to make sense of contrasting viewpoints.\"In the U.S., developmental psychology research has shown that children typically think in absolutist terms, then progress to multiplist thinking and sometimes, particularly with a relatively high level of education and exposure to various experiences and points of view, emerge as evaluativist adults. The study authors hypothesized that in a society ruled by an authoritarian government, with strict control over information, limited education and little exposure to the outside world, absolutist thinking would be more prevalent. Conversely, in an open, democratic society, there would likely be a higher occurrence of evaluativist thinking.To test this, they focused on Romania, which in the late 1940s became communist and aligned itself with the Soviet Union. Beginning in 1965, under the authoritarian leadership of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, Romania became increasingly repressive and isolated. After Ceau\u0219escu was overthrown in 1989, the country quickly moved toward democracy, embraced a market economy and joined the European Union. Today, Romanians have a developing education system and open access to technology, social media, consumer goods and travel.How, the researchers asked, may this transition have affected Romanians' epistemic thinking? Focusing on three age cohorts\u2014those born after the democratic revolution (18\u201330 years old), those who spent their late adolescence and early adulthood under the authoritarian regime (45\u201359) and those who spent at least 45 years under the authoritarian regime (75 and older)\u2014the authors presented respondents with scenarios in which two characters had contrasting views. They then asked the respondents: Which character is right? Or are both of them right? Why?They found that there was a greater occurrence of absolutist thinking among those who had experienced the transition to democracy in middle age rather than at an earlier period of life.The vast majority of those 75 or older tended to read or listen to the news and instantly take it as truth, \"possibly because for most of their lives, they had only one TV program to watch, and all books, news, movies and music were under communist censorship,\" said co-author Raluca Furdui, a master's student at Romania's West University of Timi\u0219oara. \"They learned to respect the authority of the teachers in schools, and some never even had the chance to go to high school.\"In contrast,\" Furdui said, \"we, the youngest generation in our study\u2014currently between 18 and 30\u2014were challenged by our teachers to express our opinions, think critically and check information.\"The researchers found that evaluativism was most common among this youngest generation, which also had the highest education levels. Lower levels of both formal education and social media use predicted higher levels of absolutist thinking and lower levels of evaluativism.The study authors concluded that the developmental window for epistemic thinking is open during the first 25 years of life, after which it slowly closes, and a person's epistemic thinking style will change little later in adulthood.\"We found that the social environment produced by a combination of democracy and a market economy more frequently led people to abandon the assumption that there is one right answer and to evaluate multiple possibilities\u2014when one was born into this environment or when it was experienced in the first 25 years of life\" rather than in middle age or beyond, said co-author Patricia Greenfield, a UCLA distinguished professor of psychology. \"We found that there is indeed a sensitive developmental period for acquiring cultural ways of thinking.\"      The 'open information' pendulum can swing the opposite way tooThe authors also said they believe their findings can help explain why unfettered access to information, social media and a plethora of personal opinions can sometimes lead in the opposite direction\u2014toward absolutist thinking and authoritarian politics.\"Along with the rise of the internet and social media, there has been, in the United States, a rise in the importance of personal opinion, along with a decline in the importance of agreed-upon facts,\" Greenfield said.And while the trend toward increasing sources of information and opinions in Romania has been associated with the democratization and opening up of society, in the U.S., the indiscriminate application of the principle that everyone has a right to their own opinion has led to information silos and absolutist thinking.\"In Romania, the transition from authoritarianism to democracy was related to a decline in absolute thinking and a rise in evaluation as a form of thought,\" said co-author Michael Weinstock, an associate professor of education at Israel's Ben Gurion University of the Negev. \"But based on our research, one would predict that that the opposite change in the environment\u2014towards more authoritarianism\u2014would lead to the opposite direction of change towards more absolutist thinking.\"Changes in the authoritarian direction happened in the U.S. under the Trump administration, the study authors said, and have recently been happening in other countries around the world.

  "text": "Flinders University and U.K. researchers have analyzed the use of disability-related taboo words to better understand how certain terms are used in the community and shed light on their negative and positive impact on people with disabilities.          The use of language is often at the frontline of efforts to promote wider community acceptance for disabled people, with the boundaries of appropriate language changing quickly in the digital age thanks to the widespread use of social media.Dedicating a chapter on \"Disability and the Power of Taboo Words\" in a new edition of The Palgrave Handbook of Disability and Communication, Professor Joanne Arciuli and co-author Professor Tom Shakespeare (U.K.) have examined why certain taboo words continue to be used in the community in a positive way and also looked at the grassroots campaigns trying to raise awareness and discourage people from using other hurtful words.Their chapter explains why some advocates and disabled people choose to claim these taboo words in favor of self-empowerment while others want some words to disappear from the everyday vocabulary to reduce stigma.In the U.K., a 2016 Ofcom study asked 248 people about taboo words to determine which terms are the most offensive. The Ofcom study suggested that mental health and disability-related taboo words could be categorized based on their level of offensiveness.This disparity in acceptable language between countries like the U.K. and the U.S. clearly highlights varying social attitudes in different parts of the world.Most recently, the twitter hashtag #CripTheVote was positively used by disability advocates in the U.S. to highlight issues which affect people with disabilities during election campaigns.\"There is a cycle where words are devised in relation to people with a disability which may, in turn, become deployed as insults. This suggests that the problem lies with social attitude towards the underlying condition, rather than the particular word used to label that condition,\" says lead author Professor Joanne Arciuli in the College of Nursing and Health Sciences.Professor Arciuli says the current scientific evidence suggests that the brain may deal with taboo words differently from regular words so they resonate powerfully, either positively or negatively.\"Language changes and taboos change too. Historically, many people with disabilities have been ignored, mistreated, or disrespected. We are still working towards the prospect of inclusion that is represented for many by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and terminology is often the frontline of efforts to promote widespread acceptance,\" says Professor Arciuli.\"The boundaries of what is acceptable, what is hurtful, radical, and what is shameful is changing fast. People with disabilities remain outsiders in many communities. The key point from our chapter in this book is to educate people away from negative attitudes toward all differences, including disability, and to promote inclusion, so that there are no outsiders.\"Professor Tom Shakespeare, a co-author of this chapter on taboo words, writes in the chapter that he has restricted growth (short stature) and has experienced many of the insulting words about dwarfism.\"You could say that what's hurtful is the attitude that underlies them, rather than the words themselves. However, it's through words that you become aware of others' attitudes,\" says Professor Shakespeare.The article's authors conclude that empowering disabled people through community participation and employment, including in influential and prominent roles, encourages understanding and respect and can be a positive step towards a more inclusive society.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards the bail reform law in New York?",
  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What did the study find?",
  "answer_squad": " the rate of increase in crimes in New York State was insignificant",
  "text": "Across the United States, legislators and the public have debated the issue of bail reform, which aims to reduce pretrial jail populations by eliminating cash bail. New York State passed legislation in 2019 to limit the use of money bail and expand pretrial release. In a new study, researchers evaluated the effect of the law on state crime rates, considering the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although rates of murder, larceny, and motor vehicle theft rose after the bail reform law went into effect, none of the increases were statistically significant when compared with a control group. This suggests that the effect of bail reform on crime rate increases was negligible.          The study, by researchers at the State University of New York at Albany (SUNY Albany), appears in Justice Quarterly, a publication of the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.\"This study is the first rigorous evaluation of how bail reform in New York State affects crime,\" according to Sishi Wu, a Ph.D. candidate in criminal justice at SUNY Albany, who led the study. \"The results can inform policymakers and address concerns expressed by the public.\" New York State's 2019 bail reform law went into effect on January 1, 2020. The law requires courts to release defendants on their own recognizance or under non-monetary conditions unless the defendants are charged with offenses listed in the legislation. Essentially, the 2019 law adopted a presumption of release and eliminated money bail and pretrial detention for all misdemeanors with two exceptions and for all nonviolent felonies with a limited number of exceptions.Following the law's enactment, pretrial jail populations declined in the state (as expected). Law enforcement officers and other stakeholders were concerned that suspects released as a result of the reform may reoffend; they were also concerned that the reform may have created a sense of lawlessness that would not deter criminals from being caught.To determine whether the law affected crime rates in the state, the authors analyzed whether bail reform was significantly associated with increased crime. When a significant association was detected, they examined whether it was causal. The study used data from the New York State index crime, which includes monthly counts for seven crimes (murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft) from January 2017 to September 2021. It also compared New York State's crime data with data from other states by examining monthly crime counts for 49 states and the District of Columbia from the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting program from January 2017 to December 2020.The study found that rates of murder, larceny, and motor vehicle theft rose after the bail reform, but the increase may have been due to the pandemic instead of bail reform. The authors controlled for the impact of the pandemic by constructing a comparison group of other states also affected by the pandemic but without bail reform in the same period. After comparing New York State with the comparison group, the study found that the rate of increase in crimes in New York State was insignificant.Among the study's limitations, the authors note that they did not consider different levels of the pandemic's impact in different states (New York State was affected early and was an epicenter of the virus's outbreak in the United States). Also, the study did not consider the effect of an amendment to the bail reform law that increased the number of eligible offenses.\"Despite multiple statements from the media and stakeholders that individuals released under bail reform are no more likely to reoffend, the public continues to believe that bail reform leads to more crime,\" says David McDowall, professor of criminal justice at SUNY Albany, who coauthored the article. \"Using findings such as ours, lawmakers and stakeholders can better address concerns about public safety.\" More information:Sishi Wu et al, Does Bail Reform Increase Crime in New York State: Evidence from Interrupted Time-Series Analyses and Synthetic Control Methods, Justice Quarterly (2023).

According to Florida International University (FIU) research published in English World-Wide. A Journal of Varieties of English, some expressions unique to the 305 area code are evidence a distinct dialect is emerging in South Florida. It's the result of a common phenomenon that happens in other regions of the world when two languages come into close contact. In this case, Spanish sayings are being \"borrowed\" and directly translated into English\u2014then passed down and used by generations who are bilingual.\"When we conduct research like this, it's a reminder there aren't 'real' words or 'pretend' words. There are only words. And all the words come from somewhere and someplace,\" said FIU sociolinguist Phillip Carter, the study's lead author. \"Every word has a history. That goes for all words spoken in Miami.\"For nearly a decade, Carter has researched Miami English\u2014a variety of English with subtle structural influence from Spanish, mostly spoken by second-, third- or fourth-generation native English speakers. He previously studied how it sounds. This time, he examined how words are used. Specifically, calques\u2014when a speaker directly translates an expression from one language, considered the \"source language\" into another language.This is what's happening in Miami. Spanish expressions are being introduced into English.The translations can be subtle. For example, \"bajar del carro\" becomes \"get down from the car\"\u2014not \"get out of the car.\" And \"una empanada de carne\" becomes \"meat empanada\" instead of the more specific \"beef empanada,\" since in Spanish, depending on the context, \"carne\" can refer to all meat (including chicken and pork) or specifically just to beef.Credit: Florida International University\"There's not a single language that doesn't have words borrowed from another language,\" Carter said. \"Borrowing is an inescapable reality of the world's languages. When you have two languages spoken by most of the population, you're going to have a lot of interesting language contact happening.\"A series of expressions commonly used in the area were given to several groups in Miami with bilingual speakers, focusing primarily on Cuban immigrants and Cuban Americans in two groups: first-generation Cuban Americans born in Cuba and who immigrated to Miami after the age of 12 and second-generation Cuban Americans born and raised in Miami who use English more than Spanish.      Most of the examples were phased out and no longer used by the second-generation participants. They didn't abandon them all, though. \"Get down from the car\" and \"super hungry\" stuck around. In fact, \"meat empanada\" and \"give me a chance\" were used with the same frequency by both the second generation and immigrant generation.\"This shows Miamians assess certain phrases differently and don't see some examples as 'ungrammatical.' So, those are the ones that are passed down,\" Carter said. \"This is how dialects are born. Minor things add up.\"How these calques were perceived by people in Miami versus outside of South Florida, was the next question Carter wanted to answer. More than 50 sentences were rated, with locals finding Miami expressions more favorable than English speakers outside of South Florida. For example, \"get down from the car\" and \"make the line\" sounded \"awkward\" to national audiences, while people in Miami said it sounded either \"perfect\" or \"okay.\"Carter says the data suggests there's a thin line separating what sounds \"foreign\" from what's acceptable in Miami. There might be some inherent language bias at play here, something his future research will investigate. More information:Phillip M.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards morality?",
  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What did the majority of people believe they were?",
  "answer_squad": " basically good and decent",
  "text": "Every day, we face a series of opportunities to do the right thing. Sometimes we seize those moments; other times, we don't. So, why do we make these choices, and what drives some people to take the moral high ground?          Jessie Sun, an assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences in Arts & Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, explored the motivations for moral behavior in a study published in the Journal of Personality.For the study, 952 people answered questionnaires about the changes they wished to make in their lives in order to become more morally good.Here, Sun discusses her findings and the surprising reasons why some people make the effort to be good.What does it mean to be moral?Morality means different things to different people, but there are a few concepts that we can generally agree on. In our study, the most common moral goal was to be more compassionate. As one respondent put it, they would like to \"practice more kindness toward others in daily life.\" Participants also valued the concepts of conscientiousness (including responsibility and self-control), honesty, open-mindedness, fairness and loyalty.What motivates people to act morally?When we think about morality, we often think about making personal sacrifices for the greater good. But in this study, we found that nearly half of respondents said they were most motivated to become more moral for their own sake. Sixteen percent said that they were most motivated to become more moral for the sake of their immediate family, and fewer participants said that they most wanted to benefit friends, acquaintances, and people in general.Moreover, many people believe that acting more morally\u2014for example, being more compassionate, more thoughtful, more open-minded\u2014would increase their own well-being. The more they believed that their desired moral change would have positive consequences for themselves, the more they reported being motivated to make that change. In short, many people are motivated to become more moral for self-serving reasons. That was the most surprising finding in our study.But people see some downsides to morality, too. Interestingly, respondents generally expected fewer benefits to themselves and others if they were honest. You can imagine that some people regularly tell white lies to save other people's feelings, and they believed it would be hurtful if they were honest.If morality is self-serving, why aren't more people making more moral choices?If there's one thing we know from psychology, it's that change is difficult\u2014even if we think it will be good for us in the long run. And even if it's beneficial to be more moral in an absolute sense, there might be relative tradeoffs when considering other changes you could make.What are some common goals around morality?Our study found that people are especially interested in improving positive traits. They see potential value in being fairer and more compassionate, for example. To a lesser extent, they are also willing to consider reducing their negative tendencies, such as not being so judgmental or argumentative.Is morality really all that important to most people?Most people believe they're basically good and decent, but they also tend to give themselves too much credit. In previous studies, my colleagues and I have asked people about the things they'd like to improve about themselves. People often say they'd like to be less anxious, more productive or more active, but they're less likely to say that they'd like to be more thoughtful, honest or compassionate.Normally, if people know they have a problem with something, they want to fix it. If they're extremely introverted, they usually want to become more comfortable in social situations. But if someone says they aren't especially honest, humble or compassionate, they tend to not be especially compelled to improve those aspects of their lives. Morality just isn't a high priority for most people. More information:Jessie Sun et al, How and why people want to be more moral, Journal of Personality (2023).

Researchers from Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) canvassed almost 400 individuals in the UK aged between 18 and 77, split equally between men and women, and the results have been published in the journal Body Image.Participants were asked to rate their agreement or disagreement with a series of statements assessing their perspective of poverty, such as the extent of their belief that people living in poverty are \"personally deficient,\" as well as assessing their views on the causes of obesity and prejudice towards people who are larger-bodied.Researchers also recorded responses to 15 suggested policies and laws, such as \"it should be illegal to fire a qualified employee because of their body weight,\" or that \"schools should have anti-bullying policies that protect students from being bullied about their weight.\"Among both women and men, the researchers found that a stronger belief that individuals are responsible for living in poverty was significantly associated with lower support for weight-related anti-discrimination policies and laws.They also found that a stronger belief that individuals are responsible for living in poverty was associated with holding stigmatizing or prejudicial views on weight, and greater prejudice toward larger-bodied individuals.Lead author Viren Swami, Professor of Social Psychology at Anglia Ruskin University, said, \"Beliefs about weight don't occur in a vacuum.

  "question_squad": " What is the term for when a student submits work as their own?",
  "answer_squad": " academic ghostwriting",
  "text": "Since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, academics have expressed concern over the impact the artificial intelligence service could have on student work.          But educational institutions trying to safeguard academic integrity could be looking in the wrong direction. Yes, ChatGPT raises questions about how to assess students' learning. However, it should be less of a concern than the persistent and pervasive use of ghostwriting services.Essentially, academic ghostwriting is when a student submits a piece of work as their own which is, in fact, written by someone else. Often dubbed \"contract cheating,\" the outsourcing of assessment to ghostwriters undermines student learning.Universities and other institutions have employed plagiarism-detection tools, such as Turnitin, in an effort to combat the more obvious forms of academic misconduct.But contract cheating is increasingly commonplace as time-poor students juggle jobs to meet the soaring costs of education. And the internet creates the perfect breeding ground for willing ghostwriting entrepreneurs.In New Zealand, 70-80% of tertiary students engage in some form of cheating. While most of this academic misconduct was collusion with peers or plagiarism, the emergence of artificial intelligence has been described as a battle academia will inevitably lose.It is time a new approach is taken by universities.Allowing the use of ChatGPT by students could help reduce the use of contract cheating by doing the heavy lifting of academic work while still giving students the opportunity to learn.The risky business of ghostwritingUniversities have been cracking down on ghost writing to ensure quality education, to protect their students from blackmail and to even prevent international espionage.Contract cheating websites store personal data making students unwittingly vulnerable to extortion to avoid exposure and potential expulsion from their institution, or the loss of their qualification.Some researchers are warning there is an even greater risk\u2014that private student data will fall into the hands of foreign state actors.Preventing student engagement with contract cheating sites, or at least detecting students who use them, avoids the likelihood of graduates in critical job roles being targeted for nationally sensitive data.      ChatGPT as friend not foeIt is inevitable ChatGPT will increasingly become part of how students complete their assigned work. While changing the way assignments are completed\u2014and assessed\u2014there are a number of reasons why ChatGPT could also be harnessed as an educational tool.ChatGPT still requires a certain level of engagement from students. They have to guide the AI through various stages of the research and writing process. By meticulously defining their research question, crafting precise prompts, critically assessing generated content and integrating it with their original thoughts, students retain control over their intellectual journey.Given the underworld associated with ghostwriting, artificial intelligence has the potential to bust the contract cheating economy. This would keep students safer by providing them with free, instant and accessible resources.Using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, ChatGPT fosters originality by offering students instant, personalized feedback. By stimulating creativity, broadening vocabulary and enhancing structural coherence, ChatGPT could cultivate an environment where students can flourish and develop their distinct style.Finally, those who argue that artificial intelligence technologies like ChatGPT may contribute to the erosion of academic integrity overlook the game-changing potential of this sort of technology to refine citation practices. ChatGPT can provide students with style guides and citation generators. These tools can enable students to appropriately credit sources and circumvent plagiarism.By inputting the relevant context, ChatGPT can assess the author backgrounds, considering cultural, political and ethical biases that may influence their views. In turn, ChatGPT can recommend alternative readings that offer a well-rounded array of viewpoints.Leveling the playing fieldArguably, the most significant advantage of artificial intelligence tools lie in their potential to level the playing field for students.Students from diverse backgrounds face several challenges, including navigating uncharted academic terrain, adapting to unfamiliar environments, and grappling with the pressures of independence. These obstacles are amplified for marginalized students and those attending underprivileged schools.Academic integrity fundamentally hinges on promoting fairness in the educational process. However, ensuring equal access to resources and support for all students is a daunting task, particularly when confronted with large classes or students with varying academic preparedness.ChatGPT can serve as a valuable tool in advancing academic integrity by granting all students access to the same resource for honing their writing skills and obtaining feedback on their work, irrespective of their backgrounds or academic prowess.There needs to be more research on the learning opportunities offered by artificial intelligence programs like ChatGPT. But it is here, and for a variety of reasons students are using it. Rather than banning ChatGPT and programs like it, we should be using these tools to help students. In doing so, we would reduce the need for students to seek out other\u2014potentially harmful\u2014ways of completing their assessments.

  "text": "China will no longer be the world's most populous nation. India's population will overtake it this year at an estimated population of 1.42 billion.          It's an epochal transition which speaks to other underlying demographic changes across the world, including the fact that China's population has peaked and is now falling. Meanwhile, the region with the fastest-rising population\u2014from a current base of around 1.4 billion\u2014is Africa.I have researched the economics of China, and China-Africa relations, for nearly two decades. I've also specifically analyzed the political economy of demographic change in China.On the surface, China losing the \"world's most populous country\" crown means nothing for African countries. However, as I outline in my new paper, the transition embodies a number of opportunities and risks for many African countries.China has been a leading economic partner to the continent for most of this century. Demand for China's manufactured goods is consistent across the continent. It is an especially important import partner for some of Africa's resource-rich countries, such as Angola, Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia. A slow-down in China's economy\u2014or a shift away from commodity-intensive manufacturing and infrastructure construction\u2014could especially challenge African commodity exporters whose main buyer is China, such as Angola.So, as China's population declines and ages, there'll be direct and indirect repercussions for many African countries. Here are some of the possible implications.      OpportunitiesEnd of labor-richnessAfrican countries with a large working-age population can theoretically benefit from the end of China's period of labor-abundance. China had a massive number of low-wage workers from the 1980s until the 2000s. The broad passing of this abundance\u2014in terms of both price and quantity\u2014theoretically opens a window for other \"younger\" and low-wage economies. Labor rich countries already banging on China's door include Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam.African countries wanting to take advantage of this will need relevant policies. They will need enough qualified workers to take part in manufacturing opportunities; affordable and reliable energy; and competitive labor productivity. Ethiopia, for instance, has been attracting Chinese foreign direct investment in recent decades with more than 70% going into manufacturing.Increased service demandFor a decade or more, China has also been pushing, if very incrementally, for services\u2014such as financial services, healthcare and tourism\u2014to drive its domestic growth. This presents new opportunities for African goods and services providers too.Things are already in the works. The official 2035 China-Africa Vision\u2014which defines the overall framework of China-Africa cooperation\u2014includes finance, tourism, media, and culture and sports. Some of these links, like the media industry, are relatively advanced already. Some countries, for example Mauritius, have already signed trade agreements which include financial services. And, more recently, Kenya Airways and China Southern Airlines signed an agreement to expand Nairobi's role as a regional aviation hub for Chinese destinations.China's pensioner boomThe pensioner population is expected to peak mid-century when China is forecast to be home to some 400 million pensioners\u2014a massive target market. Cambodia, for example, already has an official strategy for attracting elderly tourists.African countries could tap into this demographic, for instance to support tourism industries. East African countries are looking for emerging tourist markets and also looking to expand offerings to include activities such as cruises\u2014these would be ideal for an older demographic.RisksSlowdown in China's economyA big risk is that as China's population declines and ages it will cause China's economic development engine to falter.As it's one of the world's largest economies, a stagnation would cause ripples across the world. It would slow China's potential to trade with and invest in Africa.For instance, China is South Africa's largest export market. Nigeria, Angola, Egypt and the Democratic Republic of Congo are also major exporters of goods to China. Nigeria is the leading importer from China, followed by South Africa, Egypt and Ghana.Some countries are relatively China-dependent for growth and development. These include Zimbabwe and Guinea.China could become more risk-averse in lending to African countries, and conservative in foreign aid allocations. Leading Chinese companies might also have less revenue to re-invest in other markets, and less reason to do so given lower growth. This could challenge African government budgets and leave many in poverty and unable to find formal jobs in their working-age prime.Keeping production at homeThere is also the risk that automation will directly replace labor in China, instead of shifting production to another country with a younger workforce. And foreign investors in China might seek to secure their own supply chains\u2014at home\u2014rather than shift production to a new labor-rich location after China.Regulatory challengesAfrica could face new regulatory challenges as China's population ages. Products demanded by an older Chinese population, with inputs sourced in Africa, may elevate existing regulatory challenges.For instance, a Chinese traditional medicine known as ejiao uses collagen from donkey hides. It is believed to support sleep, blood vitality and those aging in general. This has led to a trade in African donkeys that has harmed Africa's own poor .ConclusionIn my opinion a probable scenario is that China's economy lumbers forward at a slower pace than in the past, but fast enough to stave off a crisis at home.On the surface this may reduce the scale of opportunity for Africa. But, since China's economy is many times larger than any economy in Africa, there'll still be enough growth volume to tap for trade, investment and specific projects. Slower growth in China may even compel Chinese investors to turn to faster-growing African economies.Africa is the world's youngest continent, and fast-aging population-declining China is the continent's most important trade partner and economic partner. African governments must keep a close eye on what happens next to tap into all potential opportunities\u2014and mitigate any risks.

In this ritual, Panthers fans throw plastic rats onto the ice to summon the energy of past, unexpected successes.          A group of extraterrestrials watching this event might be puzzled to see hundreds of otherwise normal people hurling mass-produced rodents at a few dozen tired men with unkempt facial hair. If, as sport fans, we set our past experiences to the side, these superstitions that are so pervasive in sport\u2014especially when the games carry the most weight\u2014really make very little objective sense.As an ardent sport fan for most of my life\u2014and someone who may or may not have participated in fan rituals\u2014I'm in no position to judge.

I have now been studying sport fans for about 15 years, and if I've learned one thing, it's this: rationality and objectivity generally do not apply in sports fandom.The superstitious athleteAlthough all sports have their share of superstitious participants, hockey players have certainly earned their reputation for being at the high end of the range.As I alluded to earlier, playoff beards become ubiquitous among players at this time of year. This seemingly age-old tradition only dates back to the early 1980s, but has become ingrained in hockey culture among amateurs and professionals alike.Baseball players are certainly not to be outdone as a superstitious group\u2014for example, it's taboo to talk about a no-hitter. In the 1989 movie Major League, the Cuban baseball player Pedro Cerrano (played by Dennis Haysbert) used supernatural means to magic his bat. As contrived as the character might have appeared to the average person, most baseball fans would believe that such a player could (and probably does) exist.For some athletes, superstitions aren't just meaningless, irrational behaviors; they can have positive effects on mental state and performance. Superstitions can boost confidence and sense of control, as well as reduce anxiety\u2014really, it's the routine that prepares the body and mind for the performance, rather than the specific behavior itself.Superstitions may not be as readily prescribed by sport psychologists as meditation or visualization, but for some athletes, they can serve a similar purpose.      Fan superstitionsLike athletes, fans also tend to exhibit numerous superstitious behaviors both at the game and in other locations, either before or during the game. These superstitions can be group-based\u2014like the rat trick\u2014or personal.Some of the most common personal behaviors include wearing certain articles of clothing (special underwear and socks are particularly popular), sitting in a particular place and eating or drinking specific foods.But if we can understand why athletes succumb to superstition based on actual benefits, how can we justify these behaviors among fans? They have no direct involvement in the game. Well, the benefits for fans are not actually that different from those for athletes.Handling uncertaintyIn general, humans don't handle uncertainty very well. We crave order in our lives, and fundamentally need to explain the underlying causes of important events or outcomes.In the absence of concrete answers, we start to make up explanations of our own\u2014these are known as attributions. We especially tend to attribute sporting success to factors that are under our control, like player and coach performance or fan involvement. And we attribute failure to things beyond our control, such as the other team's performance, referees' actions or fate.Superstitions help us feel like we have some control over the uncontrollable. There have only been a handful of academic studies on fan superstition, but the findings tend to be consistent. By engaging in superstitions, fans feel as if they're doing their part to help the team.When the team wins, being involved generates an even more positive mood, likely due to the perceived satisfaction of helping the team. On the other hand, carrying out the appropriate superstitions can have positive effects on mood even after a loss, possibly because the fan feels as though they did everything they could to help the team. Superstitions can also reduce the stress associated with watching a game among avid fans.It's worth pointing out that \"fair-weather fans,\" who only support the team when it's doing well, generally aren't doing this stuff\u2014the team has to be very important to us in order for us to be compelled to engage in superstitions.Academic research refers to these passionate supporters as \"highly identified fans,\" because the fan role is a central and important part of that person's identity and self-concept. As such, their sport fandom is closely tied to their self-esteem, which is why watching sports is such a heavily invested, emotional experience for these highly identified fans (myself included).Spectator sport is one of the most unpredictable things in the world, so we have a desire to combat this uncertainty and control what's happening by any means possible, rational or otherwise.During playoff time, be kindSport superstitions make very little sense to non-sport fans, because they haven't experienced the intensity of emotions and mental gymnastics that come with being a highly identified fan.It's more than a pastime, it's a big part of who we are and how we see ourselves.And to anyone who couldn't care less about the playoffs, please just indulge the sport fans in your life and let them do whatever it is that makes them feel better at this time of year. That includes you, Mrs. Eddy. Provided byThe Conversation  This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

  "question_squad": " What is the term for when a person looks at a photo and decides if it matches?",
  "answer_squad": " face matching",
  "text": "On Thursday May 4, for the first time, members of the public voting in local council elections in England were required to bring photo ID to their polling station. Initial reports suggested that a few people were turned away because they didn't bring one of the approved forms of photo ID.          But even if they did bring the right documents, such as a driving license or passport, there's a question mark over whether the people manning polling stations could tell accurately whether the voter was the person pictured in the ID.When you present your photo ID to be checked, the person looking at it has to decide if your face matches the picture in the document. In a lab, this is usually done with images and is called \"face matching\". Such studies typically present two face images side-by-side and ask people to judge whether the images show the same person or two different people.While people perform well at this task when they are familiar with the person pictured, studies report the error rate can be as high as 35% when those pictured are unfamiliar. Even when people are asked to compare a live person standing in front of them with a photo, a recent study found they still got more than 20% of their answers wrong.Natural abilityThe people checking our photo ID are almost always unfamiliar with us, so we should expect that this is a difficult, error-prone task for them. And while you might think that people whose job it is to check photo ID would be better at it than the rest of us, cashiers, police officers and border control officers have all been shown to be as poor at face matching as untrained people.The study of border control officers also showed they don't improve at the task as time goes on\u2014there was no relationship between their performance and the number of years they had spent in the job.This suggests that face recognition ability doesn't change with practice. While repeated exposure to variable images of one person's face can help you to recognize them, professional facial image comparison courses aimed at training face identification ability have not been shown to produce lasting improvements in performance.There is, however, an argument for the role of natural ability in face recognition. People known as \"super-recognizers\" perform far better than the general population at tests of face recognition, and have been used by police forces to identify criminals.For example, super-recognizers could be asked to look through images of wanted persons and then try to find them in CCTV footage, or match images caught on CCTV to police mugshots. Some of us are just better than others at these types of task.Error-prone taskBut why is it so difficult for most of us to recognize an unfamiliar person across different images? We all know that we look different in different pictures\u2014not many of us would choose to use our passport image on a dating website. And this variability in appearance is what makes unfamiliar face matching so difficult.When we are familiar with someone, we have seen their face many times looking lots of different ways. We have been exposed to a high amount of this \"within-person variability\", enabling us to put together a stable representation of that familiar person in our minds.In fact, exposure to within-person variability has been shown to be crucial for learning what a new face looks like. With unfamiliar people, we just haven't seen enough of their variability to reliably decide whether they look like the image in their photo ID.Photo ID at electionsHere's what this means for photo ID at elections, which was introduced as an attempt to tackle voter fraud. In fact, aside from the issue of people not having the required form of photo ID in order to vote, having people at polling stations check photo ID may not actually be a reliable way of verifying voters' identities.People could be falsely matched to an incorrect ID, or incorrectly turned away on the basis that they don't match the photo in the document. Unfamiliar face matching is error-prone, and can't be reliably trained.So, unless the people at the polling stations are super-recognisers, they may find it difficult and make errors when matching voters to their photo IDs.

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the organization that defines procurement?",
  "answer_squad": " The Institute of Supply Management",
  "text": "Everybody is a student of \"procurement,\" whether they realize it or not.          \"It's really what we do every day,\" said Joe Walden, associate teaching professor of business at the University of Kansas.\"When you go to the grocery store, you're there to do procurement. You're finding suppliers, negotiating with them on quality terms and delivery price, then receiving and paying for it.\"Walden's new article \"What are we teaching our procurement students?\" looks at why there is a talent gap in the industry, which can be traced to what future supply chain managers and procurement professionals are learning in college. The paper analyzes what these professionals are expected to know and what hiring officials are seeking, then offers recommendations for how this can be addressed by academic programs. It's published in the Journal of Supply Chain Management, Logistics and Procurement.The Institute of Supply Management (ISM) defines procurement as \"the identification, acquisition, access, positioning, management of resources and related capabilities an organization needs or potentially needs in the attainment of strategic objectives.\"While the definition of this subset of supply chain is pretty well-acknowledged among professionals, Walden said there are still key areas that are undervalued within the career field.\"One of the most important parts of procurement is understanding quality,\" he said. \"We've learned through so many experiences that the lowest price doesn't guarantee the best quality. Sometimes lowest price equals lowest quality, which is really why a lot of companies have gotten away from going to the lowest bidder and finding what they've started to call the 'best supplier.'\"Ethics is another aspect that Walden said is critical to not overlook.\"Dealing with ethical suppliers. Dealing ethically with the suppliers. Going through the process of finding quality vendors with quality products that can deliver it when you need it\u2014that combination of quality and ethics are probably the two most important pieces,\" he said.Walden said one of the fundamental misunderstandings about the field is that it's easy. Simple, even.      \"People assume, 'We all buy stuff, so we all understand procurement.' But it's extremely difficult. You've got to locate the suppliers, especially if it's a new product. You've got to go find people who actually have those materials you need. And you've got to make sure it comes when you want it. Plus, it needs to be the right quality at the right price,\" he said.Those who viewed procurement as easy may have experienced a change of attitude after the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the byproducts of the event, Walden said, is it forced individuals to realize products didn't just magically appear. The so-called \"Amazon effect,\" in which a purchase is expected to show up two days later, often proved no longer reliable or stable.\"Everyone expects that if you buy an item, it will be there on your doorstep. Well, if the procurement guy didn't forecast to buy enough, it's not there. I can throw all the money I want at it, but it's not going to make stuff get to you faster,\" he said. \"The beauty of the pandemic is it forced folks to look at supply chain and procurement through a magnifying glass.\"Raised in North Carolina, Walden spent 26 years in the U.S. Army, with an additional five working as a contractor. There, he developed his expertise in warehousing and distribution, which included designing a 4.2 million-square-foot distribution center in Kuwait for Operation Iraqi Freedom. He retired as a colonel.He said he hoped his assessment of the procurement talent gap would convince those in supply chain academia to reexamine their curriculum.\"Even the top schools with the top supply chain programs in the world aren't necessarily teaching all the critical skills,\" Walden said.\"So if students want to go into the procurement field when they get out, I want to make sure they're taught ethics, negotiation, supplier selection and supplier evaluations\u2014things that aren't always being taught right now. We need to get academia to realize what they need to start doing so that our students are more competitive.\" More information:Paper: What are we teaching our procurement students?Provided byUniversity of KansasCitation:Reasons for talent gap in procurement field examined in new business analysis (2023, May 11)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-talent-gap-field-business-analysis.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Psychologists from Lancaster University are investigating the teacher's role in generating wonder in the classroom.          Dr. Marina Bazhydai said, \"Wonder is a feeling like no other, making us want to engage with a puzzling phenomenon we have encountered. It's an emotive, reflective, and meaning-making experience.\"Put simply, wonder is a feeling of puzzlement about something that seems important and interesting. It's not an easy concept to define. And yet research has shown that wonder is invaluable for learning: it increases students' intrinsic motivation to actively pursue explanations, ask questions and reflect on new information; it widens their horizons and general interests; and it deepens their emotional engagement with the pursuit of knowledge.\"Dr. Bazhydai and Dr. Daphne Barker at the Active Learning Lab at Lancaster University have already worked with over four hundred primary schoolchildren in the U.K. in order to develop an assessment tool for wonder.The children completed a 30 minute survey, \"A Wonder Chart,\" which asked them to respond to statements based around short stories or videos.Based on their responses to the prompts, researchers calculated a \"wonder index,\" which can be used as a quantitative measure of how much wonder the child is prone to experiencing.So far, they have found that children aged between 9 and 11 are sensitive to experiencing wonder which is distinct from other emotions such as feeling happy and states of curiosity.Dr. Bazhydai said, \"We know that wonder has the potential to have a positive effect on learning. But due to its elusive nature, we know little about how this plays out, or how much wonder is actually happening in school settings.\"Researchers are now actively recruiting teachers to investigate their role in generating wonder in the classroom.This makes use of a theoretical framework from Vrije University in Amsterdam, which identified eight educational strategies teachers should deploy to create \"wonderful\" education in the classroom:Be sensitive to children's personal wonder experiences and guide them furtherBe a role model by sharing their own wonder experienceCreate conditions for exploration, experimentation, questioning and reflectionFacilitate meaning-making with the lesson contentStimulate imagination and creativity based on lesson contentDefamiliarize the familiar by emphasizing the wonderful in everyday lifeEncourage contemplation and attentive awarenessDesign enriched environments through nature, art and technologyThey have created a \"Wonder-full Education Questionnaire,\" which asks teachers about their own practice in relation to each of the eight strategies.Dr. Barker said; \"We want teachers to feel empowered to implement the wonder-full education approach in their classrooms, but first, they need to reflect on how often they are doing this already, and what this looks like in practice.\"If you are a Key Stage 2 teacher or teaching assistant in the U.K. schooling system, you can be involved in this research by completing a 10\u201315-minute online survey.

  "question_squad": " What is the poverty rate for people with disabilities?",
  "answer_squad": " 32%",
  "text": "A new national report has exposed for the first time how people with a disability or experiencing ill health are significantly more likely to find themselves homeless. The report, written by researchers at the University of Bristol and University of Leicester, shows there has been a huge rise in these groups experiencing poverty and being under threat of homelessness\u2014an increase of 73% in England between 2018/19 and 2021/22.          Its findings also highlighted that people with disabilities face many barriers to getting support and escaping homelessness, including difficulty getting a diagnosis, unsuitable environments, and a shortage of accessible housing.This comes alongside findings that working age adults with disabilities are more than twice as likely than peers to live in poverty in 2022.The first-of-its-kind report, called \"Homelessness and Disability in the UK,\" was commissioned by the Center for Homelessness Impact.Drawing on government data and research reports, headline statistics highlight that:Between 2018 to 2022 in England, households accepted as homeless by reason of physical ill health or disability increased by 73%.82% of people experiencing homelessness in England have received a mental health diagnosis.There is a shortage of accessible housing across the U.K.\u2014in England only 7% of homes incorporate minimal accessibility features and in Scotland only 0.7% of local authority housing is wheelchair accessible.The poverty rate for people with disabilities is 32%, 12% higher than poverty rates in the general population. Disability employment rates of 53% remain significantly lower than the employment rate of the general population (83%). These social and economic barriers are also causes of homelessness, suggesting that people with disabilities may be at increased risk of experiencing homelessness.People with disabilities are over-represented in homeless populations, but the issue may be underestimated due to a lack of understanding and inconsistent data recording.The report calls for more consistent levels of provision, including tackling the postcode lottery of effective support and improving housing in conjunction with support.The Center for Homelessness \"End it With Evidence\" campaign calls on policy makers to build a stronger evidence base for what works in tackling poverty and homelessness, put these insights at the fingertips of people who work in the sector, and create a culture change within the entire system to ensure that evidence-based practice is embedded.      Lead author Dr. Beth Stone, a lecturer in Disability Studies at the University of Bristol, said, \"Many people with disabilities in the U.K. are subjected to unacceptable standards of living and face significant barriers to inclusion in society. The risk of people with disabilities experiencing homelessness has become especially critical in recent years.\"Government and research data illustrates a troubling pattern of the overrepresentation of physical and neurodevelopmental conditions in homeless populations. Understanding the scale and depth of the intersection between disability and homelessness is vital to improving future outcomes.\"Co-author Emily Wertans, a researcher at the University of Leicester, added, \"For people experiencing both disability and homelessness, the challenges for navigating either situation are amplified. Without addressing the full diversity and needs within a person's circumstance, the risk of both disability and homelessness worsening is significantly increased.\"Effective support both in terms of homelessness prevention and response must center around an accessible, person-centered, evidence-based approach from spaces that have received specialist training and resource.\"Ligia Teixeira, Chief Executive of the Center for Homelessness Impact, said, \"Our report highlights consistent higher levels of physical disabilities and health conditions within households impacted by homelessness. Distressingly, it finds that barriers faced by people with a disability make it harder to get support and to exit homelessness.\"These obstacles include difficulties in getting a diagnosis from a GP, in order to get support; unsuitable environments such as noisy homeless hostels that can overwhelm people with some neurodevelopmental conditions; and acute shortages of accessible housing with lifts, ramps, mobility aids and lowered surfaces that are essential to daily living for people with certain disabilities.\"This seems wrong on multiple levels. It means their chances of exiting homelessness on their own initiative are severely limited. They depend on the system working well in every instance.\" Provided byUniversity of BristolCitation:UK report reveals people with physical disabilities and health conditions are at much greater risk of homelessness (2023, May 11)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-uk-reveals-people-physical-disabilities.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_squad": " Fields Medal",
  "text": "Far from keeping up the good work, recipients of internal symbolic awards such as employee of the month or merit certificates perform worse after receiving the accolades, according to a recent international study published in Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes.          It's not always that awardees lose the drive to perform after proving their worth, says co-author Runjing Lu, a finance professor in the Alberta School of Business. In many cases, co-workers will subsequently undermine the winners' success.\"There have been a handful of papers published on the negative effects of symbolic awards, but they all focus on how the awards affect the participants' own behavior and motivation,\" notes Lu.\"We found it's not just the awardees themselves who are affected; there could also be a kind of social sabotage going on.\"Lu defines a symbolic award as \"a special type of non-monetary incentive whose value resides primarily in the public recognition of recipients.\"Monetary rewards have long been regarded as problematic, she says, because they can provoke jealousy, resentment and other \"corrosive\" effects among employees. Symbolic awards had been considered a promising alternative.But the findings by Lu and co-author Teng Li of Sun Yat-sen University point to a darker side of human nature. Especially in competitive workplaces with limited resources, internal symbolic award winners tend to become targets of subversion, she says.In surveys of symbolic award recipients in this study, many said social undermining tends to be more passive; co-workers simply withdraw offers of help. But in some cases co-workers will go further, even poaching customers from award recipients involved in sales.The downside of singling out top performersPrevious research has shown that symbolic awards hamper performance mainly because recipients feel they've reached the required bar and no longer need to expend the same effort, says Lu.One study, for example, revealed that students recognized for perfect attendance were subsequently absent more often from school. Another showed that winners of the Fields Medal\u2014one of the world's highest honors for mathematicians\u2014published fewer academic papers after receiving the prize. And firms whose CEOs received awards had worse stock and operating performance in their wake.What the new study reveals, however, are the interpersonal factors that can aggravate a decline in performance.\"It's not that symbolic awards are always bad,\" says Lu. \"They can work well in situations where the competition is not that intense\u2014where your success doesn't depend on my failure.\"But in organizations where resources are limited, singling you out as a top performer signals to co-workers to compete for your resources. They have strong incentives to push you down.\"Culture mattersCultural context also matters, she says. The study examined a large branch of a leading insurance firm in China and found that social undermining of award recipients was more pronounced than typically documented in the West, potentially due to an emphasis on group harmony as opposed to individual achievement in Asian culture.\"Participants from Asian collectivist cultures exhibited a higher preference for high achievers to fail than those from individualistic cultures,\" says Lu. \"In a collective culture, you don't want to stand out.\"Her advice for companies that want to recognize individual achievement?\"Think first\u2014is it a competitive or non-competitive environment? In competitive environments, you might not want to single out a person too much, because you're basically setting up a target for others to attack.\"Lu adds that company managers could also monitor co-workers' behavior and punish those who engage in sabotage\u2014a less-than-ideal approach that can produce its own backlash, she admits.Another solution is to simply increase the base-level salary for everyone on a given team, Lu suggests.\"Then if somebody gets an award, you're already well rewarded. You don't have the same incentive to sabotage others.\" More information:Teng Li et al, Social undermining as a dark side of symbolic awards: Evidence from a regression discontinuity design, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes (2022).

  "text": "Long-standing policies and deeply rooted inequity\u2014rather than a few \"bad apples\" in the criminal justice system\u2014likely explain why Black defendants in certain parts of the country are more likely than others to be held in jail before trial, according to new research from the University of California, Berkeley.          But a relatively easy fix could be a key to undoing those racial disparities in pretrial detention.\"We rely on pretrial detention much too often, and there are huge human and fiscal costs,\" said Jennifer Skeem, a professor of public policy and social welfare at UC Berkeley.A pair of recently published papers suggest that an overreliance on a defendant's criminal history has inflated the number of people sitting behind bars while their cases grind through the courts. Confronting the outsized role of such details in pretrial reports and improving how these reports are written could help identify who actually needs to remain in jail before trial and who can be safely released, said Skeem, a psychologist and lead author of the two new papers.\"We found that a majority of defendants who are detained are really at quite a low risk for either committing a new offense or failing to appear for their current one,\" Skeem said.The reports add depth to ongoing debates about the role and risks of pretrial detention, the nation's reckoning with race in the criminal justice system, and the policy options for methodically and safely decreasing jail populations.In research published in the journal Criminology and Public Policy, Skeem and her co-authors, Lina Montoya and Christopher Lowenkamp, examined probation officers' decision-making in pretrial reports for 149,815 defendants across 81 federal court districts in the U.S. These reports contained troves of information about the defendants' criminal histories, personal finances and social lives, among other things. They each also included a recommendation from the officer\u2014usually upheld by a judge\u2014about whether the defendant should be held in custody or released before trial.Black defendants were 34% more likely to be recommended to be held behind bars until their cases were resolved, researchers found. Racial biases on the part of the officers writing the reports contributed to some of the disparities\u2014particularly in cases that involved a lot of discretion, like when the defendants had little or no criminal record. However, focusing exclusively on things like implicit bias training \"would leave most of the problem unaddressed,\" Skeem said.The vast majority of the racial disparity in detention recommendations operated through pretrial policies and guidelines, which are part of what Skeem called \"institutionalized factors\" that officers were instructed to consider. While those factors included things like the current offense and the person's ties to the community, the biggest factor was the defendant's criminal history.Approximately 70% of the racial disparities observed in pretrial detention recommendations were traced to just that one policy-relevant consideration.\"By far,\" Skeem said, \"the pathway through which most of those racial disparities were operating was criminal history alone.\"      Why criminal history matters \u2026 to a pointLittle is off the table in an officer's far-ranging pretrial risk assessment interview. The officer asks about the defendant's residence, family ties, foreign connections, employment status, education, finances, physical and mental health, substance abuse and gambling. Their report also details the person's criminal history\u2014from assault cases to traffic tickets.To be sure, criminal histories are heavily emphasized because they are often the best predictor for future offenses, Skeem said. But a person's record often becomes a laundry list of offenses that may have nothing to do with the most recent allegation\u2014a speeding ticket from 10 years ago, for example, as a sign of a person's chances of committing a drug offense today. Additionally, offenses are often featured repeatedly in the same pretrial risk report, amounting to double or triple counting of the same incident.This kitchen-sink approach to risk disproportionately affects Black defendants, Skeem said.\"Criminal history belongs in a report and must be acknowledged, but ideally, the focus would be on a few predictive factors that are presented once,\" Skeem said. \"This is a heavily policy-related story. Changing some of the policy guidance and tools for pretrial decision-making will provide the greatest gains in reducing disparities.\"That's why Skeem and her colleagues said they advocate for \"corralling criminal history.\"This could entail using a narrow set of past offenses that are most predictive of committing new crimes. It also requires acknowledging the \"shelf life\" of a past offense, which might not be remotely helpful in understanding the defendant's risk today. And on a technical level, reining in how often such a history can be referenced in a report could ensure it isn't overused, Skeem said.\"Trying to corral criminal history\u2014to adopt a tighter definition\u2014would probably make a bigger dent in disparities than tackling implicit or personal biases,\" Skeem said, adding that it would also improve the likelihood of more accurately achieving the original goal of meaningfully predicting risk.Pretrial racial disparities vary across the U.S.\r The research team's second paper, published in the journal Federal Probation, shows significant geographical variation between the Black and white pretrial disparities. The greatest disparities in the U.S. appeared in districts in the Northeast and the Midwest.Given the progressive politics of the region, that might seem counterintuitive, Skeem said.\"It's not the stereotypical places that you would expect to find the greatest disparities,\" she said. \"It's not in the South or in areas that we are accustomed to thinking of as associated with racism.\"The true explanation is likely that broader structural inequality and deep-seated economic vulnerability are closely linked with involvement in the criminal justice system.\"In places where pretrial disparities are bundled with broader indices of racialized social inequality,\" the researchers wrote, \"it is essential to also address 'root causes' of involvement in crime that include socioeconomic disadvantage, educational and job opportunities, and more.\"In other words, they said, pretrial reform cannot alone address any \"true differences in risk that lie further upstream.\"An innovative data set and collaborationFinding safe and smart ways to decrease the number of people held in custody awaiting their cases' resolution is more than just a passion project for advocates and progressives.Jails are among the most expensive line items that taxpayers finance every year. Severe staffing shortages are common, as are dangerous\u2014sometimes unconstitutional\u2014conditions. And pretrial detention is profoundly disruptive and has been shown to cause ripple effects that can cost legally innocent people their jobs, paychecks and housing.In theory, county jails are a gateway to a similar system of justice for defendants. In effect, however, they're like hundreds of silos operating with their own rules across the country\u2014a reality that makes meaningful research on incarceration data a herculean task.That's what makes Skeem's latest projects especially noteworthy.Skeem partnered with a team at the U.S. Administrative Office of the Courts, where in-house researchers have worked for years to capture reliable criminal justice data from federal court districts across the country. Federal offenders are held in local jails run by the county, but their cases are managed through a nationwide database. That brings a degree of consistency to the federal pretrial detention reports, whether they're being conducted in California or Alabama.A committee within the federal courts' Probation and Pretrial Services System had been working to better address disparities, and it tapped Skeem and Montoya, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, to help analyze the data.\"It's rare to be able to work with an agency that has such complete and relatively clean data,\" Skeem said. \"We're the only outside researchers that got to work with that group from the beginning to figure out what the best questions would be to ask of their really rich data.\"Lowenkamp, a researcher who works with the courts, also helped lead the project.The research team was also able to leverage the institutional knowledge from officers and chiefs to inform how policies might be changed\u2014all the way down to how pretrial risk assessment and report instructions could be modified to create a more equitable outcome. The co-authors believe theirs is the first study to map the personal and institutional influences on racial disparities in officers' recommendations for pretrial detention in the U.S. justice system.Combined, Skeem said the reports can help signal a path forward for finding responsible ways to safely overhaul pretrial detention. Pretrial reform alone won't solve the problem, but using increasingly sophisticated methods, early research shows, can help move in that direction.\"The priority goal,\" the researchers wrote, \"is to first do less harm by eliminating unnecessary detention.\" More information:Jennifer Skeem et al, Understanding racial disparities in pretrial detention recommendations to shape policy reform, Criminology & Public Policy (2023).

  "text": "Students in Sweden are positive towards AI tools such as ChatGPT in education, but 62% believe that using chatbots during exams is cheating. However, where the boundary for cheating lies is highly unclear. This is shown in a survey from Chalmers University of Technology, which is the first large-scale study in Europe to investigate students' attitudes towards artificial intelligence in higher education.          \"I am afraid of AI and what it could mean for the future.\"\"Don't worry so much! Keep up with the development and adapt your teaching for the future.\"\"ChatGPT and similar tools will revolutionize how we learn, and we will be able to come up with amazing things.\"These are three out of nearly 2,000 optional comments from the survey which almost 6,000 students in Sweden recently participated in.\"The students express strong, diverse, and in many cases emotionally charged opinions,\" says Hans Malmstr\u00f6m, Professor at the Department of Communication and Learning in Science at Chalmers University of technology. He, together with his colleagues Christian St\u00f6hr and Amy Wanyu Ou, conducted the study.A majority of the respondents believe that chatbots and AI language tools make them more efficient as students and argue that such tools improve their academic writing and overall language skills. Virtually all the responding students are familiar with ChatGPT, the majority use the tool, and 35% use the chatbot regularly.Despite their positive attitude towards AI, many students feel anxious and lack clear guidance on how to use AI in the learning environments they are in. It is simply difficult to know where the boundary for cheating lies.\"Most students have no idea whether their educational institution has any rules or guidelines for using AI responsibly, and that is of course worrying. At the same time, an overwhelming majority is against a ban on AI in educational contexts,\" says Hans Malmstr\u00f6m.Many students perceive chatbots as a mentor or teacher that they can ask questions or get help from, for example, with explanations of concepts and summaries of ideas. The dominant attitude is that chatbots should be used as an aid, not replace students' own critical thinking. Or as one student put it: \"You should be able to do the same things as the AI, but it should help you do it. You should not use a calculator if you don't know what the plus sign on it does.\"Another important aspect that emerged in the survey was that AI serves as an effective aid for people with various disabilities. A student with ADD and dyslexia described how they had spent 20 minutes writing down their answer in the survey and then improved it by inputting the text into ChatGPT: \"It's like being color blind and suddenly being able to see all the beautiful colors.\"The researchers have now gathered a wealth of important information and compiled the results in an overview report.\"We hope and believe that the answers from this survey will give students a voice and the results will thus be an important contribution to our collective understanding of AI and learning,\" says Christian St\u00f6hr, Associate Professor at the Department of Communication and Learning in Science at Chalmers.More about the study \"Chatbots and other AI for learning: A survey on use and views among university students in Sweden\" was conducted in the following way: The researchers at Chalmers conducted the survey between April 5 and May 5, 2023. Students at all universities in Sweden could participate. The survey was distributed through social media and targeted efforts from multiple universities and student organizations. In total, the survey was answered by 5,894 students.Summary of results95% of students are familiar with ChatGPT, while awareness of other chatbots is very low.56% are positive about using chatbots in their studies; 35% use ChatGTP regularly.60% are opposed to a ban on chatbots, and 77% are against a ban on other AI tools (such as Grammarly) in education.More than half of the students do not know if their institution has guidelines for how AI can be used in education; one in four explicitly says that their institution lack such regulations.62% believe that using chatbots during examinations is cheating.Students express some concern about AI development, and there is particular concern over the impact of chatbots on future education.For more information, please contact: Provided byChalmers University of TechnologyCitation:Students positive toward AI, but uncertain about what counts as cheating, finds survey (2023, May 11)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-students-positive-ai-uncertain-survey.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_squad": " more than half",
  "text": "As the cost of living continues to spiral, a new report shows more than half of gig economy workers in the UK are paid below the minimum wage.          The first-of-its-kind study, led by the University of Bristol, found 52% of gig workers doing jobs ranging from data entry to food delivery were earning below the minimum wage. On average respondents were earning \u00a38.97 per hour\u2014around 15% below the current UK minimum wage, which rose to \u00a310.42 this month.More than three-quarters (76%) of survey respondents also experienced work-related insecurity and anxiety.Lead author Dr. Alex Wood, Senior Lecturer in Human Resource Management and Future of Work at the University of Bristol Business School, said, \"The findings highlight that working in the UK gig economy often entails low pay, anxiety, and stress. As food, fuel and housing costs keep rising, this group of workers are especially vulnerable and need to be more adequately remunerated and better protected.\"Equally concerning, more than a quarter (28%) felt they were risking their health or safety in doing gig work and a quarter (25%) experienced pain on the job.When asked what would improve their situation, basic rights such as minimum wage rates, holiday and sick pay, and protection against unfair dismissal were most wanted.Unions and platform councils (similar to works councils that exist in some European countries) to represent their needs and help influence how gig economy platforms operate and affect their working conditions also featured on their wish list. More than three-quarters of respondents believed the introduction of such bodies would bring immediate benefits.Dr. Wood said, \"A major factor contributing to low pay rates is that this work involves spending significant amounts of time waiting or looking for work while logged on to a platform. Not only is the work low paid, but it is also extremely insecure and risky.\"The self-employed who are dependent on platforms to make a living are urgently in need of labor protections to shield them against the huge power asymmetries that exist in the sector. This clearly warrants the expansion of the current 'worker' status to protect them.\"The study involved 510 UK gig economy workers who were surveyed last year. There was representation from across the sector, with around half being remote freelancers using platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr to pick up jobs ranging from data entry to website design. The other half comprised local drivers providing food delivery and taxi services via platforms including Deliveroo and Uber.More than just side hustles to earn extra cash, respondents spent on average 28 hours a week undertaking gig work, comprising 60% of their total earnings.Respondents overwhelmingly considered their work to be best described as self-employment and thought an extension of labor rights to include the self-employed would significantly improve their working lives.This was the first research to investigate what forms of voice gig workers want. The findings suggest strong support for European style co-determination whereby worker representatives are consulted on and approve changes that impact working conditions and employment. Works councils that exist in countries like Germany could therefore provide a model for platform councils and assemblies in the gig economy to facilitate workers having a say over the decisions which affect their ability to make a living.Brendan Burchell, Professor in Social Sciences at the University of Cambridge and co-author of the report, added, \"Respondents strongly felt the creation of co-determination mechanisms would allow workers, and their representatives, to influence platform provider decisions which could instantly improve their working lives.\"These policies include elected bodies of worker representatives approving all major platform changes that impact jobs and working conditions. Our findings emphasize the potential for trade union growth in this sector, with majorities being willing to join and even organize such bodies.\" Provided byUniversity of BristolCitation:UK report reveals majority of gig economy workers are earning below minimum wage (2023, May 10)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-uk-reveals-majority-gig-economy.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "A market for an expanded grocery selection at dollar stores potentially exists, especially with consumers who live less than 10 minutes away, according to data reported in the April Consumer Food Insights report.          The survey-based report out of Purdue University's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability assesses food spending, consumer satisfaction and values, support of agricultural and food policies, and trust in information sources. Purdue experts conducted and evaluated the survey, which included 1,200 consumers across the U.S.April's report assesses differences in food behaviors by food security status rather than demographics. The report includes the first questions center researchers have asked about consumer behavior and food selection at dollar stores.\"More than half of Americans have recently shopped at a dollar store,\" said Jayson Lusk, the head and Distinguished Professor of Agricultural Economics at Purdue, who leads the center. \"When it comes to food, many of these purchases are snack items. If consumers do pick up more food at a dollar store, it makes sense that people typically buy canned or frozen foods since these are the easiest options for dollar stores to stock.\"While only a small percentage of consumers shop for groceries at dollar stores, there could be a market for an expanded food selection since 50% of those surveyed reported that a full-service grocery would be a draw.\"Plus, nearly 60% of consumers say that they live within 10 minutes of a dollar store, which has potential for capitalizing on access issues,\" Lusk said.In the food spending category, the slow easing of food inflation continues. Data from this summer's reports will provide a helpful picture of how consumers are doing.\"If people go out and spend more at bars and restaurants, as one would expect, then we could say that consumers are feeling fairly confident,\" Lusk said. \"But if food away from home spending does not increase in our data, especially as food away from home inflation continues to pick up according to official measures, then we might have some questions.\"Lacking pre-January 2022 survey data, the Purdue researchers are unable to compare current responses to times of low inflation. Even so, Lusk said, \"It seems that consumers have some degree of elevated inflation baked into their expectations with their 4.3% estimation of future inflation.\"                Frequency the Consumer Choose the Organic Food Option, April 2023. Credit: Purdue University Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability             Additional key results include the following:Total food spending is up 7% from this time last year, while consumers similarly estimate annual food inflation to be about 7%.Vegetables and fruits are the most popular organic items, but less than a third of consumers often or always choose organic. The food behaviors of food-secure and -insecure households differ relatively little on many common shopping choices. Still, it is important to recognize the differences that do exist between the households, said Sam Polzin, a food and agriculture survey scientist for the center and co-author of the report.\"Those facing very low food security are in a more precarious place,\" Polzin said. \"Over 40% rely on food aid and over 80% report effectively living paycheck to paycheck with regards to food purchasing. They also have a much more negative view toward their own diets, which we might expect would have a cumulative negative effect on overall well-being. They eat at home more often, prefer generic brands, and aren't buying more expensive products like wild-caught fish or organics as much.\"In some ways, however, Polzin adds, \"Food behaviors between food-secure and -insecure households don't differ as much as we might expect or differ in ways we might not expect.\"For example, people in food-insecure households garden at a higher rate. They are just as likely to buy local foods or check for natural food labels and appear to compost more often.April's report also includes a section on how often Americans choose the organic option. These data broadly help show that fruits and vegetables are the most popular organic category.\"Since organics are not purchased that often, we can say that people are likely overstating how often they select these foods,\" Polzin noted. \"Since organics have one of the largest halos with regards to nutrition, naturalness and the environment, social desirability bias is probably a common factor contributing to this phenomenon.\" More information:Survey results: ag.purdue.edu/cfdas/resource-l \u2026 -issue-4-april-2023/Provided byPurdue UniversityCitation:Report explores role of dollar stores in food landscape (2023, May 10)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-explores-role-dollar-food-landscape.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "question_race": " What is the main idea of the passage?",
  "answer_race": " Climate change is a hot topic in Florida.",
  "question_squad": " What percentage of Floridians believe climate change is happening?",
  "answer_squad": " 90 percent",
  "text": "An increasing number of Floridians agree that human actions are causing climate change, including a record number of Florida Republicans, according to a new survey from Florida Atlantic University. This finding reinforces the trend observed in the prior seven Florida Climate Resilience Surveys, conducted by FAU's Center for Environmental Studies within the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science.          Three main messages emerge from this latest poll. First, climate change is no longer an effective partisan wedge issue. Virtually all respondents (90 percent) believe climate change is happening, with 65 percent attributing the causes to human actions, including 49 percent of GOP voters. This belief is leading to concern for the future: 61 percent of Floridians are moderately-to-extremely concerned about flooding worsening due to climate change, and 68 percent are moderately-to-extremely concerned about hurricanes worsening due to climate change.Second, this belief in and concern about human-caused climate change appears to be translating into support for policies to reduce emissions and reduce impacts. For example, a majority of Floridians (52 percent) support a hypothetical $10/month tax to strengthen Florida's infrastructure to weather hazards.Younger Democrats and Republicans are leading this trend, with 64 percent of GOP or Democratic voters under age 35 in support. In addition, 71 percent of Floridians currently support the teaching of climate change causes and impacts in public K-12 classrooms. Finally, the Aug. 16, 2022 Federal Inflation Reduction Act enjoys broad support (55 percent) in Florida, with only 16 percent opposed.Third, the explanation for this emerging consensus may be grounded in people's lived experiences with weather events. The preceding hurricane season included two major storms impacting Florida. Hurricane Ian made landfall on Sept. 23, 2022 in Southwest Florida, and Nicole on Nov. 7, 2022 on Florida's East coast.According to NOAA, both storms caused significant financial and physical damage, totaling more than $112 billion and an estimated 157 deaths. Approximately three-quarters (77 percent) of Floridians have been exposed to at least one weather hazard in the past 12 months. Almost half of respondents (47 percent) were impacted by flooding in the last 12 months, and an even greater proportion (67 percent) by strong winds from hurricanes or tornadoes.The survey was conducted in English and Spanish on March 14. The sample consisted of 1,400 Floridians, age 18 and older, with a survey margin of error of +/- 2.62 percentage points. The data were collected using an online panel provided by GreatBlue Research. Responses for the entire sample were weighted to adjust for age, race, income, education and gender, according to the 2020 United States Bureau of the Census American Community Surveys. It is important to remember that subsets carry higher margins of error.

  "answer_squad": " Professional understanding of the difference between typical variation and errors in the language system",
  "text": "African American English (AAE) is a variety of English spoken primarily, though not exclusively, by Black Americans of historical African descent.          Because AAE varies from white American English (WAE) in a systematic way, it is possible that speech and hearing specialists unfamiliar with the language variety could misidentify differences in speech production as speech disorder. Professional understanding of the difference between typical variation and errors in the language system is the first step for accurately identifying disorder and establishing linguistic justice for AAE speakers.In her presentation, \"Kids talk too: Linguistic justice and child African American English,\" Yolanda Holt of East Carolina University described aspects of the systematic variation between AAE and WAE speech production in children. The talk took place Wednesday, May 10 as part of the 184th Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America.Common characteristics of AAE speech include variation at all linguistic levels, from sound production at the word level to the choice of commentary in professional interpersonal interactions. A frequent feature of AAE is final consonant reduction/deletion and final consonant cluster reduction. Holt provided the following example to illustrate word level to interpersonal level linguistic variation.\"In the professional setting, if one AAE-speaking professional woman wanted to compliment the attire of the other, the exchange might sound something like this: [Speaker 1] 'I see you rockin' the tone on tone.' [Speaker 2] 'Frien', I'm jus' tryin' to be like you wit' the fully executive flex.'\"This example, in addition to using common aspects of AAE word shape, shows how the choice to use AAE in a professional setting is a way for the two women to share a message beyond the words.\"This exchange illustrates a complex and nuanced cultural understanding between the two speakers. In a few words, they communicate professional respect and a subtle appreciation for the intricate balance that African American women navigate in bringing their whole selves to the corporate setting,\" said Holt.Holt and her team examined final consonant cluster reduction (e.g., expressing \"shift\" as \"shif'\") in 4- and 5-year-old children. Using instrumental acoustic phonetic analysis, they discovered that the variation in final consonant production in AAE is likely not a wholesale elimination of word endings but is perhaps a difference in aspects of articulation.\"This is an important finding because it could be assumed that if a child does not fully articulate the final sound, they are not aware of its existence,\" said Holt. \"By illustrating that the AAE-speaking child produces a variation of the final sound, not a wholesale removal, we help to eliminate the mistaken idea that AAE speakers don't know the ending sounds exist.\"Holt believes the fields of speech and language science, education, and computer science should expect and accept such variation in human communication. Linguistic justice occurs when we accept variation in human language without penalizing the user or defining their speech as \"wrong.\"\"Language is alive. It grows and changes over each generation,\" said Holt. \"Accepting the speech and language used by each generation and each group of speakers is an acceptance of the individual, their life, and their experience. Acceptance, not tolerance, is the next step in the march towards linguistic justice. For that to occur, we must learn from our speakers and educate our professionals that different can be typical. It is not always disordered.\" Provided byAcoustical Society of AmericaCitation:Achieving linguistic justice for African American English (2023, May 10)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-linguistic-justice-african-american-english.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_squad": " Scopus",
  "text": "A new study led by City, University of London suggests that the introduction of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) to measure the research performance of UK universities has led to significant increases in the quantity of their high-quality published research, but not in the output of active academics, and that it must do more to support university research strategies.          Many countries around the world use performance-based research systems (PRFS) as a means of determining the distribution of funding for research across higher education institutions. In 2008, the REF replaced Research Assessment Exercises (RAE) as the measurement of this across UK universities, with the first results in 2014 to cover the period between 2009 and 2014.The research by Giulia Iori and Albert Banal-Esta\u00f1ol, Professors in Economics at City, alongside academics from Universitat de Barcelona, London School of Economics and Political Science and University of Palermo, investigated the performance of institutions and the incremental effects of REF2014 on output and quality of the research submitted across UK universities in contrast with comparable institutions in the United States, which are not exposed to such a measure.The sample included 103 UK universities that submitted research to REF2014's 'Economics and Econometrics' panel or 'Business and Management' panel. As a control group, 135 US universities with a top-quartile Department of Economics or Business School according to the Research Papers in Economics (RePEc) database from December 2018.Key findings from the research include:REF2014 significantly increased UK universities' research output compared to US institutions, but the number of publications per author did not grow with it. This suggests the REF generally encouraged universities to hire more academics to increase activity rather than supporting their existing researchers to produce a higher volume of work.Subsequently, the number of UK university publications increased on average per department by 41.37 percent across the time period, with the most pronounced change taking place towards the end of the cycle, between 2012 and 2014.Research excellence\u2014measured by publications in top journals (3*, 4* and 4** journals as measured by Association of Business Schools' classification of scientific journals)\u2014also increased relative to other countries following implementation of REF.Increases in research output for REF2014 were generally more pronounced for Russell Group universities than non-Russell Group ones, with a stronger positive impact from REF2014 in terms of number of top publications per author.Submissions from universities that selected the Economics and Econometrics RAE2008 panel but switched to the Business and Management panel for REF2014 were significantly decreased compared to those that remained with the same panel. Consequently, their proportion of business publications in top journals did not increase.Researchers used Scopus, the largest worldwide database of peer-reviewed literature, to obtain all articles that included at least one of the 103 UK universities or 135 US universities as an affiliation, had either 'Economics, Econometrics and Finance' or 'Business Management and Accounting' as subject areas, and were published between 2001 and 2014. Institutions submitting fewer than ten papers per year on average between 2001 and 2008 were discarded from the overall sample size, which totaled 145,536 unique publications.Professor Iori said the study suggested REF needed to do more to encourage universities to invest in processes and supportive strategies.\"The Research Excellence Framework is an important tool for universities to be able to attract funding, recruit students and increase their national and global prestige,\" she said.\"When compared to US universities, our data shows that the REF incites a higher number of research publications and articles published in the best journals. However, given the number of publications per author remained stable throughout the research period, this appears to be driven by institutions hiring more academics rather than an intrinsic motivator for academics themselves to publish in leading journals. This recruitment is simply a redistribution of academics rather than an enhancement of research capacity.\"\"Ultimately this benefits the elite universities who can attract the best academics, and hurts the lesser ones who are losing them to competitors, but does little to improve overall standards.\"Professor Banal-Esta\u00f1ol agreed that the study highlighted areas of improvement needed in the assessment framework.\"The REF must encourage greater collaboration between domestic competitors, rather than pitting them against each other,\" he said.\"Comparing universities domestically is not highly meaningful as the best ones will always outperform the worst, especially with the polarization of academic redistribution. If too much of a gap exists, this can discourage weaker institutions from producing and submitting research which has an overall detrimental effect.\"\"Instead, the REF needs to reward universities that outperform others on a similar trajectory, rather than pitting strong against weak, which is why international comparisons are much more useful for driving overall standards.\"\"This study provides the basis for alternative measures of success of a performance-based research system, to ensure the fairest means of distributing funds while preserving competition and increasing overall standards.\" More information:Albert Banal-Esta\u00f1ol et al, Performance-based research funding: Evidence from the largest natural experiment worldwide, Research Policy (2023).

  "text": "While often large research teams are able to generate more impact, they struggle to reach top-tier journals, finds a new study from the University of Surrey that analyzed data from 1.4 million academic papers. The paper is published in the journal Academy of Management Learning & Education.          Professor Sorin Krammer, lead author of the study and Professor of Strategy and International Business at the University of Surrey, said, \"Despite the prevalence of large teams in research, there is still a lack of a good understanding of how their size and diversity affects their performance.\"\"Our findings will help academics, and perhaps industry, to organize teams more effectively according to their performance goals.\"The Surrey study used data between the years 1990 and 2020 on more than 1.4 million papers and 18 million citation counts across 22 subfields in management.The authors of the study captured performance in two distinct areas: impact, in the form of citations gathered by a research paper, and prestige, in the form of ranking of the journal where it is published. Furthermore, they looked at diversity in terms of knowledge expertise and international representation.The authors discovered that neither the size, nor the characteristics of teams uniformly affected research performance, and highlighted that academics should be cautious in thinking that larger, more technically diverse teams are better.Professor Krammer said, \"We also found a lower success rate for single-authored papers. Often, it takes single authors a huge amount of time, resources, expertise, and effort to develop such research papers that inherently have much lower success rates and impact, therefore, the requirement by many schools to have such single-authored top publications as a prerequisite for tenure, promotion or career advancement seems unnecessary and unfair.\"While both larger and more diverse teams are independently beneficial to research performance, in extreme scenarios (i.e., very large and very diverse teams), researchers found that this combination reduces the impact of research, noting fewer citations.

It's part of UMD's Applied Research Laboratory for Intelligence and Security's (ARLIS) Emotions in Social Media Project, a multidisciplinary research effort to examine how different emotions influence the spread of information campaigns.\"It's fun, but it's not frivolous,\" said Susannah Paletz, associate professor in the College of Information Studies and principal investigator. \"As enjoyable as it is to discover in your Twitter feed, we know cuteness is also used to deliberately manipulate your feelings. And it works.\"The \"cute\" study offers 15 quantifiable attributes, including visual characteristics, behavior and linguistic cues, to create what researchers call a Cuteness Attributes Taxonomy. In the study, published in Frontiers in Psychology, trained annotators pored over 1,800 social posts and assigned codes to images or strings of words, from baby behavior to high-pitched voices, while also separately measuring annotators' emotional responses.\"It's a time-consuming process, but one that results in gold-standard data,\" said Ewa Golonka, associate research scientist at ARLIS, who also serves as the team's task publications lead on this topic.

DOI: 10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1068373             The team hopes to use its data to examine whether an onslaught of concentrated cuteness predicts user engagement in social media, like the number of shares, comments or likes; this research includes emotion evoked by cute content, for which they also developed measures. Research on a broader emotional spectrum\u201423 discrete emotions with fuzzy boundaries identified by the team, from disgust to wonder\u2014and how patterns of emotions influence social media sharing, is also underway.Below, Golonka and Paletz discuss the anatomy of cute, why it matters and the dumpster-diving-cat-turned-labor-activist that became a viral sensation:What makes something cute? Is there a recipe for achieving ultimate cuteness?Golonka: Yes, there's a whole list that we can refer to when determining if something is cute. The main one is called \"baby schema\": large head, chubby cheeks, small nose and a round body shape combined with cute behavior, like clumsy movements or being helpless and vulnerable. There's cute talk, with a high pitch or certain vocabulary.Also, there's a concept called cuteness by contrast, where the sense of cuteness is created by contrasting attributes, like a gorilla with a baby. And there are also features that make cute objects even cuter; for example, cute animals interacting is cuter than if they don't interact.      What sort of implications does this research have for society, but also for things like disinformation and national security?Golonka: We know that cuteness affects people's brains, emotions and behaviors. So, all of this can have huge implications. We know that individuals and organizations draw on cute content to persuade: for example, to buy products, convey public service announcements, donate money by creating empathy and compassion, even reduce meat consumption.Paletz: This does have national security implications. Years ago, ISIS was using kittens to soften their persona and help with recruitment. More recently, animals have made their way into anti-Russian social posts out of Ukraine, including cats dressed in military uniforms.What is your favorite example of an organization using 'cuteness' to forward an agenda?Paletz: In 2021, a Reddit thread went viral about an \"office\" cat named Jorts and attempts to train him by employees. He was portrayed as this lovable but not terribly smart cat who was constantly getting into scrapes, and who ultimately was at the center of a workplace incident that involved Human Resources.Eventually, the person behind the thread launched a Twitter account for Jorts that's told from the cat's perspective. But what's happened over time is it's become this great mix of cute cat tweets and a powerful platform for labor activism. It's amazing.Do you have any tips for people who want to ramp up the cuteness of their social posts?Golonka: It's about building as many layers of cuteness as possible. Mine would be a bunch of baby goats in pajamas running around and playing together. Then add some cute talk and an emoji\u2026 and then sprinkle your message somewhere. And you are good to go.If cuteness can be used nefariously, can we ever trust a baby animal post again?Paletz: One of the big takeaways from our work is that there is a lot of really toxic discourse and a lot of anger and hate on social media; so even if cuteness is used deliberately to manipulate\u2014like when ISIS poses with kittens\u2014it's nicer than the alternative.

  "text": "The geochemistry of copper artifacts reveals changes in distribution networks across prehistoric Europe, according to a study published May 10, 2023, in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Jan Piet Brozio of Kiel University, Germany, and colleagues.          Early copper artifacts are considered to have a high cultural and historical significance in European prehistory, but limited information exists about how copper was used and distributed in Neolithic Europe. In this study, the authors analyzed 45 copper objects, including axes, chisels, and other items, from various sites dating to the 4th and 3rd millennia BC of Northern Central Europe and Southern Scandinavia.The researchers examined the lead isotopic signature of the copper objects to link them to previously sampled sources of ore around the European continent. Their data indicate that artifacts from before 3500 BC derived exclusively from mines in southeast Europe, especially Serbian mining areas, while later artifacts include ores from the eastern Alps and Slovak Mountains and, much later, potentially the British Isles. Their results also indicate fluctuations in metallurgic activity over time, including a decrease in the prevalence of copper artifacts around 3000 BC.These changes in the origins and availability of copper likely reflect differences in distribution networks through time, probably influenced by changing economies, social structures, communication networks, and technologies across prehistoric Europe. Further study of the sources and uses of copper artifacts will enhance our understanding of how metal goods were produced and distributed around the continent in the past.The authors add, \"Based on lead isotope analyses of the largest sample to date of Neolithic copper objects from southern Scandinavia and northern Germany, the study proves that the exchange of metallic objects connected Europe over long distances. However, the introduction of new technologies and materials alone did not lead to social changes; their integration required deliberate choices by societies.\" More information:The origin of Neolithic copper on the central Northern European plain and in Southern Scandinavia: Connectivities on a European scale, PLOS ONE (2023).

  "answer_squad": " 6,000 gallons of water per month",
  "text": "A new analysis suggests that about one in seven households across the U.S. may face financial hardship in paying for access to water and wastewater services. Lauren Patterson and colleagues at Duke University, North Carolina, present these findings in the open-access journal PLOS Water.          U.S. households pay utilities for access to water for drinking, cooking, cleaning, and sanitation, as well as for wastewater services. However, in recent years, the cost of these services has increased alongside a widening income gap, fueling affordability concerns. Addressing these concerns requires a clear understanding of water affordability challenges across the U.S.To help clarify, Patterson and colleagues analyzed the affordability of water services for households served by 787 of the largest water utilities in the nation. They assessed the number of households spending more than 4.6% of their monthly income\u2014about one workday's worth of pay\u2014on 6,000 gallons of water per month, which is considered sufficient to meet basic household needs.The researchers found that a total of 17% of all households in the study\u2014covering about 28.3 million people\u2014spent more than 4.6% of their income on water services. A median of 15% of households, or one in seven, faced this level of water unaffordability.Households that might struggle to afford water services were located across all states and regions of the U.S., even when considering particularly conservative definitions of affordability. This study focused on larger water systems and did not consider smaller water systems serving communities of fewer than 1,000 people, which have higher costs, suggesting that even more households might struggle to afford basic water services than captured in the analysis.The researchers also note that the drivers of water unaffordability are varied and complex, including factors such as aging infrastructure, climate change, and low household incomes. They suggest that solutions to boost affordability may therefore require comprehensive strategies at the local, state, and federal scales.To aid such efforts and empower the public, the researchers developed an interactive online tool that shows how water affordability changes depending on location, usage rates, and definition of affordability.The authors summarize, \"An analysis including nearly half the U.S. population estimated 17% of households may struggle to afford their drinking water and sanitation services.\" More information:Affordability of household water services across the United States, PLOS Water (2023).

  "answer_squad": " panic buying",
  "text": "We all remember 2020. At the grocery store, toilet paper shelves were empty. Cleaning supplies and disinfectants were treasured finds. Rattled consumers, concerned that they would run out of essential items, swiftly stockpiled products until they disappeared from shelves. In the media, it was referred to as \"panic buying.\"          Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Jose Holguin-Veras, William H. Hart Chair Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering and director of the Center for Infrastructure, Transportation, and the Environment (CITE), contends that this was a misnomer.\"Disaster-related buying behaviors or DRBBs is a more accurate phrase than panic buying,\" Holguin-Veras said. \"Panic refers to extreme fear that causes someone to act irrationally, which negates the possibility to reason with these individuals to change their purchasing behaviors.\"Instead, in research recently published, Holgu\u00edn-Veras and team collected surveys in dozens of countries and found that, in the U.S., the top three themes were: precaution (25.79%), the anticipation of needs (22.63%) to avoid the possibility of regret if they didn't make the purchases (16.39%), and their interpretation of the actions of others, or social cues (13.44%).They found that the key to altering consumer behavior to maintain adequate supply levels is trusted change agents, or TCAs. TCAs refer to the representatives of groups active in disaster perceived to be knowledgeable and trustworthy such as the Red Cross, national/state/local emergency responders, firefighters, and national/state/local health officials, that can reach large numbers of people, understand the need to influence the individuals that enact \"panic buying,\" and are willing to act. A whopping 89% of people said that they would limit their purchases if asked by a TCA.A typical food distribution center has two days worth of supplies. The research team found in their survey that, of the households that engaged in DRBBs, 80% increased their inventories by a week and a half!\"Managing demand is essential because modern supply chains rarely have the ability to quickly increase production and distribution of essential items,\" said Holguin-Veras.Peoples' objectives in DRBBs ran the gamut. First, self-preservation was a primary concern. Second, altruism factored in as consumers wanted to provide for their loved ones and their communities. Third, opportunism reared its head, as people tried to cash in on opportunities to sell hard-to-find items at a premium. With this in mind, a one-size-fits-all approach will not work.\"Managing DRBBs requires effective public-private-humanitarian collaboration,\" said Holguin-Veras. \"The public sector has the legal authority to intervene when needed, the private sector has control over the access and supplies, and the humanitarian sector has the deep community connections.\"The sectors must work together in preparation, response, and assessment. Building trust and relationships, monitoring events and identifying situations that could prompt DRBBs, and examining legal frameworks are priorities during the preparation phase.During response, demand should be managed by working with private- and humanitarian- sector representatives, TCAs should be engaged, opportunistic purchases should be controlled to foster equitable access, and rationing should be instituted if needed. Appeals for the donations of stockpiled supplies are another measure that can be taken. Finally, a comprehensive assessment would facilitate any needed improvements.\"Dr. Holguin-Veras' work continues to enrich our understanding and ability to respond during disasters and emergencies,\" said Shekhar Garde, dean of Rensselaer's School of Engineering. \"His work shows that for solving complex interconnected challenges, understanding of human factors is as important as technological solutions. I hope that these findings will inform strategies to avoid supply shortages in the future.\"The work is published in the journal Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives.

  "text": "One of the Writers Guild of America's demands in its current strike is for studios to regulate the use of artificial intelligence for creating, writing and rewriting TV and movie scripts and other material.          That might have sounded like a far-fetched concern just a few years ago. But with increasingly sophisticated, easily accessed AI tools already making inroads in other creative fields\u2014literary magazines and fine arts competitions have lately had to contend with a glut of AI-generated submissions\u2014there is a very real concern that expensive, time-intensive human creative labor could soon be outsourced to machines.Higher education has reached an inflection point, too, now that AI tools can pass graduate-level exams and write serviceable essays at the touch of a button. Already, UCLA has posted a faculty guide and held a virtual town hall on the subject.\"We in the humanities have long thought about these kinds of questions, especially at the experimental limits of what constitutes creativity,\" said Danny Snelson, a UCLA assistant professor of English and a writer, editor and archivist. \"Lately I've been thinking about this artwork by Robert Rauschenberg from 1961 in which he sent a one-line telegram: 'This Is a Portrait of Iris Clert if I Say So.' It's a perfect rejoinder to where some of the debates about creativity and AI are right now.\"Jacob Foster is a UCLA associate professor of sociology, computational social scientist and co-director of the Diverse Intelligences Summer Institute, which unites scholars to explore cognition in all forms. He also has pondered the revolution that appears to be unfolding.\"Something terrible and amazing is about to happen, but no one has a full idea what these systems are capable of\u2014or an entirely clear picture of how they do the things that they do,\" he said.In a joint interview, Foster and Snelson spoke about how chatbots could be used in teaching, offered historic analogs for the current AI explosion and opined about whether technology is actually capable of creativity. Answers have been edited slightly for length and clarity.Are you excited or concerned about where AI is headed\u2014or both?Jacob Foster: I'm excited, given my broad interest in how complex wholes become smarter than their parts. I agree with the school of thought that says AI creates opportunities to get at a more fundamental understanding of\u2014and clarity about\u2014things like intelligence and creativity.Danny Snelson: I'm tremendously excited watching these developments unfold, but in a physiological sense\u2014an excited state of fight or flight. Things are moving faster than we can understand them. These developments change things in ways that matter. The effects of algorithmic bias are real and the harms of technological development are never equally distributed.Foster: To that point, I recently asked ChatGPT to write short plays about the nature of creativity. Until I explicitly told it that the expert on creativity had to be a woman, it always came up with a story about a singular male genius interacting with a female muse or with a female petitioner seeking his advice.When you read the technical report for GPT, they have worked very hard to tamp down on problematic responses\u2014for example, using reinforcement learning with human feedback\u2014but even this neutral prompt resulted in a gender-biased response. AI is a mirror of the things we've written and the stories we've told, and that becomes a much bigger deal when it's potentially determining who gets jobs or certain insurance rates.I'm helping to organize a program at our Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics on the mathematics of intelligences, and trying to develop the theoretical foundations of AI is obviously a big motivation. But there are fascinating additional basic research challenges. I don't think we have the resources within social theory to think about the possible rearrangements of society that such technologies could enable. We don't know how to deal with social change that's happening so quickly and pervasively.      Is AI capable of creativity?Foster: We often reserve the notion of creativity for the capacity to generate interesting, novel things. But the contrarian part of me wants to argue when people say, \"Large language models aren't creative; they're just putting things together.\" Humans do that, too\u2014look at many of the papers produced by students or academics!Snelson: These systems reveal just how formally consistent most writing is. The more generic the formats that these predictive models simulate, the more successful they are. These developments push us to recognize the normative functions of our forms and potentially transform them. After the introduction of photography, which is very good at capturing a representational space, the painterly milieu developed Impressionism, a style that rejected accurate representation altogether to linger with the materiality of paint itself.Foster: I think of the short film \"Sunspring,\" directed by my friend Oscar Sharp, which came out in 2016 and was the first movie written by AI. The script itself is only borderline coherent\u2014this was a much earlier iteration of the technology\u2014but it becomes something much more elevated when interpreted by the human actors, director and viewers.Snelson: William S. Burroughs would cut up different texts and smash them together to produce a kind of surrealist energy. And he said this beautiful thing, which is that by using this cut-up method, you're cutting into the present for the future to leak out. Right now, we have an opportunity to think about these new forms of fluid, coherent, algorithmic writing and how we might cut into them to see what they might reveal.Can ChatGPT actually be an asset in teaching at the university level?Snelson: In my Intro to Comics course, my students collectively wrote a full book in the first week, before they knew anything about the subject, using ChatGPT. I think it's useful for them to experiment with the essay, and then for the rest of the course we instead use comics formats to produce new knowledge about comics.I mean, if you're working on the essay as your subject of study, then definitely get deep into the essay format\u2014but you understand media formats best when you're working with that media directly. Put otherwise, we want our students to use modes of critical thinking to navigate the world around them, which now includes these AI tools. Experimenting and playing with them will prepare students, hopefully, to think critically in a technological environment that's always changing and shifting.Foster: That's a very helpful tonic for the prejudice that the essay is a necessary gym to build the skills we want students to have. It's of a type with my faintly ludicrous \"old person\" attitude that me learning how to use card catalogs made me uniquely capable to deal with the internet age.Snelson: Right now, for example, there's a moral panic in academe about essays. Having taught the fundamentals of argumentation, evidence and rhetoric for over a decade, I can tell you essay writing is not a mysterious formula. The essay has stood strong for a while now; it has limitations that other modes\u2014some of which are still to be invented\u2014may yet be better at when it comes to inspiring students to develop the kind of critical thought needed to address generative algorithms.How will we look back on this moment in time?Snelson: If the history of major technological inventions is any indicator\u2014I'm thinking here of the printing press and the internet\u2014we'll look back at this time as a moment of confusion and flux with a huge amount of widespread misunderstanding, and, hopefully, with unexpected avenues toward a better future.It makes me think of this great anecdote by Rudy Rucker, who helped invent the genre of cyberpunk fiction in the 1980s. At some point, he woke up with this universal computing device in his hand that could access all of human knowledge while still living in the extreme disparities of contemporary America and he realized that a cyberpunk future was already well underway.Foster: In some sense, this is a generalization and acceleration of the experience humans have always had negotiating a world of vast forces far beyond themselves.As folks like the computer scientist Danny Hillis and mathematician Norbert Wiener have remarked, we've been dealing with artificial intelligence for centuries, in the form of corporations and bureaucracies that take human beings as their parts and turn them into vast, impersonal collective machines. Will we be able to tame or resist these new machines? I hope so. Provided byUniversity of California, Los AngelesCitation:Q&A: Can AI and creativity coexist?

  "text": "Climate change is increasingly a major consideration for business leaders as they plan for future investment and work to improve their firm's competitiveness. The private sector, as both a major emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and an important source of innovation, must play an essential role in society's efforts to decarbonize, and ultimately, transition to net zero by 2050.          Research to date on the net zero transition has often focused on the national or sectoral level as a whole. Corporate Strategies for Net Zero, a new initiative of the Ivey Centre for Building Sustainable Value (BSV), explores how individual firms can\u2014and must\u2014make meaningful progress.Establishing a credible path to net zero presents major risks and challenges, but also transformative opportunities for firms to shift or alter their business model, value chain and competitive positioning. Firms can capitalize on these strategic opportunities, such as the possibilities of new products, services and markets, and novel ways of interacting with or serving customers.The first in a series of planned research reports, Corporate Strategies for Net Zero examines the key elements of the new strategic landscape for net zero within a Canadian context. Robert D. Klassen, professor, operations management, and Matthew Lynch, associate director, BSV, explore the main drivers that have compelled companies to take ambitious strategic action in recent years, including:Investor pressure and disclosure requirementsIncreasing policy and regulatory drivers, centered around carbon pricing and mandatory disclosures andA growing set of competitive pressures to match or lead sector peers on climate performance.To aid leadership teams seeking to understand their firm's readiness for making a commitment to reduce GHG emissions, Klassen and Lynch have mapped a pathway identifying overarching strategic questions for firms.Credit: University of Western OntarioThe authors propose four key steps, prompted by critical questions, to map a pathway forward:Rationale: Specify and detail the rationale for committing to and pursuing net zeroDecision-making and accountability: Develop decision-making processes and accountability for progressPartnerships: Pursue novel partnerships beyond traditional value chain partners that potentially expand opportunitiesInnovation: Balance efforts to manage risk with the exploration of and investment in innovative technologies and practices that extend or reshape your business model.\"By mapping out this complexity and beginning to strategically address the four pathway questions, companies can address the strategic issues and implementation plan that must be constructed by executive teams,\" said Klassen.\"Firms cannot simply take modest actions to adjust their existing strategies and operations, but are encouraged to treat this as an opportunity. Leaders must establish a long-term goal and undertake significant credible action now as business models are rethought and reconfigured, which in turn, must prompt new investment in capabilities and partnerships.\"Julia Zeeman, Program Director of the Canadian Business for Social Responsibility (CBSR), said net zero is a key agenda for CBSR's membership, representing many of Canada's corporate climate leaders.\"This report from Ivey provides important clarity on the strategic implications of net zero and identifies the key questions companies need to consider as they position themselves to succeed in the emerging net zero economy,\" she said.For the second phase of this research initiative, Ivey researchers will explore how leading Canadian companies are making progress on their pathway forward. BSV researchers are also leading ongoing work related to corporate greenwashing as well as transformational pathways towards net zero for Canadian industry.

  "answer_squad": " A Meta-Analysis of Brand Extension Success: The Effects of Parent Brand Equity and Extension Fit",
  "text": "Researchers from University of International Business and Economics, University of Groningen, University of Cologne, and University of Chinese Academy of Sciences published a new Journal of Marketing article that examines the drivers of brand extension success.          The study is titled \"A Meta-Analysis of Brand Extension Success: The Effects of Parent Brand Equity and Extension Fit\" and is authored by Chenming Peng, Tammo H.A. Bijmolt, Franziska V\u00f6lckner, and Hong Zhao.When a company uses one of its established brand names on a new product or category, it is introducing a brand extension. For example, Google began as a search engine and that continues to be its core focus, but it also has a variety of products such as Google Cloud and Google Play. Almost 70% of new products in the consumer-packaged goods market in the U.S. are brand extensions.Managers expect that introducing a new product under an existing brand name can reduce introduction costs, lower the risk of failure, and increase firm profit. However, only 30% of all brand extensions in the U.S. consumer packaged goods market survive the first two years, a success rate similar to new brands. Given this unexpectedly high failure rate of brand extensions, it is vital for marketers to understand what drives the success of brand extensions.This new study offers insights into the drivers of brand extension success. It explores how companies can devise more successful brand extension strategies in terms of contextual factors (parent brand, extension, communication, and consumer factors) and the research methods used.The study provides three key findings that will benefit chief marketing officers.There is a 60.6% probability of a more positive response to a brand extension if parent brand equity improves. Similarly, there is a 61.4% probability of a positive response to a brand extension if extension fit improves.Peng says \"Managers should leverage both parent brand equity and extension fit to enhance brand extension success. However, pay more attention to extension fit because it is slightly more influential than parent brand equity.\"      Managers should pay attention to the differential effects of various dimensions of parent brand equity and extension fit. For example, when introducing an extension product, creating and highlighting similarities in product features and images of the parent brand and the extension is beneficial.\"We find that parent brand equity can strengthen the positive impact of extension fit on brand extension success and vice versa. Therefore, managers should consider parent brand equity and extension fit simultaneously,\" explains Bijmolt. Parent brand equity has a positive (though small) effect on brand extension success even if the extension has a poor fit. Similarly, extension fit exerts a positive (though small) effect on brand extension success even if the extension has a low parent brand equity.\"If the parent brand does not have high equity, brand extensions can still be a viable strategy for launching new products as long as the extension fits well with the parent brand. Likewise, an extension that does not have a good fit can still be successful as long as the parent brand is strong,\" V\u00f6lckner adds.Managers should take a broader perspective on brand extension strategies by considering contextual factors related to the parent brand, the extension product, communication, and consumers. For example, managers of brands whose existing core products are services should particularly emphasize the equity of the parent brand (and its dimensions) when introducing an extension product.Besides the contextual factors, the research team also investigates the potential moderating effects of research method factors. Zhao says, \"For example, in our large database covering 26 countries, we do not find evidence of a moderating role of the region in which the data were collected, thereby contributing to the debate on whether Eastern cultures have a different way of evaluating brand extensions than Western cultures.\"In summary, this study develops empirical generalizations and findings about the main effects, relative importance, and interaction effect of the two key drivers of brand extension success\u2014parent brand equity and extension fit. It suggests how to devise more successful brand extension strategies in terms of five groups of moderators: contextual factors (parent brand, extension, communication, and consumer factors) and research method factors.

  "text": "The Royal Easter Show and the NSW Police recently announced a ban on \"rapper music\" following the murder of Pacific young person, Uati \"Pele\" Faletolu last year.          The Royal Easter Show's general manager Murray Wilton said, \"If you look at the psychology of music \u2026 there is scientific fact the type of music that is played actually predicts somebody's behavior\u2026 There will be no music played [at the show] that is rapper music, or has swearing words through it, or has any offensive language.\"This rather comic invention of a new genre \"rapper music\" was actually aimed at banning, we suspect, \"drill\" or \"drill rap.\" This is entirely in chorus with NSW Police Strike Force Raptor, which has spent a disproportionate amount of taxpayer money pursuing, disrupting and generally harassing drill musicians under the premise that their lyrics incite violence or help recruit gang members.As we point out in our recent paper, drill is a variant of hip-hop. It is musically innovative, lyrically inventive and globally popular. It is also particularly popular among young people in Western Sydney. Its lyrics do often deal with street life and sometimes violent crime, using a particular street vernacular.But drill is not alone in exploring violent themes. Country music, for example, also has a long tradition of dealing in murder. In popular music, Nick Cave cemented his international reputation with an album of murder ballads.In fact, there is virtually no evidence to support the claim that music causes crime. What research has shown is that policing music and musicians often criminalizes or marginalizes young people, particularly young people of color. It also pushes particular musical genres underground, away from legitimate venues. Moreover, for many artists seeking to emphasis their authentic street-cred, being pursued by police is not really so bad for business.Two days after the media reports of a ban, in something of an embarrassing backflip, the Royal Agricultural Society of NSW chief executive Brock Gilmour said organizers, not police, had decided to prohibit music containing swearwords:\"If there's rap music that's quite pleasant and there's no offensive language, they can play it, that's not an issue.\"      What is drill music?Drill is a subgenre of hip-hop that originated in Chicago in the early 2010s. It is characterized by its aggressive, trap-style beats and lyrics that often focus on themes of violence, crime and life on the streets. The music is often associated with gang culture and has been subject to controversy and criminalization due to its perceived links to real-life violence and criminal activity.Drill in Australia was largely pioneered by ONEFOUR, a group of five core members with Pacific Islander background from the Western Sydney suburb of Mt Druitt. They have gained international success and broad popularity, despite having encountered significant obstacles to performing in their own country.Police have systematically scrutinized their music and excluded them from performing at, among other venues, the Sydney Opera House for the Vivid Festival in 2021, claiming one of their songs could incite violence. The story of ONEFOUR has turned police into musicologists and musicians into criminals.Music as a crimeThe criminalization of rap and hip-hop is not new, as it has long been perceived as a threat to social order and public safety. Artists such as Cypress Hill, Snoop Dogg, and even Rage Against the Machine have faced surveillance, censorship and curtailment.N.W.A's song Fuck Tha Police was for a time banned on Australian national youth network triple j, and Akon and Eminem's performances have been banned due to violence and offensive lyrics. Jazz and punk genres played by marginalized people have also been policed.Today, hip-hop has become mainstream and respectable, yet criminal justice agencies have become more even proactive in policing and prosecuting particular artists, and there has been an increase in the use of lyrics as evidence in the United States and United Kingdom. The fact is, though, as hip-hop become more popular around the world, crime rates have meanwhile dropped, even in major cities like New York or Los Angeles, the home of gangsta rap. Does this mean hip-hop prevents crime? Well, no, but it does highlight the fallacy of drawing such causal links.MusicriminologyWe know music can touch us emotionally, make us cry, encourage us to dance, and even provide a soundtrack to social change. Scholars have long studied music's role in protest and resistance\u2014even its role in redemption in correctional settings.The confusion between rap music and the so-called street gangs has been studied, and the salacious pleasures and desires wrapped up in violent or crime storytelling have been analyzed by researchers. One of us (Murray) coined the term \"musicriminology\" to describe these fields of research and scholarship. We have further suggested that police targeting of drill artists constitutes a form of aesthetic policing\u2014the pursuit of rappers police don't like the sounds, symbols or looks of.While we can clearly point to the fact that policing practices and social reactions to music can criminalize and stigmatize artists, the link between music and offending behavior is far more complex. Counterintuitively, for example, researchers found listeners attracted to extreme music (such as certain types of death metal and rap) report positive psychosocial outcomes such as empowerment, joy and peacefulness.We are not suggesting all music is suitable for all occasions. Most parents would want to keep their young children from watching horror films, just as they might not want them to listen to drill music.Drill could be best described as a form of music that reflects the lives and street codes of marginalized groups of youth, and does it in a way that fictionalizes, embellishes and overemphasizes their \"gangsta\" credentials. It sometimes provides a platform for goading other groups through rhymes.However, it is unlikely to turn anyone to crime. That is not to say those involved in crime might not also like to listen to it\u2014just as they might like to hear Johnny Cash croon that he \"shot a man just to watch him die.\"In anything, blanket bans on musical styles are likely to work against the well-being of already marginalized groups, stoking social and cultural division, and providing the context for further criminalization.

  "answer_squad": " bromance",
  "text": "Male friendships are often presented in the media and popular culture as relatively superficial, competitive and lacking in emotional depth.          With this in mind, it's not entirely surprising that some people seem to think men have a problem with friendships. While women may be especially quick to draw this conclusion, the idea exists in society as a whole.Men, we are led to believe, either have low quality friendships, or not enough of them. They lean on women for intimacy, shying away from deep and real connections elsewhere.All of this supposedly increases their chances of loneliness, dysfunction and even suicide. But is this the whole story?Although we know some men do struggle with friendships\u2014indeed, some men have discussed having no male friends at all\u2014such representations tell a selective, and, we would argue, ultimately inaccurate story of the relationships men build and sustain.It's true that men often relate to others differently than women. For example, they might talk less about their emotions. But if we look closely at the way men express themselves and connect to other people, we can begin to see the beating heart of male friendships that's rarely acknowledged, and often dismissed.While women may be more skilled at emotional expressions, not all of their conversations are helpful. Some female-to-female friendships can lack empathy and understanding, or the support expected of friends during life's trials and tribulations.By focusing on the relative lack of verbal expression to suggest that male friendships are not close, we risk limiting our understanding of what intimacy is. We then do not see how men demonstrate closeness less obviously, in coded ways, or even silently.      Humor is one exampleContrary to the notion that it's used to \"put up walls,\" humor, such as the use of provocative nicknames, can promote a sense of closeness. Humor in the military, for instance, is used to express the hardships of the work and channel aggression, all the while creating a sense of togetherness.There's an irony in the fact that talk between men which might be construed as offensive to an outside observer, instead can signify an emotional closeness that could only be established between good friends. As one participant in a study of male insults said, \"Maybe down the track you might become close enough and then you might start ripping into each other [\u2026] I think if people hear you talking like that to other blokes, then they definitely know you're good mates.\"Resisting masculinityAmid unspoken rules that men should be \"macho\" and not express weakness, it's no wonder they sometimes struggle to open up emotionally.But readings of male friendships as shallow assume that men are unable to negotiate the rules of masculinity. The truth is that regimes of masculinity are largely imposed on men, and they do their best to play the game, or subvert masculinity if they can.Many men resist competitive masculinity enough to express vulnerabilities and create deep connections. Still, some men (especially \"traditional\" men) bury emotions so deeply that it can be hard for them to know what they feel, or even how to name their emotions. Feelings can become foreign, frightening territory, with the temptation to use alcohol and drugs to deal with them.For some men, opening up and expressing vulnerability is not an option, or perhaps only becomes possible in certain contexts. Drinking is one such context. \"Lads will only talk when there's beer on board, you know, when the guard is down,\" as one participant noted in a different study of communication in male friendship.The risks of opening up include rejection and shaming. But emotional intimacy is possible even in the most unlikely situations, such as stag parties, where emotional expressions of male-to-male love are common (for example, during speeches), and are not scorned.The rise of the bromanceDespite simplistic depictions of men, male friendships are diverse and evolving. Hysteria around homosexuality has undergone a long decline over the decades, and the threat of the gay label no longer instills such panic in young men who dare to express sensitivity and seek intimacy with other men, sexual or non-sexual.No phenomenon illustrates this better than the rise of the \"bromance.\" The term may have emerged from skateboarding in the 1990s, when heterosexual men commonly shared hotel rooms while on tour. The idea of this strong male-to-male bond has even been given a nod in popular culture, with films like I Love You, Man.Bromances can offer a high level of intimacy and support. Young men talk about how their bromances are on another level to friendships in terms of trust, expression of vulnerability and physical affection.One participant in a study of bromances noted: \"I hug him and kiss him and tell him I love him.\" Another said a bromance involves \"someone you can share secrets and pain with, and love, but there is no sort of sexual attraction.\" A third stated: \"It doesn't matter what you tell him, he is always there to listen.\"'Leveling up' male friendshipsResearch shows younger men are engaging in close male friendships and expressing their feelings like never before. They are adept at negotiating the rules of masculinity. They will open up to others in safe contexts\u2014although not all men have these safe spaces.We believe creating more of these safe zones for young men is key. For example, it seems that by encouraging men to do activities side by side, or that have a \"purpose\" (such as volunteering or attending men's sheds to create things), male bonding and important conversations naturally emerge.Although there are concerns that some online activities and forums can be dangerous (for example, potentially increasing the risk of recruitment into online misogyny groups), anonymous online discussion forums can help men connect and express themselves about the things that matter without fear of judgment.And with the caveat that alcohol has obvious problems, if men are going to drink then doing so with friends may not be the worst way of encouraging emotional connections.

The iconic Blue Flag is an international mark of recognition that a beach, marina or sustainable tourism boat is deemed safe and environmentally friendly.The research findings show that tourist destination managers should use the Blue Flag logo in marketing and branding material to increase revenue.The study also found that the popular eco-label is attractive to tourists who can use it to reinforce their own identity.Professor of Marketing, Yuksel Ekinci, from the University's Faculty of Business and Law, said, \"Tourists willing to pay more to visit a location with the Blue Flag stamp of approval are looking for a destination that aligns with their own sustainability values. They hope that their choice of holiday promotes their own self-identity and that they'll meet like minded people.\"\"This research can assist in informing tourism management strategies for coastal destinations looking to attract environmentally conscious tourists.\"The study, which is the first of its kind to provide empirical evidence of its positive impact on coastal destinations, was conducted through two online experiments.The first experiment surveyed 152 participants to see the effect of Blue Flag promotion on price using a resort in Marmaris, Turkey. The second involved 160 participants using a resort in Malaga, Spain.Professor Ekinci added, \"The results suggest that deploying the Blue Flag logo can significantly enhance a destination's brand identification, perceived destination quality and the tourist's willingness to pay a price premium.\"\"It's clearly an important marketing tool to influence a tourist's decision making.\"The Blue Flag is awarded by the Denmark-based Foundation for Environmental Education for beaches, marinas, and tourist boats.

  "answer_squad": " Tania Reynolds",
  "text": "When considering laws, workplace policies or school rules, one might take notice of whom they impact. New research from the University of New Mexico has found whether it's interventions to reduce workplace bullying, help with weight loss, or enhance student engagement, people show a gender bias in how they feel.          UNM Psychology Assistant Professor Tania Reynolds has published new research that shows people prefer interventions when they inflict damage onto men instead of women. The paper is published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior.She and her international colleagues Maja Graso and Karl Aquino discovered this through three different studies, each using a variety of scenarios.Previous work by Reynolds has found that people show a bias in their tendency to label individuals as victims or perpetrators, known as moral typecasting. Her work found that people more readily stereotyped women as victims and men as perpetrators.\"People's assumptions of who's a victim and who's a perpetrator differs by gender. People tend to stereotype men as perpetrators and women as victims. This project built upon those findings by examining how people evaluate harm, when that harm is unintended and results from interventions aimed at helping people,\" Reynolds said.Many times, there are interventions which are equal and don't adversely affect one population over another. Still, there are plenty of instances in which policies or interventions carry negative externalities, known as collateral harm.\"Most policies have trade-offs whereby some individuals are benefitted, and some are either not affected or actively harmed,\" Reynolds said. \"How do people evaluate these costs? If it's the case that one gender benefits while the other is harmed, might that influence whether people evaluate the intervention or policy as worthwhile?\"Graso and Reynolds presented participants with scenarios describing various interventions, such as programs to reduce workplace harassment, medical treatment for chronic pain, and interventions to increase students' feelings of belonging in the classroom.For each program participants evaluated, they were told that the intervention benefitted one gender, but harmed the other. However, participants were randomly assigned to a gender condition, so sometimes men were helped and women harmed, or vice versa.      \"Maybe there is some program that gets implemented statewide or across an educational system, or within organizations where one sex doesn't like it or experiences collateral harm,\" Reynolds said.People preferred when men were harmed and women benefited, but across both of those studies, it was pretty much female participants that showed the gender bias, not male participants. Women don't want other women being harmed, whereas men seem to be even more evenhanded, where they were equally likely to endorse the treatments or interventions, whether they harmed men or women.\"In this context, people were more supportive of the intervention if men found it offensive than if women found it offensive,\" Reynolds said. \"They more strongly supported interventions if men suffered health impairments, decrements in learning, increase in chronic pain, or decreased motivation to gain employment, compared to when women suffered those same exact costs.\"More often than not, women and those who identified as feminists, gave a thumbs up when policies negatively affected men, while preferring those that benefited women.That was the case across each scenario.\"What we found is that beyond just participants' sex, people who more strongly endorsed egalitarianism or feminism showed these gender biases to larger degrees,\" Reynolds said.There are theories as to why these decisions were made. Although there are no sure-fire explanations, Reynolds thinks there is a historical element.\"Both of those ideologies have to do with rectifying historical injustices, so maybe it's part of the reason why people endorse harm to men,\" she said. \"Throughout history, women have typically had to sacrifice in contexts like caring for the elderly or infants. Likewise women have not had the same career or educational opportunities. Perhaps people who identify as feminists or egalitarians perceive men to have benefited throughout history, and therefore they now evaluate it as fair if men suffer and women gain an advantage.\"She also thinks some credit could go to evolutionary psychology. Throughout human history, many societies practiced patrilocality, where women resided with their husbands' families instead of their own.\"Women were with their husbands' families, and they were trying to figure out who they could trust in this group when they might not have known anyone. Women needed to find ways of recruiting female allies and figuring out who to trust,\" Reynolds said. \"Perhaps the women that demonstrated their allegiance to and care for other women were more often chosen as allies. That is, perhaps having a pro-women bias allowed women to better recruit social support.\"Reynolds believes there are major societal implications in these patterns of findings. For example, female policy makers might advance policies that minimize harm to women, but maybe not to men.\"Is intervention or policy worthwhile? We have a hard time putting our personal preferences to the side and who knows, maybe we shouldn't. It's just worth noting that there is this bias, so that way we can be fully informed about the policies that we adopt or interventions that we implement. We might not be as even handed as we think we are,\" she said.She recommends applying the veil of ignorance when deciding how to intervene fairly.\"What is considered fair is if you were to trade places with someone else, would you want the same outcome? I think that that might be a good way of deciding whether something is fair. You could blind people to who was harmed and ask them if that harm is acceptable,\" Reynolds said.Either way, there is much more to explore when it comes to understanding the sources of these biases.\"I would be interested in intertwining my two lines of research on harm evaluation and the challenges faced by our female ancestors across human history,\" Reynolds said. \"Perhaps one way that you could test whether women tend to prefer other women who have pro-female biases is by presenting female participants with a hypothetical who either generally takes the side of women or shows no gender preference. I'd be curious which woman do women prefer as their friend.\"Although this innovative research took time and patience, Reynolds believes it's well worth it.\"We had a hard time getting this paper published. It goes to show you have to be resilient and believe in your work,\" Reynolds said. \"It's a nice feeling and makes the research worth it\u2013a good reminder persistence pays off.\" More information:Maja Graso et al, Worth the Risk?

  "text": "An archaeological research project spanning five years has shed new light on a tragic chapter in Australian history, revealing a wealth of evidence that has helped to unravel the haunting tale of the Batavia maritime disaster and subsequent mutiny.          Findings from the international research team, led by archaeologists from The University of Western Australia and the Western Australian Museum and published in Historical Archaeology, include the unearthing of single and multiple graves, as well as evidence of survivors' resistance to mutineers.The Dutch East India Company's ill-fated ship Batavia, lost in 1629 off WA's Abrolhos Islands, has captivated historians and adventurers for centuries.Lead author Professor Alistair Paterson, from UWA's School of Social Sciences and the Oceans Institute, said artifacts and gravesites tell a tale of survival, resistance and grim consequences faced by those involved.\"Through meticulous analysis, we've discovered the remains of 12 victims, interred in both individual and mass graves, as well as evidence of a fierce struggle between survivors and a group of mutineers, and remnants of a possible gallows site where justice was served,\" Professor Paterson said.He said the finds provide invaluable insight into the survival landscape encountered by some of the earliest Europeans to visit Australia and have expanded focus beyond the Batavia wreck itself.\"In addition to underwater findings, what we've uncovered on land has contributed to our understanding of the behavioral responses of survivors, including their initial movement from the wreck to nearby islands, the struggles they faced, and the shifting power dynamics among mutineers and survivors,\" he said.\"The excavation of human remains reveals insights into the treatment and burial practices of victims. Notably, centrally located graves on Beacon Island suggest a functioning graveyard, potentially representing victims from the early days following the wreck.\"Other islands within the vicinity, such as Long (Seals) Island and West Wallabi Island, provide evidence of makeshift weapons, the presence of resistance factions, and structures associated with the survivors.\"The landscape on Long Island contains a concentration of iron fastenings believed to be the gallows site where mutineers were executed, reflecting the company's attempt to establish order.\"Future research in a new ARC Project \"Mobilizing Dutch East India Company collections for new global stories\" involves further forensic analysis of human remains, including physical assessment, stable-isotope technology and DNA studies and new historical research.

  "text": "Imagine you could travel to only 1% of the city where you live\u2014areas that were easily accessible to other residents.          That's the situation for manual wheelchair users traveling by public buses in Columbus, a first-of-its-kind study finds. The situation for those with powered wheelchairs is only somewhat better\u2014the study found they have access to about 25% of the areas available to the general bus ridership.But the main problem isn't with the bus system itself\u2014the key obstacle is with the sidewalks and other infrastructure that wheelchair users need to get from their homes to bus stops and from bus stops to their final destinations, researchers found.\"Damaged and missing sidewalks are a huge factor in making much of the city inaccessible to wheelchair users who rely on public transportation to get around,\" said Luyu Liu, lead author of the study and a doctoral student in geography at The Ohio State University.\"People with mobility disabilities need to get to and from bus stops in order to use public transportation and that isn't easy in many parts of the city.\"The study, published recently in the Journal of Transport Geography, is significant because it is one of the first studies to obtain high-resolution, real-time data on the usage of buses by people with and without disabilities and compare it with data on infrastructure such as sidewalks.\"We've never been able to do an analysis like this before. The data simply did not exist until recently,\" said study co-author Harvey Miller, professor of geography at Ohio State and director of the university's Center for Urban and Regional Analysis.\"It allows us to get new insights into how public transportation operates in our cities and the social equity challenges we are facing.\"And while this study was done in Columbus, it is not the only city that has an accessibility problem for those with disabilities.      \"Columbus is typical of many cities in the United States, particularly cities of a similar size, because they are very car dependent,\" Miller said.\"Public transit is not emphasized in many American cities, and many cities have a problem with providing sidewalks.\"The study area is Franklin County, where Columbus is located. Franklin County is home to 1.3 million people, including about 64,000 who have mobility disabilities. The researchers focus on the Central Ohio Transit Authority bus system, which serves about 50,000 people daily.The researchers had access to real-time data on bus operations between 2018 and 2021, including the number of riders and every time a bus deployed equipment to accommodate a wheelchair.In addition, they used data on all recorded sidewalks in the Franklin County area and the status of each sidewalk segment.Results showed \"striking disparities in accessibility\" in the bus system between people with mobility disabilities and non-disabled users, Liu said.In one analysis, the researchers found how many of the bus stops could get users to various spots in the city within 30 minutes. They found that 75% fewer bus stops could get people with manual wheelchairs to specified points within 30 minutes compared to non-disabled users. Powered wheelchair users had 59% fewer stops.The researchers then completed calculations that gave riders twice as much time\u201460 minutes\u2014to get to various spots, and disabled riders were still at a huge disadvantage.\"Even if we could wave a magic wand and give disabled riders an unrealistic amount of time to travel, they would still have access to significantly fewer opportunities and resources than the general population,\" Miller said.In the bus rider usage data, the study found that the bus stops that people with disabilities tended to use were very different\u2014and a much smaller number\u2014than those of the general population.\"Wheelchair users are self-segregated into areas of the city where they know there are sidewalks and built infrastructure that they can use to get to bus stops,\" Liu said.Spatial patterns identified in the study showed that in much of the city, people with mobility disabilities had accessibility levels that were 60% to 100% below levels for public transit users without disabilities.Strikingly, they found that they core of the city\u2014the place with the highest overall ridership and accessibility\u2014was also the place with the highest access disparities between those with disabilities and those without.That's because the center of the city has the highest level of accessibility to all parts of the city to those without disabilities. But for those with disabilities, there were many places they could theoretically travel to from the center of the city\u2014but once they reached the bus stop, they had no good way of getting to their final destination.\"Once you get there, there are no sidewalks,\" Liu said. \"You're stuck.\"Miller said the study shows that buses and bus stops that are accessible to people with disabilities are necessary, but not sufficient, for those who use wheelchairs.\"Sidewalks are part of our transportation system. We cannot have effective and equitable public transit without having a good sidewalk network,\" he said.Miller noted that those with mobility disabilities are more likely than others to be less affluent and to have to rely on public transit to get to jobs, medical appointments and shopping. That makes it even more crucial to ensure that infrastructure works for them throughout the city.\"Public transit is not a business, it is not just a social service. It is crucial urban infrastructure,\" Miller said. \"Sidewalks are part of that.\"Other co-authors, all at Ohio State, were Armita Kar, Ahmad Ilderim Tokey and Huyen T.K. Le.

The problem is both sides increasingly tend to disparage the value of what the other side champions, the authors said.\"Both tasks are absolutely essential for society,\" said Bushman, a professor of communication at The Ohio State University.\"But the two tasks have become increasingly at odds in American society, leading to mutual hostility and disrespect between liberals and conservatives.\"And the best solution won't be easily accepted by either side, said Baumeister, who is a professor of psychology at the University of Queensland.\"We have the unpopular view that a modern society will be best served if political parties share or alternate power,\" Baumeister said.\"The sooner we recognize this, the better off we will be.\"The new theory is based on Baumeister's 2005 book \"The Cultural Animal: Human Nature, Meaning, and Social Life.\" Baumeister wrote that human evolution favored traits that allowed people to benefit from cultural society\u2014and these advances enabled societies to amass more resources, such as by group hunting, sharing information and developing tools.But those resources also need to be shared widely for society as a whole to prosper.The divide between the political right and left on amassing versus distributing resources can be seen in which voters support which parties.The Republican Party\u2014the party of the right\u2014draws support from farmers, ranchers, business people and others who produce resources.On the other hand, the left-leaning Democratic Party is dominated by those most interested in redistributing resources, such as individuals in the labor movement.      \"Both sides of the political divide emphasize practices that have been important in the success of humans as a species,\" Bushman said. \"We wouldn't be where we are today if we hadn't found ways to both amass resources and distribute them widely.\"The authors emphasize that their theory doesn't explain all the complexities and processes of partisan conflict. Some topics that drive political conflicts, such as the death penalty, abortion rights and same-sex marriage, are not directly linked to resources.\"We propose merely that our formulation is correct far more often than not\u2014and that it offers considerable explanatory power,\" the authors write.The conflict between amassing and distributing resources is not new\u2014so why has partisan hostility grown so much lately?Baumeister said the reason may be that nearly all modern economies succeed through the use of incentives. People are rewarded for finding ways to amass more resources\u2014but incentives inevitably create inequality.\"Incentives help create more resources, which the right supports. But the left is concerned because it creates inequality,\" Baumeister said.And over time, the people who amass those resources pass them on to their children.\"Each generation passes some of its advantages to their children, and over multiple generations some children are privileged by even wider margins,\" Baumeister said.That's where we are at in the United States now, the authors said, with a growing portion of resources being concentrated among a select few.\"Privilege is a difficult problem, with successful parents passing their resources onto children who themselves have not earned it,\" Baumeister said.The best solution may be to have the political parties of the right and left alternate or share power. The fact that long-term one-party rule has led to failure and underachievement in countries such as Zaire, Cuba, North Korea, the Soviet Union, Venezuela and others is a warning, according to the authors.\"If one party has the right answers, it should eventually win all the elections, to the widespread satisfaction of pretty much everyone,\" the authors wrote. \"But this seems not to happen in successful democracies.\"What this means is that there has to be an end to political hostility and more healthy respect for the importance of both amassing and distributing resources, Baumeister and Bushman said.\"It doesn't do any good for society to have political opponents who see each other as mortal enemies who don't have anything good to contribute,\" Baumeister said.That suggests citizens and media can help by \"recognizing and rewarding politicians who do cooperate with opponents and see the value in what they do,\" Bushman said.\"We need more mutual respect and less hating and demonizing of the opposite side.\" More information:Roy F.

  "text": "Attitudes about gun violence and firearm policies are influenced by race more than age, and opinions vary widely based on whether respondents were born in the U.S. and their political affiliation, according to a recent University of Maryland Critical Issues Poll conducted with Ipsos.          Among the key findings of the poll, directed by Department of Government and Politics Professors Shibley Telhami and Stella Rouse, those born outside the U.S. were more likely to support greater gun restrictions compared to those born in the U.S. Of those foreign-born respondents, only 14% believed that tighter school security was most likely to reduce gun violence against children, while 33% said fewer guns would do so, and 42% said both equally.In comparison, a third of those born in the U.S. said that gun violence against children would be reduced by tighter security, 19% said by fewer guns and 28% by both equally.While 64% of foreign-born respondents said stricter gun control would lead to fewer mass shootings, 49% of U.S.-born respondents said the same. Meanwhile, 44% of those born in the U.S. said tighter restrictions would have no effect; just 27% of those born elsewhere agreed.\"It's well established that the U.S. leads developed countries by a wide margin in both the number of guns and the number of gun homicides, two correlated measures,\" said Telhami, the Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development. \"This may be one reason why U.S.-born and foreign-born Americans express different attitudes on guns and gun violence.\"The poll of 1,203 adults nationwide was conducted March 27\u2013April 5 and had a margin of error of 3.2%.As in previous Critical Issues Polls, Black Americans were more likely to consider gun policy \"very important\" compared to other races and ethnicities. In the latest results, they were more likely to say that if more Americans owned guns, there would be more crime (41%) or that it would make no difference (46%) than white Americans (28% and 40%, respectively). Hispanic Americans were in the middle (38% and 29%, respectively).In comparison, Americans of different age groups varied less in their views. Thirty-seven percent of those under 30 years old said that if Americans owned more guns there would be more crime, and 38% said it would make no difference, compared to 33% and 39%, respectively, of Americans 30 years of age and older.Americans with higher education were more likely to say that more guns would lead to more crime: 27% of high school graduates and some college said more guns would lead to more crime, compared to 40% of those with a bachelor's degree and 48% of those with a master's degree or higher.The survey also found that the partisan gap on attitudes about the impact of guns on crime has widened since 2021. When asked whether stricter requirements to legally obtain a gun would cause fewer mass shooting or more, only 34% of Republicans said it would reduce the number compared to 80% of Democrats. Most Republicans (58%) said it would make no difference in the number of mass shootings, compared to only 16% of Democrats. In addition, whereas 55% of Republicans said that tighter school security was more likely to reduce gun violence against children, only 8% of Democrats felt the same, with 43% saying fewer guns in the community would be more effective.Regarding the impact of access to guns on crime rates, most Democrats said that more guns would increase U.S. crime, while 49% of Republicans said it would cause less crime. At the same time, only a quarter of Democrats said more guns would have no impact on crime rates compared to 42% of Republicans who said the same.Notably, the percentage of Republicans who say that more guns would decrease crime has declined in recent years. A Pew Research Center Poll in 2021, fielding the same question as the UMD poll, found that 56% of Republicans said that more guns would lead to less crime. The latest UMD poll showed that percentage dropping to 49%. In comparison, the percentage of Democrats saying that more guns would lead to more crime has grown from 55% in 2021 to 68% in 2023.An in-depth analysis of the poll results will be part of a full report released later this month.

  "text": "Just four years ago, the Spanish Supreme Court pointed out in a ruling that there is no such thing as a \"conjugal debt.\" In other words, a woman is not obliged to satisfy her husband's sexual needs. It may come as a surprise that this point still needs to be made, but the statistics speak for themselves. According to a national survey carried out in 2019, 7.5% of Spanish women over 16 years old have been raped by their partners or ex-partners.          These rapes are usually subject to less attention, and they tend to be \"perceived as something less serious.\" So says Josep Maria Tamarit Sumalla, a full professor of Criminal Law at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) and the lead author of a pioneering study in Spain which concludes that Spanish courts hand down milder punishments for rapes when they are committed by the victim's partner or ex-partner.The study is titled \"How Criminal Is It to Rape a Partner According to the Justice System? Analysis of Sentences in Spain (2015-2022),\" and has been published in the European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research. It examines nearly a thousand rulings on cases of rape in which the victims were adult women, which were handed down by Spain's provincial courts between 2015 and 2022.The conclusions are clear: when the rapist is the victim's partner or ex-partner, \"there are fewer convictions, the punishments are milder, and the compensation amounts are lower,\" according to the professor, who is also a researcher in the VICRIM (Empirical and applied victimology) group in the Faculty of Law and Political Science at the UOC.Fewer convictions and one year less in prisonWhen conducting the study, the team of researchers selected all rape cases in which adult women were the victims, heard in Spain's provincial courts between 2015 and 2022. Among other factors, they looked at whether the cases had led to a conviction, the prison sentence and the amount of financial compensation that had been imposed.In 37% of the 964 rape cases studied, the offender was the victim's partner or ex-partner; it was someone known to the victim in 17.6% of cases; it was a stranger in 22.7% of cases, and the offender was a relative of the victim in 20.9% of cases.The study shows that the judges decided to convict 62% of those accused of rape who were partners or ex-partners of the victims. This percentage increases by 17 points, up to an average of 79%, in other cases. \"That's a statistically significant difference,\" Tamarit pointed out.The average prison term for those convicted was 83.4 months in cases of intimate partner rape, and 95.1 months in the other cases. In other words, the average length of the prison sentence was one year less for partners and ex-partners.Partners and ex-partners had to pay an average compensation amount of around \u20ac12,600. Meanwhile, the compensation was almost \u20ac17,800 in the other cases.      An aggravating factor in only 22% of casesThe Spanish Criminal Code made no explicit reference to a rape or sexual assault being committed within an intimate partner relationship until 2022. As a result, the judges had to issue sentences on both types of cases on the same basis, although they were able to take intimate partner relationships into account as a mitigating or aggravating factor due to the relationship between the offender and the victim.\"Our analysis has concluded that the courts only found this situation to be an aggravating factor in 22% of cases. Most rulings did not mention it at all, and milder sentences were imposed as a result,\" said Tamarit.This situation will change as a result of the country's 'only yes is yes' law, which was passed in October 2022. \"Since the reform of the law, the courts must now increase the penalty when the rape takes place within an intimate partner relationship, and there will probably be a change,\" the professor continued.On the other hand, the professor of Criminal Law at the UOC said that the judges' task is not an easy one because in cases involving rape within intimate partner relationships, there is often a lack of evidence and, furthermore, \"the law exempts the victim from the obligation to testify.\"Limited study of psychological effectsThe article by the UOC researchers also points out that the prison sentences are longer and the financial compensation amounts are higher when the judges consider that the rape has had a serious psychological impact on the victims.\"It wasn't taken into account in many sentences because it wasn't apparent. The court isn't always able to take it into consideration, because there isn't always an expert assessment. There's still a long way to go to ensure that all victims receive a psychological assessment,\" Tamarit pointed out.The perspective and gender of judgesAs regards the judges' conscious or unconscious beliefs, the UOC professor refers to the myth of the 'real rape': \"According to the stereotype, a real rape is committed against an attractive young girl by someone she doesn't know. Anything that differs from that profile may have greater difficulty being recognized as such, whether it's the rape of a man, of an elderly woman or a rape within an intimate partner relationship.\"When assessing the extent to which judges are affected by this myth, \"we'd need more qualitative studies and interviews with them, which is very difficult,\" he added.Nevertheless, with regard to the study they have already published, \"The fact that there is this difference in penalties must be considered within the framework of a Spanish Criminal Code which imposes very severe penalties in cases of rape compared to other countries. We wouldn't like to say whether it should be subject to longer terms of imprisonment. But we have found that there is some degree of inertia in terms of failing to take cases of sexual violence within an intimate partner relationship as seriously. And they do need to be taken seriously,\" concluded Tamarit. More information:J.M. Tamarit Sumalla et al, How Criminal Is It to Rape a Partner According to the Justice System?

  "text": "People from underrepresented ethnic and racial groups tend to rate poor customer service less negatively than white people do, according to new peer-reviewed research we co-authored.          Many companies in the service sector, such as banks and airlines, use customer satisfaction surveys so they can figure out how to improve their operations. There's an implicit assumption that the feedback given will accurately reflect the actual quality of the service provided.Companies may also assume that customers, regardless of their socioeconomic background, will give similar evaluations for good service\u2014and that people will recognize poor or discriminatory service when they experience it.Our research team wanted to see if that's really the case.In our first study, we recruited nine male small-business owners in Los Angeles to act as \"mystery shoppers\" to help us compare the treatment of different racial groups. They had similar ages, heights, builds and education; three were Black, three were Hispanic and three were white.We then sent the men, who wore identical shirts and pants, to a total of 69 banks to ask for a loan based on identical customer profiles. They also secretly recorded the meetings using a camera embedded in their shirt\u2014a method approved by the state's attorney general's office. After each meeting ended, participants filled out a questionnaire describing the experience, including their level of satisfaction.Overall, we found that participants, regardless of race or ethnicity, reported similar levels of satisfaction during the bank encounters. Since past research has found that Black and Hispanic customers experience objectively worse treatment, we wanted to dig deeper to understand why satisfaction levels were similar.We analyzed 26 of the videos to see if there were objective disparities in how our mystery shoppers were treated. We found that Black and Hispanic participants were given significantly less time than white participants, waited longer to see a bank employee, and experienced other subtle forms of discrimination.We wanted to see how pervasive these differing perceptions of good and bad customer service were for people from underrepresented groups. In two additional studies, we recruited over 300 people from a variety of backgrounds to watch clips from these videos that show positive and negative interactions and evaluate the encounters. We found that while all groups rated positive scenarios similarly, Black and Hispanic viewers tended to perceive negative experiences in a better light than white viewers.Research has shown that discrimination in customer-worker interactions in the service sector is often difficult to detect and fix. This is particularly challenging when the biases are subtle and less obvious in slights often referred to as microaggressions.Unfortunately, customers from underrepresented ethnic or racial groups may become indifferent, desensitized or even accepting of repeated discriminatory service over time. In one-on-one exchanges in places like bank branches, customers may be less aware of discriminatory service because they are unable to directly compare the service they receive with that of other customers. So relying on customer feedback to detect service failures may be a poor way to fix discriminatory behavior.Research has shown that discrimination in financial services has far-reaching implications for underrepresented consumers. These include the inability to get a loan or mortgage, accumulate savings and build wealth. Financial service institutions' reputation for discrimination also makes it difficult for these companies to attract employees and customers.To avoid these problems, we believe managers should find more objective ways to evaluate the discriminatory treatment of underrepresented customers and find ways to improve.We believe more research is needed on the underlying assumptions managers make in tracking, evaluating and eliminating discriminatory behavior\u2014which, in our view, is the ultimate service failure.

  "text": "Almost three billion hectares of farmland is in poor condition worldwide\u2014an area the size of Russia. Biodiversity is in freefall. Extinctions are rising. Wild animal populations have fallen almost 70% since 1970.          Restoring damaged land and bringing back ecosystems is phenomenally expensive, estimated at A$21 trillion globally.The sheer scale of the problem is beyond the capacity of traditional approaches to funding repair. That's one reason why the Australian government is looking to alternatives such as a nature repair market. This, the government hopes, would boost biodiversity\u2014especially on private land such as farms.To make this market work, the government might consider creating a new version of Australia's well-known HECS higher education loans. Call it FECS\u2014Farm Environment Contribution Scheme.The lead author of this article, Bruce Chapman, helped create HECS\u2014the world's first national income-contingent loan for higher education. Co-author David Lindemayer, ecologist and conservation biologist, has spent decades exploring ways to preserve biodiversity on farmland.We have shown how farmers could access loans similar to HECS but based on annual revenue, not income to undertake work helping both their business and restoration of nature. This work will boost farm productivity and biodiversity with farmers repaying the loan when their revenues permit.Why is this needed?Australia has large swathes of degraded land and at least 100 species have gone extinct since European colonization. To prevent further extinctions, the government announced it would introduce a new nature repair market.This market could, if done well, tackle some of the drivers of biodiversity loss and land degradation\u2014particularly on our farmland. Protecting habitat and waterways, preventing erosion and improving drought resilience would all be eligible.Take farm dams. The vast majority of the 650,000 dams in the Murray-Darling Basin are in poor condition. To renovate one by fencing and re-vegetating around it costs about $9000.But farmers can make this money back. Livestock with access to better quality drinking water gains weight more quickly, giving farmers more cow to sell. There's a climate benefit too, as renovated dams change rapidly from carbon sources to carbon sinks. Plus, healthier dams provide habitat for more birds, frogs and dragonflies.The question is\u2014how do you fund this market? Creating tradeable certificates is one way but could be complicated. Another option is to create a rolling fund, where biodiversity loans are given to farmers to do nature repair work such as dam upgrades which help their bottom line\u2014and wildlife.      How would this work with the nature repair scheme?The federal government has pitched its planned nature repair market as an offset scheme: farmers and landholders do repair work and get biodiversity certificates which can be bought by, say, another farmer wanting to clear land.                Tackling erosion is expensive, but could bring benefits to farmers and nature. Credit: Shutterstock             But there's a complementary, parallel approach. All farms experience large swings in annual revenues from forces outside a farmer's control, such as rain, drought, floods and commodity price shocks. The best financial tool to help farmers undertake nature repair is the type which smooths their income. That's where revenue-dependent loans could work.Farmers would get the money needed for work on restoration and biodiversity recovery, and incur a debt to be repaid only when future revenue makes it possible. During bad years when farm income is low, repayments would be low or zero. During good years, more debt would be repaid to the government.This isn't wholly new. We already have policies allowing farmers to draw on savings from good years to help cope with poor years, coupled with associated tax benefits. By and large, this works well.Loans like HECS have this vital income-smoothing feature\u2014you only pay it back when you are in a position to do so. This scheme has worked well to share the cost of university education between the recipient, who will benefit directly from it, and society more broadly, which benefits from highly educated doctors, lawyers, business owners and so on.With this type of loan, you don't risk losing your farm if you can't repay the debt. They're better than extending your bank loan, because they don't add to repayments until you're in a position to make them.If these loans were added to our nature market, it could get much more traction than a grant scheme. This is because most of the money outlaid by government would be returned as the loans are repaid. It creates a revolving fund, allowing the government to finance many more projects with many more farms than with a grant which, when spent, is gone.What about the transparency problem?Government schemes can attract people trying to game the system for their own financial benefit.To avoid this, projects tied to a FECS loan would have ensure plantings, shelterbelts and dam renovations are effective and meet standards.We could borrow from decades of monitoring hundreds of sustainable farms in endangered temperate woodlands to create robust standards.These will be crucial to avoid perverse effects, such as the risk of promoting populations of the wrong species. Replanting along narrow strips can simply create habitat for damaging hyper-aggressive native birds like the noisy miner while introduced trees can harbor pests such as starlings. Robust monitoring will be needed to ensure restoration projects actually do produce more biodiversity.We'll need three types of monitoring:Compliance monitoring\u2014did a landowner do what they said they would?Inputs monitoring\u2014how much of the loan or grant was actually invested in fencing, planting trees or improving dams?Outcomes monitoring\u2014what was the end result? Did we get more species of native animals and invertebrates (including species of conservation concern)? As we wrestle with the best way forward for Australia's first nature repair market, we should seriously consider rolling out revenue-dependent loans for farmers.It could make life easier for farmers at little cost to the government\u2014and get the ball rolling on the ever more urgent issue of restoring land and the species that rely on it.

  "text": "Transportation within and between Canadian communities is frustrating at best. At worst it's impossible.          BBC's \"Race Across the World\" shows contestants trying to make their way around British Columbia without access to rental cars or planes. Limited transit options leave contestants frustrated, reliant on hitch-hiking and costly taxis.The show loses its entertainment value when viewers have to watch contestants struggle every day to find transportation\u2014especially rural viewers for whom this daily challenge is all too routine.Even so, compared with the rest of the country, rural B.C. actually has a large number of local transit options, as well as some longer distance inter-community services.BC Transit works with local governments and First Nations to deliver transit services. That's unique in Canada and partly accounts for the relatively large number of rural public transit systems in B.C.Transportation in rural Canada is an important issue. It's also poorly understood, leading to ongoing policy failures and solutions that miss the mark.Rural transit needsNot all people living in rural areas have personal vehicles. It's also a mistake to assume that regular, shorter trips happen within a single community. Inter-community travel is both long haul (occasional) and short (daily).Personal mobility is critically important to accessing basic services like education and health care, as well as for employment, shopping and recreation.Transit can increase available markets and workforce, make communities more attractive to potential residents and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In short, the benefits of accessible, affordable public transit in rural communities are economic, social and environmental.Despite these benefits, rural communities across Canada struggle to establish and maintain transit systems. They face barriers different from urban areas, as well as different from each other. In a recent study, my fellow researchers and I identified seven types of rural transit barriers.All rural transit systems are likely to face barriers related to cost. This is due in part to their small size, as systems lack the ridership and economies of scale of urban systems. This means they're less likely to be profitable because the benefits of transit are widespread across communities and society, while the costs are borne by the operator.Combinations of local factors, like the physical environment, travel patterns and economic structure, also create unique challenges not easily addressed with a traditional, fixed-route bus transit system.Rural communities need a high level of both human and financial capacity to start and maintain a transit system. Low (if any) potential profit means rural transit is often run by local governments or not-for-profit organizations, which require a high level of both human and financial capacity to start and maintain a transit system.Limited human and financial capacity in rural places has an impact on the ability to pay both hard costs and operational ones. Nonetheless, the operational costs and their ongoing strain on capacity pose the most significant challenge.      Gaps in our knowledgeThere is another issue: gaps within our knowledge base. In a synthesis of rural transit literature in Canada, my fellow researchers and I found three substantial gaps:Research on rural transit is limited.\"Rural\" is often treated as a single thing, as if all rural communities have the same needs and challenges, contradicting what we know about place-specific barriers.What we know is biased towards larger, urban-adjacent rural communities, as well as towards regions like Ontario and British Columbia.Overall, our understanding is narrow and incomplete. So it's no wonder that we see gaps in the policies and programs created based on this limited understanding.Government initiatives fall shortIn early 2023, the federal government announced Canada's Rural Transit Solutions Fund would be accepting applications for capital projects.With $250 million over five years dedicated to rural communities, the fund eliminates competition with urban centers. It is flexible in terms of what can be funded by government, and it's open to innovative ideas. It's also open to partnerships offering inter-community transit.The gap is in what it won't fund. There are no funds related to operations. You can buy a bus or other vehicles, but you cannot lease one for a short-term pilot project. You can't pay for a driver, or any of the other people needed to design, manage or operate a system.It is typical of government funding not to cover operational costs. However, given the severity of the rural capacity gap and that it underscores every other barrier relative to rural transit systems, this is a significant issue.The Rural Transit Solutions Fund is just one example of efforts to bolster rural transit that fall short.Missing the markOther funding announcements, as well as the work of the Standing Committee on Inter-City Transportation by Bus, show there's a recognition of the need for rural transit and an attempt to take some steps in the right direction.But there is a continuing misunderstanding of rural realities, particularly relating to available human and financial capacity. Ultimately this puts transit out of reach for many rural areas.There is a clear need for further research to address rural knowledge gaps. In the interim, decision-makers must be cognizant of gaps and biases.When it comes to solutions, the differences among rural communities illustrate the need for solutions that are flexible and account for unique rural realities. And if we want the broad benefits of accessible transportation, we need to fund both the buses and the drivers.

These measures are large, complex and expensive: The next farm bill is projected to cost taxpayers US$1.5 trillion over 10 years.          Modern farm bills address many things besides food, from rural broadband access to biofuels and even help for small towns to buy police cars. These measures bring out a dizzying range of interest groups with diverse agendas.Umbrella organizations like the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Farmers Union typically focus on farm subsidies and crop insurance. The National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition advocates for small farmers and ranchers. Industry-specific groups, such as cattlemen, fruit and vegetable growers and organic producers, all have their own interests.Environmental and conservation groups seek to influence policies that affect land use and sustainable farming practices. Hunger and nutrition groups target the bill's sections on food aid. Rural counties, hunters and anglers, bankers and dozens of other organizations have their own wish lists.As a former Senate aide and senior official at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, I've seen this intricate process from all sides. In my view, with the challenges in this round so complex and with critical 2024 elections looming, it could take Congress until 2025 to craft and enact a bill. Here are four key issues shaping the next farm bill, and through it, the future of the U.S. food system.      The price tagFarm bills always are controversial because of their high cost, but this year the timing is especially tricky. In the past two years, Congress has enacted major bills to provide economic relief from the COVID-19 pandemic, counter inflation, invest in infrastructure and boost domestic manufacturing.These measures follow unprecedented spending for farm support during the Trump administration. Now legislators are jockeying over raising the debt ceiling, which limits how much the federal government can borrow to pay its bills.Agriculture Committee leaders and farm groups argue that more money is necessary to strengthen the food and farm sector. If they have their way, the price tag for the next farm bill would increase significantly from current projections.                Credit: The Conversation             On the other side, reformers argue for capping payments to farmers, which The Washington Post recently described as an \"expensive agricultural safety net,\" and restricting payment eligibility. In their view, too much money goes to very large farms that produce commodity crops like wheat, corn, soybeans and rice, while small and medium-size producers receive far less support.Food aid is the key fightMany people are surprised to learn that nutrition assistance\u2014mainly through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps\u2014is where most farm bill money is spent. Back in the 1970s, Congress began including nutrition assistance in the farm bill to secure votes from an increasingly urban nation.Today, over 42 million Americans depend on SNAP, including nearly 1 in every 4 children. Along with a few smaller programs, SNAP will likely consume 80% of the money in the new farm bill, up from 76% in 2018.Why have SNAP costs grown? During the pandemic, SNAP benefits were increased on an emergency basis, but that temporary arrangement expired in March 2023. Also, in response to a directive included in the 2018 farm bill, the Department of Agriculture recalculated what it takes to afford a healthy diet, known as the Thrifty Food Plan, and determined that it required an additional $12-$16 per month per recipient, or 40 cents per meal.Because it's such a large target, SNAP is where much of the budget battle will play out. Most Republicans typically seek to rein in SNAP; most Democrats usually support expanding it.Anti-hunger advocates are lobbying to make the increased pandemic benefits permanent and defend the revised Thrifty Food Plan. In contrast, Republicans are calling for SNAP reductions, and are particularly focused on expanding work requirements for recipients.Debating climate solutionsThe 2022 Inflation Reduction Act provided $19.5 billion to the Department of Agriculture for programs that address climate change. Environmentalists and farmers alike applauded this investment, which is intended to help the agriculture sector embrace climate-smart farming practices and move toward markets that reward carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services.How the U.S. became a corn superpower.This big pot of money has become a prime target for members of Congress who are looking for more farm bill funding. On the other side, conservation advocates, sustainable farmers and progressive businesses oppose diverting climate funds for other purposes.There also is growing demand for Congress to require USDA to develop better standards for measuring, reporting and verifying actions designed to protect or increase soil carbon. Interest is rising in \"carbon farming\"\u2014paying farmers for practices such as no-till agriculture and planting cover crops, which some studies indicate can increase carbon storage in soil.But without more research and standards, observers worry that investments in climate-smart agriculture will support greenwashing\u2014misleading claims about environmental benefits\u2014rather than a fundamentally different system of production. Mixed research results have raised questions as to whether establishing carbon markets based on such practices is premature.A complex bill and inexperienced legislatorsUnderstanding farm bills requires highly specialized knowledge about issues ranging from crop insurance to nutrition to forestry. Nearly one-third of current members of Congress were first elected after the 2018 farm bill was enacted, so this is their first farm bill cycle.I expect that, as often occurs in Congress, new members will follow more senior legislators' cues and go along with traditional decision making. This will make it easier for entrenched interests, like the American Farm Bureau Federation and major commodity groups, to maintain support for Title I programs, which provide revenue support for major commodity crops like corn, wheat and soybeans. These programs are complex, cost billions of dollars and go mainly to large-scale operations.Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack's current stump speech spotlights the fact that 89% of U.S. farmers failed to make a livable profit in 2022, even though total farm income set a record at $162 billion. Vilsack asserts that less-profitable operations should be the focus of this farm bill\u2014but when pressed, he appears unwilling to concede that support for large-scale operations should be changed in any way.When I served as deputy secretary of agriculture from 2009 to 2011, I oversaw the department's budget process and learned that investing in one thing often requires defunding another. My dream farm bill would invest in three priorities: organic agriculture as a climate solution; infrastructure to support vibrant local and regional markets and shift away from an agricultural economy dependent on exporting low-value crops; and agricultural science and technology research aimed at reducing labor and chemical inputs and providing new solutions for sustainable livestock production.In my view, it is time for tough policy choices, and it won't be possible to fund everything. Congress' response will show whether it supports business as usual in agriculture, or a more diverse and sustainable U.S. farm system.

  "text": "Two recent studies indicate that school-level factors play a considerable role in racial disparities in school discipline. The first study, conducted primarily through a series of interviews, reveals disciplinary tensions between district leaders, school administrators, and teachers regarding disciplinary philosophy as well as discretion and accountability in the disciplinary referral process.          The second study, a policy brief, demonstrates through empirical findings the implications of educators' subjective discretions in the disciplinary process, finding that Black students are more likely to be persistently referred and suspended than other students.\"How student behavior is perceived and addressed is one of the biggest challenges afflicting public schools. A more granular understanding of the disciplinary process in schools is key to informing more effective interventions to disrupt discipline disparities. These studies highlight some of the nuances in the sequence from being referred to the office to being suspended in schools,\" said Richard Welsh, author of the studies and associate professor of education and public policy at Vanderbilt University's Peabody College of education and human development. Welsh recently published a similar study on the role of school-level factors in reducing exclusionary discipline.'Navigating tensions in school discipline: Examining school leaders, teachers, and the conversion of referrals into suspensions'Published in the American Journal of Education, Welsh conducted this qualitative study in an urban emergent district in the Southeastern United States. His interviews with school administrators and teachers demonstrate varying disciplinary philosophies that create tensions in the relationships and interactions of school personnel as well as in the processes for handling perceived misbehavior. Principals, assistant principals, and teachers may disagree on the contributing factors of racial inequality in school discipline, how discipline should occur (punitive vs. nonpunitive), and who is most responsible for behavioral management, among other diverging opinions.These philosophical tensions often lead to tensions associated with teacher discretion and accountability in the disciplinary process. Office disciplinary referrals are usually generated by a teacher and subsequent suspensions are decided by a school administrator; however, this study shows that teachers have considerable power over the decision to suspend a student because administrators do not want to appear unsupportive of a teacher's disciplinary decision by not issuing a suspension following a referral.Furthermore, race, gender, and power dynamics among school personnel also influence relationships and interactions that affect the disciplinary process. For example, racial congruence among administrators and teachers may support greater collegiality and cooperation throughout the process, but school leaders and teachers' implicit beliefs about the context and causes of student behavior contribute to racial inequality in school discipline.In discussing the implications of this study, Welsh suggests that to reduce racial inequality in the disciplinary process, teachers may need more structure as well as mentoring and coaching on classroom management and cultural responsivity. This support would improve their discretion in navigating the referral process and help administrators manage teacher accountability. Likewise, districts may need to focus on developing and expanding the professional capacity of school leaders.      'The plight of persistently disciplined students: Examining frequent flyers and the conversion of office discipline referrals into suspensions'Welsh's policy brief, written in collaboration with Luis A. Rodriguez at New York University and published in Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, reinforces findings from Welsh's interviews with administrators and teachers. The brief uses quantitative data from New York City schools to demonstrate how educators' subjective discretions to submit office disciplinary referrals fuel racial disparities in the disciplinary process.In New York City, Black students are persistently referred (meaning referred to the office more than two times in the same school year) and persistently suspended at rates that are nearly twice as high as their share of the student population. They are also persistently referred at nearly twice the rate of other student groups. In particular, Black male students disproportionately receive exclusionary discipline; they account for 14% of the New York City school population, but they comprise 29% of the persistently referred students and 35% of the persistently suspended students.Interestingly, administrators convert referrals to suspensions for all persistently disciplined students at a lower rate (0.66) than for students receiving a single suspension (0.75) in a school year. These data may reflect tensions between the teachers who persistently refer students and the administrators who decide not to suspend them as frequently. That said, the conversion rate of referrals to suspensions for Black students is higher than for other student groups, with Black students receiving a suspension for every 3.2 referrals and other students receiving a suspension for every 3.7 to 4.8 referrals.Taken together, these findings may \"provide justification for concerns that anti-Black racism prevalent in American society is replicated in schools through exclusionary discipline practices,\" write Welsh and Rodriguez. To address these concerns, the authors also suggest that improvements to school characteristics, including fostering a positive school climate and hiring and retaining diverse, experienced teachers, may help to reduce racial disparities in school discipline.

  "text": "John Cleese, the British comedian, once summed up the idea of the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect as, \"If you are really, really stupid, then it's impossible for you to know you are really, really stupid.\" A quick search of the news brings up dozens of headlines connecting the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect to everything from work to empathy and even to why Donald Trump was elected president.          As a math professor who teaches students to use data to make informed decisions, I am familiar with common mistakes people make when dealing with numbers. The Dunning\u2013Kruger effect is the idea that the least skilled people overestimate their abilities more than anyone else. This sounds convincing on the surface and makes for excellent comedy. But in a recent paper, my colleagues and I suggest that the mathematical approach used to show this effect may be incorrect.What Dunning and Kruger showedIn the 1990s, David Dunning and Justin Kruger were professors of psychology at Cornell University and wanted to test whether incompetent people were unaware of their incompetence.To test this, they gave 45 undergraduate students a 20-question logic test and then asked them to rate their own performance in two different ways.First, Dunning and Kruger asked the students to estimate how many questions they got correct\u2014a fairly straightforward assessment. Then, Dunning and Kruger asked the students to estimate how they did compared with the other students who took the test. This type of self-assessment requires students to make guesses about how others performed and is subject to a common cognitive mistake\u2014most people consider themselves better than average.Research shows that 93% of Americans think they are better drivers than average, 90% of teachers think they are more skilled than their peers, and this overestimation is pervasive across many skills\u2014including logic tests. But it is mathematically impossible for most people to be better than average at a certain task.After giving students the logic test, Dunning and Kruger divided them into four groups based on their scores. The lowest-scoring quarter of the students got, on average, 10 of the 20 questions correct. In comparison, the top-scoring quarter of students got an average of 17 questions correct. Both groups estimated they got about 14 correct. This is not terrible self-assessment by either group. The least skilled overestimated their scores by around 20 percentage points, while the top performers underestimated their scores by roughly 15 points.The results appear more striking when looking at how students rated themselves against their peers, and here is where the better-than-average effect is on full display. The lowest-scoring students estimated that they did better than 62% of the test-takers, while the highest-scoring students thought they scored better than 68%.By definition, being in the bottom 25% means that, at best, you will score better than 25% of people and, on average, better than just 12.5%. Estimating you did better than 62% of your peers, while only scoring better than 12.5% of them, gives a whopping 49.5 percentage-point overestimation.The measure of how students compared themselves to others, rather than to their actual scores, is where the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect arose. It grossly exaggerates the overestimation of the bottom 25% and seems to show, as Dunning and Kruger titled their paper, that the least skilled students were \"unskilled and unaware.\"Using the protocol laid out by Dunning and Kruger, many researchers since have \"confirmed\" this effect in their own fields of study, leading to the sense that the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect is intrinsic to how human brains work. For everyday people, the Dunning-Kruger effect seems true because the overly arrogant fool is a familiar and annoying stereotype.      Debunking the Dunning\u2013Kruger effectThere are three reasons Dunning and Kruger's analysis is misleading.The worst test-takers would also overestimate their performance the most because they are simply the furthest from getting a perfect score. Additionally, the least skilled people, like most people, assume they are better than average. Finally, the lowest scorers aren't markedly worse at estimating their objective performance.To establish the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect is an artifact of research design, not human thinking, my colleagues and I showed it can be produced using randomly generated data.First, we created 1,154 fictional people and randomly assigned them both a test score and a self-assessment ranking compared with their peers.Then, just as Dunning and Kruger did, we divided these fake people into quarters based on their test scores. Because the self-assessment rankings were also randomly assigned a score from 1 to 100, each quarter will revert to the mean of 50. By definition, the bottom quarter will outperform only 12.5% of participants on average, but from the random assignment of self-assessment scores they will consider themselves better than 50% of test-takers. This gives an overestimation of 37.5 percentage points without any humans involved.To prove the last point\u2014that the least skilled can adequately judge their own skill\u2014required a different approach.My colleague Ed Nuhfer and his team gave students a 25-question scientific literacy test. After answering each question, the students would rate their own performance on each question as either \"nailed it,\" \"not sure\" or \"no idea.\"Working with Nuhfer, we found that unskilled students are pretty good at estimating their own competence. In this study of unskilled students who scored in the bottom quarter, only 16.5% significantly overestimated their abilities. And, it turns out, 3.9% significantly underestimated their score. That means nearly 80% of unskilled students were fairly good at estimating their real ability\u2014a far cry from the idea put forth by Dunning and Kruger that the unskilled consistently overestimate their skills.Dunning\u2013Kruger todayThe original paper by Dunning and Kruger starts with the quote: \"It is one of the essential features of incompetence that the person so inflicted is incapable of knowing that they are incompetent.\" This idea has spread far and wide through both scientific literature and pop culture alike. But according to the work of my colleagues and me, the reality is that very few people are truly unskilled and unaware.The Dunning and Kruger experiment did find a real effect\u2014most people think they are better than average. But according to my team's work, that is all Dunning and Kruger showed. The reality is that people have an innate ability to gauge their competence and knowledge. To claim otherwise suggests, incorrectly, that much of the population is hopelessly ignorant.

  "text": "Scientists have used mitochondrial DNA to trace a female lineage from northern coastal China to the Americas. By integrating contemporary and ancient mitochondrial DNA, the team found evidence of at least two migrations: one during the last ice age, and one during the subsequent melting period.          Around the same time as the second migration, another branch of the same lineage migrated to Japan, which could explain Paleolithic archaeological similarities between the Americas, China, and Japan. The study appears May 9 in the journal Cell Reports.\"The Asian ancestry of Native Americans is more complicated than previously indicated,\" says first author Yu-Chun Li, a molecular anthropologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. \"In addition to previously described ancestral sources in Siberia, Australo-Melanesia, and Southeast Asia, we show that northern coastal China also contributed to the gene pool of Native Americans.\"Though it was long assumed that Native Americans descended from Siberians who crossed over the Bering Strait's ephemeral land bridge, more recent genetic, geological, and archaeological evidence suggests that multiple waves of humans journeyed to the Americas from various parts of Eurasia.To shed light on the history of Native Americans in Asia, a team of researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences followed the trail of an ancestral lineage that might link East Asian Paleolithic-age populations to founding populations in Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, and California. The lineage in question is present in mitochondrial DNA, which can be used to trace kinship through the female line.The researchers scoured over 100,000 contemporary and 15,000 ancient DNA samples from across Eurasia to eventually identify 216 contemporary and 39 ancient individuals belonging to the rare lineage. By comparing the accumulated mutations, geographic locations, and carbon-dated age of each of these individuals, the researchers were able to trace the lineage's branching path.They identified two migration events from northern coastal China to the Americas, and in both cases, they think that the travelers probably set dock in America via the Pacific coast rather than by crossing the inland ice-free corridor (which would not have opened at the time).The first radiation event occurred between 19,500 and 26,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum, when ice sheet coverage was at its greatest and conditions in northern China were likely inhospitable for humans. The second radiation occurred during the subsequent deglaciation or melting period, between 19,000 and 11,500 years ago. There was a rapid increase in human populations at this time, probably due to the improved climate, which may have fueled expansion into other geographical regions.The researchers also uncovered an unexpected genetic link between Native Americans and Japanese people. During the deglaciation period, another group branched out from northern coastal China and traveled to Japan. \"We were surprised to find that this ancestral source also contributed to the Japanese gene pool, especially the indigenous Ainus,\" says Li.This discovery helps to explain archaeological similarities between the Paleolithic peoples of China, Japan, and the Americas. Specifically, the three regions share similarities in how they crafted stemmed projectile points for arrowheads and spears. \"This suggests that the Pleistocene connection among the Americas, China, and Japan was not confined to culture but also to genetics,\" says senior author Qing-Peng Kong, an evolutionary geneticist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.Though the study focused on mitochondrial DNA, complementary evidence from Y chromosomal DNA suggests that male ancestors of Native Americans also lived in northern China at around the same time as these female ancestors.This study adds another piece to the puzzle that is Native American ancestry, but many other elements remain unclear. \"The origins of several founder groups are still elusive or controversial,\" says Kong. \"Next, we plan to collect and investigate more Eurasian lineages to obtain a more complete picture on the origin of Native Americans.\" More information:Qing-Peng Kong, Mitogenome evidence shows two radiation events and dispersals of matrilineal ancestry from Northern Coastal China to the Americas and Japan, Cell Reports (2023).

  "text": "Exposure to gun violence is one of the great traumas of American life, but its harms are not equally distributed. In a first-of-its-kind study published Tuesday in JAMA Network Open, a Harvard sociology professor and his colleagues set out to examine exposure to shootings by race, sex, and birth year in a long-term study that followed respondents from childhood up to age 40.          \"The idea here is to take a life-course perspective,\" said Robert J. Sampson, the Woodford L. and Ann A. Flowers University Professor. \"When is exposure to gun violence happening? How does that change over the life course? And how do those patterns vary by race, sex, and all the societal changes that are happening?\"These questions were tackled by analyzing longitudinal data on a representative sample of 2,418 participants from Chicago\u2014half male and half female\u2014who were born in 1981, 1984, 1987, and 1996. Four rounds of data were collected for up to 25 years. All in all, responses underscore the profound tolls on Black and Hispanic communities while surfacing new insights related to gender and birth year.Making this study possible was the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, which Sampson helped launch in the mid-1990s to follow various birth cohorts. \"One of the project's advantages is the ability to disentangle age and life-course differences from what's happening in society at large,\" Sampson said. By now, the social scientist has drawn on PHDCN data for multiple papers and a book, with a forthcoming title arriving next year on the interaction of child and societal development.For this study, Sampson and his co-authors found exposure to gun violence varied depending on when the respondent was born. Overall, exposure rises in adolescence, with 14 being the mean age of seeing somebody shot while 17 was the mean for being shot.\"The oldest cohorts were quite disadvantaged,\" Sampson noted, \"because they came of age during the peak of violence in the United States and Chicago.\" U.S. homicide rates topped out in the early 1990s, just as those born in the early '80s reached their teen years. Around half of respondents born in 1981 and 1984 reported witnessing gun violence, while those who had been shot hovered around 7 percent.      As crime rates declined, subsequent birth cohorts faced less exposure to firearms. Those born in 1996 reported the lowest levels of seeing somebody shot\u2014their exposure was half that of the two oldest cohorts\u2014but direct victimization was another story. \"Surprisingly,\" Sampson added, \"unlike witnessing violence, there was no statistical difference between the 1981 and 1996 cohorts in their risk of being shot.\"\"In 2015 or 2016, violence in the United States, but particularly in Chicago, started to skyrocket,\" explained Sampson, who noted that gun-related deaths peaked in 2021\u2014with nearly all homicides today being gun homicides. \"As being shot tends to happen later in the life course, the youngest cohort all of a sudden faced a much higher risk.\"In terms of race, Sampson's study confirmed previous research establishing racial disparities in exposure to gun violence. Black and Hispanic participants were more than twice as likely to be directly victimized. More than 7 percent of both Black and Hispanic respondents reported being shot by age 40. In fact, one Black PHDCN participant and one Hispanic PHDCN participant were fatally shot. In contrast, 3% of white participants reported being shot.The numbers were similarly stark for witnessing gun violence. Fifty-six percent of Black respondents and 55 percent of Hispanics reported seeing someone shot, compared with 25 percent of whites.\"You also see differences in the age distribution,\" Sampson noted. \"Gunshot victimization flatlines among the white population after age 21, whereas it keeps rising all the way up to age 40 for Black and Hispanic respondents.\"More surprising to the researchers were rates of exposure by sex, given all we know about men's greater involvement in violence. Men were far more likely to be shot\u201411 percent of male vs. 2 percent of female participants\u2014but the differences were modest for witnessing gun violence (58 vs. 43 percent). For Sampson, this finding speaks to the prevalence of firearms in American life.As a final step, Sampson and his co-authors drew from the Gun Violence Archive to map the proximity of each respondent's residence to shootings. This approach revealed minimal differences by sex and age, but the racial gap again proved glaring.Black residents were far more likely than Hispanic and White residents to live in neighborhoods plagued by shootings, in addition to compounded adversities (like concentrated poverty) Sampson has shown in prior work. \"But perhaps the greatest adversity of all is violence,\" he said.As Sampson pointed out, guns threaten far more than human life. Studies show that witnessing a shooting has long-term developmental and psychological effects that impact education, relationships, and employment. \"The ramifying consequences are profound, which makes gun violence all the more important to pinpoint,\" he said.

  "text": "When the Voting Rights Act was signed into law in 1965, it didn't just enfranchise Black voters in the American South. It also led to greater representation of Black lawmakers in local government, according to a new paper published in the April 2023 issue of the Journal of Political Economy. In \"Race, Representation, and Local Governments in the US South: The Effect of the Voting Rights Act,\" authors Andrea Bernini, Giovanni Facchini, and Cecilia Testa analyze how the law promoted the election of Black politicians to county commissions and other offices in the immediate years after it was passed.          The Voting Rights Act eliminated literacy tests and other obstacles to Black voters' registration, and the legislation required certain \"covered\" jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to adhere to special provisions. Following its passage, Black voter registration and turnout quickly increased. But while civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. hoped the new law would lead to more Black representation in elected office, the actual delivery of this effect remained unclear. As Bernini, Facchini, and Testa put it: \"Did the VRA live up to its promise?\"To answer this question, the authors embarked on the first systematic assessment of the Voting Rights Act's impact on racial representation in local governments in the American South between 1962 and 1980. From the National Roster of Black Elected Officials, they gathered data on African Americans serving on county governments, school district boards, and municipal governing bodies during that period in the 11 states that made up the former Confederacy.The authors then applied two analyses to the dataset. First, they examined how the difference between the preexisting share of Blacks and Black office holding changed over time within counties subjected to coverage. They also analyzed if covered counties with larger preexisting Black populations experienced a larger increase in Black office holding after the passage of the VRA, compared with noncovered counties. \"[W]hile before 1965 Black office holding in all states of the former Confederacy was unrelated to their racial composition,\" the authors write, \"in the immediate aftermath of the VRA, Black representation increased more in counties with larger shares of African Americans, and the gradient of the relationship was clearly steeper for covered counties.\"While Bernini, Facchini, and Testa note that anecdotal evidence might suggest Blacks were elected to only minor offices, they found that coverage significantly increased African American representation in county commissions. The authors call commissions \"the most important local government bodies in the US South,\" as they control local finances, and the authors find that capital spending grew more rapidly within counties electing Black commissioners.Despite the gains made in commissions, the authors did not find similar progress in municipal governing bodies and school boards. These offices were governed by different existing electoral rules, the authors write. Black office holders were elected more in single-member district elections than in at-large elections, in which the majority of a jurisdiction elects all representatives. Still, \"in less than two decades, the VRA significantly changed the racial makeup of local governments in the US South,\" the authors write, noting that other possible consequences beyond increases in local spending remain open to future research.

  "text": "A study by an international team of researchers, led by the University of Southampton, has given an intriguing glimpse of the hunting habits and diets of Neanderthals and other humans living in western Europe.          The scientists examined chemical properties locked inside tooth enamel to piece together how pre-historic people lived off the land around the Almonda Cave system, near Torres Novas in central Portugal almost 100 thousand years ago.Their findings, published in the journal PNAS, show Neanderthals in the region were hunting fairly large animals across wide tracts of land, whereas humans living in the same location tens of thousands of years later survived on smaller creatures in an area half the size.Strontium isotopes in rocks gradually change over millions of years because of radioactive processes. This means they vary from place to place depending on the age of the underlying geology. As rocks weather, the isotopic 'fingerprints' are passed into plants via sediments, and make their way along the food chain\u2014eventually passing into tooth enamel.In this study, archaeologists used a technique which laser samples enamel and makes thousands of individual strontium isotope measurements along the growth of a tooth crown. Samples were taken from two Neanderthals, dating back about 95,000 years, and from a more recent human who lived about 13,000 years ago, during the Magdalenian period.The scientists also looked at isotopes in the tooth enamel of animals found in the cave system. Alongside strontium, they measured oxygen isotopes, which vary seasonally from summer to winter. This enabled them to establish not only where the animals ranged across the landscape, but in which seasons they were available for hunting.                Part of a mandible of an extinct species of Rhinoceros hunted by Neanderthals around the landscape of the Almonda Caves, Portugal. Isotopic analysis showed Rhinoceros were present all year round within about 30km of the caves. Credit: Jos\u00e9 Paulo Ruas             The team showed that the Neanderthals, who were targeting large animals, could have hunted wild goat in the summer, whereas horses, red deer and an extinct form of rhinoceros were available all year round within about 30km of the cave. The Magdalenian individual showed a different pattern of subsistence, with seasonal movement of about 20km from the Almonda caves to the banks of the Tagus River, and a diet which included rabbits, red deer, wild goat and freshwater fish.      The researchers approximated the territory of the two different human groups, revealing contrasting results. The Neanderthals obtained their food over approximately 600 km2, whereas the Magdalenian individuals occupied a much smaller territory of about 300 km2.Lead author, Dr. Bethan Linscott who conducted the research while at the University of Southampton and who now works at the University of Oxford said, \"Tooth enamel forms incrementally, and so represents a time series that records the geological origin of the food an individual ate.\"Using laser ablation, we can measure the variation of strontium isotopes over the two or three years it takes for the enamel to form. By comparing the strontium isotopes in the teeth with sediments collected at different locations in the region, we were able to map the movements of the Neanderthals and the Magdalenian individual. The geology around the Almonda caves is highly variable, making it possible to spot movement of just a few kms.\"Co-author, Professor Alistair Pike of the University of Southampton, who supervised the research said, \"This study shows just how much science has changed our understanding of archaeology in the past decade. Previously, the lives and behaviors of past individuals was limited to what we could infer from marks on their bones or the artifacts they used. Now, using the chemistry of bones and teeth, we can begin to reconstruct individual life histories, even as far back as the Neanderthals.\"Co-author, Professor Jo\u00e3o Zilh\u00e3o of the University of Lisbon, who led the excavation of the Almonda caves said, \"The difference in the territory size between the Neanderthal and Magdalenian individuals is probably related to population density. With a relatively low population, Neanderthals were free to roam further to target large prey species, such as horses, without encountering rival groups. By the Magdalenian period, an increase in population density reduced available territory, and human groups had moved down the food chain to occupy smaller territories, hunting mostly rabbits and catching fish on a seasonal basis.\"The paper \"Reconstructing Middle and Upper Palaeolithic human mobility in Portuguese Estremadura through laser ablation strontium isotope analysis\" is published in the journal PNAS.

  "text": "About 85% of high school juniors want to go to college, according to a new study from the University of Georgia. But one in six think that's not a possibility for them.          Published in the journal Educational Policy, the study found that students with lower grades wanted to go to college but were less likely to believe they could attain a bachelor's degree, as were those attending public high schools. Students from low-income families were also less likely to believe they could go to college, even though they desired higher education.Male and Hispanic students were particularly likely to want to go to college but not expect to actually attend.\"In school, we often put kids on tracks and assume that once a student reaches high school, they're either on the college track or they're not on the college track,\" said Robert Toutkoushian, corresponding author of the study and a professor of higher education at UGA. \"We treat them as if they're stuck on those tracks. And we often focus on the kids who aren't on the college track and try to convince them to go to the other route.\"But I think our work also says you need to keep paying attention to the kids that say they're on the college track because a substantial number of them at some point will fall off that track.\"The researchers found several factors affected students' confidence in their ability to go to college. Taking advanced placement, or AP, courses and completing prep courses for college admission exams, such as the ACT or SAT, made students more confident in attaining higher education.Going on college tours and positive peer pressure from friends planning to attend college also had a positive effect on students' belief in their ability to be successful in college.Students who don't expect to go to college less likely to applyThe study uses data from the 2009 High School Longitudinal Study [HSLS:09], conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics, which is a nationally representative sample of high schoolers from 944 public and private schools who were followed from ninth grade through 11th. The present study focuses on responses from more than 9,650 students' junior year.The researchers analyzed responses to two main questions: \"If there were no barriers, how far in school would you want to go\" and \"as things stand now, how far in school do you think you will actually get?\"Although the vast majority of students aspired to earn at least a bachelor's degree, if not a master's or doctorate, only 74% thought they would do actually do so.As a result, the researchers found those students were less likely to search for, apply to and enroll in college.Of the students who had low expectations for going to college, about half decided to attend a two-year institution. The other half did not pursue higher education.Increasing access to financial aid, academic assistance keyToday's students may have misunderstandings about the affordability of college or their likelihood of succeeding in earning a bachelor's degree, the researchers said. And those students are potentially making life-altering decisions based on that misinformation.\"We should strive to figure out how schools and institutes of higher education can make sure students know about the resources available to make college more affordable,\" said Hee Jung Gong, lead author of the study who is now a professor of higher education at the University of Alabama and a recent graduate from UGA's Louise McBee Institute of Higher Education.Common resources available at most universities, such as free tutoring, student care and outreach centers, and accommodations like disability resource centers, make a bachelor's degree more accessible than ever.While college may not be for every student, the researchers said, encouraging those students who want to pursue higher education to do so and retaining those who say they want a bachelor's degree but fall off the path along the way is key.\"From society's point of view, it's important to try to get more people to get more education,\" Toutkoushian said. \"Not only would they benefit, but we would all benefit from that.\" More information:High School Students' Expectations and College Aspirations: Causes and Consequences, Educational Policy (2023).

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the new research published in the International Journal of Sports Science & Coaching?",
  "answer_squad": " The under representation of women coaches in high-performance sport",
  "text": "In recent years, the popularity of professional women's sports has soared. We've seen the expansion of women's AFL, the creation of the women's Indian Premier League in cricket, as well as things like the 2023 FIFA women's world cup and the 2023 women's rugby league season added to the prime-time television schedule.          However, behind the screen, underrepresentation of women coaches remains, according to new research published in the International Journal of Sports Science & Coaching and led by UNE's Dr. Ben Serpell, Professor Christian Cook, and colleagues Darlene Harrison and Rae Dower.We recently had a chat to Dr. Serpell, Lecturer in the School of Science, to better understand why this situation continues to exist, and the implications it has for elite sports. See what he had to say below.What are the key takeaways from this research?It is really important to realize that diversity brings innovation, and innovation often brings success. However, in sports, diversity is lacking, and we note that if we cannot achieve appropriate representation across genders, what hope do we have to achieve appropriate representation and diversity across other minority groups? This paper is written in the context of underrepresentation of coaches that identify as women, however it highlights that diversity across many groups is lacking.We discuss leadership development and highlight that often we can perpetuate issues that surround underrepresentation of women by singling women out. Development opportunities and programs should be individualized and ensure all people, including people with a gender diverse background, are afforded equal opportunities to take part in development.Finally, we speak about the importance of environment, and are strategic in using the term 'environment' as opposed to culture. Culture is part of the environment. The culture could be \"okay,\" however, other, simple environmental issues, such as appropriate bathroom and changing facilities, may hinder gender diversity progress. Hence, we believe environment is important\u2026not just culture.Why is there an underrepresentation of women and minority groups in elite sports and coaching leadership?There could be a number of reasons for this, most likely related to sociocultural norms. Some related sexism, racism, ageism and other forms of prejudice remains, and I hear many stories of this still occurring in professional sports. However, it is also important to highlight that it is a really hard industry for anyone wanting to commit time to their family across genders. Elite and professional sports does not lend well to 'non-traditional' working arrangements (for example, job sharing, work from home etc.), which is a little paradoxical because often in elite sports there is a requirement to work irregular hours including evenings and weekends.      What are some of the things coaches and performance staff can do to shape change and foster inclusive environments?We need to have leaders within organizations who champion increased diversity and appropriate representation of minority groups. We also need the environment (not just culture) to be more inclusive. We don't speak about this much in the paper, however, anecdotally, we know that men who outwardly demonstrate (what is perceived as) more 'less masculine traits' may be 'penalized' in some work places in terms of development opportunities and progression.What this tells us is that the issue of underrepresentation of minority groups includes problems of the environment. People do not need to be 'fixed' to make them more like an anachronistic stereotype of a coach, rather, the environment needs to adjust to be more inclusive.For all people coming up the ranks, how important is it to have a diverse range of mentors and role models? Are there any specific challenges women may face?The paper clearly states that it is not enough to simply be mentored. Many mentors are great in supporting development, but often there is a need for further advocation. It is important to have sponsors as well as mentors (from within and outside of one's own organization), because sponsors will advocate for you and help you secure opportunities for development and advancement. It is possible in some industries that women tend to be over mentored but under sponsored.What do you hope to see happen in the future in this space, and what areas could be further explored?At the very least, I'd like for this to encourage more conversation about how to increase diversity in elite and professional sports. But, more importantly, I hope this can lead to environmental change, and that it is a great source of information for leaders in sports so that they can understand some of the challenges that women leaders and coaches face.

  "text": "Mass shooters pursuing fame often plan their attacks as \"surprises,\" carefully crafting them in ways that set them apart from previous incidents, which makes them uniquely challenging to prevent.          That is a key finding in a new study from NYU Tandon School of Engineering, about the subset of mass shooters in the U.S. for whom notoriety is a primary objective. The study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).Led by Maurizio Porfiri, NYU Tandon Institute Professor and Director of the Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP), a team of researchers collected and analyzed data from 189 mass shootings between 1966 and 2021, and found that fame seekers\u2014as opposed to those predominantly motivated by personal grievance or revenge, for example\u2014planned their crimes around the novelty of the location and targets.This type of deviation from historical precedent did, in fact, boost the shooters' fame, the research revealed.\"Previously, it was believed that lethality\u2014how many people killed\u2014was the main contributor to mass shooters' fame. Our study found that 'surprise' creates fame even when controlling for lethality,\" said Porfiri. \"Fame-seeking mass shooters are not necessarily attempting deadlier shootings by maximizing surprise. Rather, the data found no relationship between surprise and lethality, either achieved by the shooters in terms of death and injury toll, or sought after by bringing more or deadlier weapons. It is likely that pursuing surprising attacks is perceived as an independent path to fame for these types of shooters.\"Attacks by fame-seekers were about three times more surprising than those from non-fame-seekers, based on a metric called \"surprisal\" that measures how much an attack deviated from preceding mass shootings in terms of the location and targets chosen. Surprisal is a mathematical concept borrowed from the field of information theory, a key engineering area that has a wide range of applications from cryptography to statistical inference, urban science, and robotics.Eight out of the ten most famous mass shootings were perpetrated by fame-seekers, the researchers found. To assess fame, researchers relied on Wikipedia traffic data for pages related to each incident\u2014which indicates how much the public searches for information about the event\u2014rather than the quantity of media coverage an incident generates, a traditional fame measure. Shooters' own documented comments about desiring fame from their acts established their fame-seeking status.This new insight about the novelty of fame-seeking mass shooters' attacks adds urgency to two important preventative strategies, red flag laws and how the media covers these atrocities, said Porfiri.Strong red flag laws ratchet up the legal ability to restrict firearm access for people exhibiting threatening behavior. \"Fame seekers frequently make their intentions known prior to acting, making red flag laws crucial to prevent that sort of crime,\" said Porfiri, who pointed out that increasing security at \"normal\" mass shooting locations will not stop fame seekers who expressly avoid committing their crimes in those places.In fact, the media establishes what is \"normal\" by including precise details about the locations and targets in news stories about mass shootings, said Porfiri, creating a pattern that fame seekers work against. Porfiri said that although reducing details in media coverage of mass shootings could play a role in reducing fame-seeking attacks, additional research would be needed to confirm optimal reporting strategies.The NYU Tandon research team that conducted this research includes Ph.D. candidate Rayan Succar, Postdoctoral Fellow Roni Barak Ventura, former high-school intern Maxim Belykh, and undergraduate student Sihan Wei.

  "text": "Instagram and TikTok are two of the fastest-growing social media outlets in the U.S., offering entertainment and connection to a world-wide community with the ease of a finger swipe. Despite their growing popularity, little research has focused on the association between the specific use of Instagram and TikTok and a person's psychological well-being.          Noted Baylor University smartphone researchers Meredith E. David, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Marketing, and James A. Roberts, Ph.D., The Ben H. Williams Professor of Marketing in the Hankamer School of Business, have investigated the correlation between the \"flow states\"\u2014or happiness experienced by individuals\u2014while using Instagram and TikTok and psychological well-being.David and Roberts published their research\u2014\"Instagram and TikTok Flow States and Their Association with Psychological Well-Being\"\u2014in Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking.The study surveyed 420 U.S. adults to investigate the flow states experienced when using Instagram and TikTok and whether these flow states differentially impact well-being. A flow state is achieved when people are so engrossed in an activity that little else seems to matter to them and they will often continue the activity despite its negative consequences.There are 5 flow dimensions:Focused Attention (immersion while using social media)Enjoyment (fun experienced while using social media)Curiosity (the desire to keep up with what's happening on a social media site)Telepresence (immersion in a world created by the social media experienceTime Distortion (losing a sense of time while on social media)The study determined that telepresence is the key component of flow that drives problematic social media behaviors and addiction. Telepresence for both Instagram and TikTok users was associated with higher levels of addiction, mind wandering, FOMO, anxiety and depression. The study revealed that 28% of Instagram users and 24% of TikTok users in the study would qualify as addicted based upon the diagnostic criteria.These social media platforms may provide an escape from everyday worries, but if overused, they are a poor coping strategy, David said.\"It is likely that immersion in the world created by the social media experience displaces the more meaningful and close interpersonal relationships on which our psychological well-being depends,\" David said.      Differences between Instagram and TikTok usersTypically, the experience of flow is assumed to be similar across social media platforms, but this was not the case with Instagram and TikTok, researchers discovered. TikTok users report higher levels of overall flow, enjoyment and time distortion than Instagram users. A high telepresence was found in 53% of TikTok users but only 38% of Instagram users. This difference in flow composition suggests important differences may exist in how individuals experience flow across different social media platforms.For example, Instagram is more personal in nature. Users post photos and comment on posts within a more intimate circle of friends while TikTok videos are shared with a larger network of friends, followers and often strangers with the primary purpose to entertain and garner likes, comments and shares.TikTok users have fun watching the many short videos on the app, which provides constant reinforcement to continue watching videos. This behavior leads to higher levels of the flow state time distortion. In the study, TikTok users reported they were more prone to lose track of time and spend more time than they had intended. They also reported becoming so engrossed in scrolling through videos that they continued the activity despite its negative consequences.Overcoming negative impactsThe negative impacts of time distortion and telepresence can be mitigated by spending less time on apps. Roberts recommends:Using the screen-time management settings available on most social media apps.Designating a parent, spouse or an accountability partner to help monitor the time an individual spends on social media.Stopping app use after a predetermined amount of time helps strengthen an individual's ability to practice restraint the next time they use social media.Ultimately what determines the positive or negative effects of social media is dictated by the individual user.\"When overused as a replacement for true connections and communications, social media can be addictive and detrimental to well-being,\" David said. \"In small doses it can fulfill curiosity, entertain and even educate. Used intentionally, social media can be a useful tool for connecting with others and fostering established relationships.\" More information:James A.

Low credit scores or resum\u00e9 gaps that dog them for years after the abuse.          A new study from Western researchers highlights the toll of economic abuse on rural women\u2014and their resiliency in the face of it.\"Where someone is located changes the resources they have access to, which changes the way they're going to interact with people. It changes everything,\" said Tara Mantler, professor of health sciences who specializes in women's health.\"When we think about resilience, it's not necessarily someone who has faced adversity and triumphed, so much as someone who is surviving. For women who are experiencing gender-based violence, that is resilience, surviving every day.\"The scope of the problem is staggering.The study cites sobering statistics: 44 percent of all women in Canada who have been in an intimate relationship report some form of violence during their lifetime. That's an estimated $7.4 billion cost between direct services\u2014shelters and police calls, for example\u2014and indirect impacts, such as hospital visits.\"This isn't a small group. This impacts everyone. It's important we start having these conversations and thinking about ways we can change the system,\" Mantler said.As part of their recent study, a team of Western researchers interviewed 12 shelter staff members and 14 women facing gender-based violence, between 18 and 59 years old. All the participants lived in rural communities across the province, some in southwestern Ontario and others as far as Thunder Bay.\"A lot of those really rural-specific issues were brought up by the women as well as service providers, who were grateful we were finally focusing on their experiences, because they know how different they are from urban experiences,\" said Julia Yates, BHsc'21, MSc'23, a researcher on the study.\"Rural communities are smaller, so it is harder for women in those communities to get out of their relationships or get out of the stigma around their relationships, because there are fewer community members and people know each other's business more,\" she added.      The study uncovered factors hindering rural women's resilience, with loss of income high on the list. Some women were able to continue working but had their pay cheques taken or managed by a partner. Others were unable to hold jobs, either as a result of abuse and control exercised by their partners, or due to rural barriers, like little to no public transit. Sometimes they were physically injured and couldn't make it to work.\"Not having a job while in a relationship then impacted them after leaving the relationship because they now had big gaps in their work experience,\" Yates said.Finances can also drive someone back to an abusive partner, the researchers noted. For those who have bad credit or a lack of work history, the path to renting a home or landing a job can be exceptionally difficult.Many realities of economic abuse were exacerbated by the isolation experienced by women living rurally.\"Sometimes we think of abuse as it happens, and then it's done. Those consequences\u2014having a destroyed credit score or losing a job because they couldn't physically show up because they had significant physical abuse or their partner wouldn't allow them to leave\u2014those have lasting economic impacts and consequences that are often amplified in small towns where there are not as many employers, not as many options,\" Mantler said.\"These are cycles that are really hard for women to break.\"The bottom line?Economic self-sufficiency, where a woman isn't forced to depend on her partner for income, cash to meet daily needs, or the ability to work, is a key factor for resilience, researchers found.Mantler and Yates said the solutions are at the same time simple and exceedingly complex, from supporting local agencies to tackling systemic barriers.Investing in the work of shelters is essential, they said, especially since staff are experts in the supports and realities of their own communities.The researchers also hope everyone, from hiring managers to policy makers, will think more deeply about the ramifications of gender-based violence.\"There are a lot people who do not know, and it is really uncomfortable to talk about gender-based violence,\" Mantler said. \"We need to start having these conversations, because there are a lot of people who would be willing to do something, willing to mobilize, if they just knew.\" More information:\"When I Decided to Leave, I Had Nothing\": The Resilience of Rural Women Experiencing Economic Abuse in the Context of Gender-Based Violence, Journal of Rural and Community Development, journals.brandonu.ca/jrcd/article/view/2225/605Citation:Study uncovers toll of economic abuse on rural women (2023, May 8)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-uncovers-toll-economic-abuse-rural.html  This document is subject to copyright.

On the positive side of the ledger, new research shows how AI can help improve the way instructors engage with their students, by way of a cutting-edge tool that provides feedback on their interactions in class.          A new Stanford-led study, published May 8 in the peer-reviewed journal Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, found that an automated feedback tool improved instructors' use of a practice known as uptake, where teachers acknowledge, reiterate, and build on students' contributions. The findings also provided evidence that, among students, the tool improved their rate of completing assignments and their overall satisfaction with the course.For instructors looking to improve their practice, the tool offers a low-cost complement to conventional classroom observation\u2014one that doesn't require an instructional coach or other expert to watch the teacher in action and compile a set of recommendations.\"We know from past research that timely, specific feedback can improve teaching, but it's just not scalable or feasible for someone to sit in a teacher's classroom and give feedback every time,\" said Dora Demszky, an assistant professor at Stanford Graduate School of Education (GSE) and lead author of the study. \"We wanted to see whether an automated tool could support teachers' professional development in a scalable and cost-effective way, and this is the first study to show that it does.\"Promoting effective teaching practicesRecognizing that existing methods for providing personalized feedback require significant resources, Demszky and colleagues set out to create a low-cost alternative. They leveraged recent advances in natural language processing (NLP)\u2014a branch of AI that helps computers read and interpret human language\u2014to develop a tool that could analyze transcripts of a class session to identify conversational patterns and deliver consistent, automated feedback.For this study, they focused on identifying teachers' uptake of student contributions. \"Uptake is key to making students feel heard, and as a practice it's been linked to greater student achievement,\" said Demszky. \"But it's also widely considered difficult for teachers to improve.\"The researchers trained the tool, called M-Powering Teachers (the M stands for machine, as in machine learning), to detect the extent to which a teacher's response is specific to what a student has said, which would show that the teacher understood and built on the student's idea. The tool can also provide feedback on teachers' questioning practices, such as posing questions that elicited a significant response from students, and the ratio of teacher/student talk time.The research team put the tool to work in the Spring 2021 session of Stanford's Code in Place, a free online course now in its third year. In the five-week program, based on Stanford's popular introductory computer science course, hundreds of volunteer instructors teach basic programming to learners worldwide, in small sections with a 1:10 teacher-student ratio.Code in Place instructors come from all sorts of backgrounds, from undergrads who've recently taken the course themselves to professional computer programmers working in the industry. Enthusiastic as they are to introduce beginners to the world of coding, many instructors approach the opportunity with little or no prior teaching experience.The volunteer instructors received basic training, clear lesson goals, and session outlines to prepare for their role, and many welcomed the chance to receive automated input on their sessions, said study co-author Chris Piech, an assistant professor of computer science education at Stanford and co-founder of Code in Place.\"We make such a big deal in education about the importance of timely feedback for students, but when do teachers get that kind of feedback?\" he said. \"Maybe the principal will come in and sit in on your class, which seems terrifying. It's much more comfortable to engage with feedback that's not coming from your principal, and you can get it not just after years of practice but from your first day on the job.\"Instructors received their feedback from the tool through an app within a few days after each class, so they could reflect on it before the next session. Presented in a colorful, easy-to-read format, the feedback used positive, nonjudgmental language and included specific examples of dialogue from their class to illustrate supportive conversational patterns.The researchers found that, on average, instructors who reviewed their feedback subsequently increased their use of uptake and questioning, with the most significant changes taking place in the third week of the course. Student learning and satisfaction with the course also increased among those whose instructors received feedback, compared with the control group. Code in Place doesn't administer an end-of-course exam, so the researchers used the completion rates of optional assignments and course surveys to measure student learning and satisfaction.      Testing in other settingsSubsequent research by Demszky with one of the study's co-authors, Jing Liu, Ph.D. '18, studied the use of the tool among instructors who worked one-on-one with high school students in an online mentoring program. The researchers, who will present their findings in July at the 2023 Learning at Scale conference, found that on average the tool improved mentors' uptake of student contributions by 10%, reduced their talk time by 5%, and improved students' experience with the program as well as their relative optimism about their academic future.Demszky is currently conducting a study of the tool's use for in-person, K-12 school classrooms, and she noted the challenge of generating the high-quality transcription she was able to obtain from a virtual setting. \"The audio quality from the classroom is not great, and separating voices is not easy,\" she said. \"Natural language processing can do so much once you have the transcripts\u2014but you need good transcripts.\"She stressed that the tool was not designed for surveillance or evaluation purposes, but to support teachers' professional development by giving them an opportunity to reflect on their practices. She likened it to a fitness tracker, providing information for its users' own benefit.The tool also was not designed to replace human feedback but to complement other professional development resources, she said.

  "text": "New research finds that female leaders are given the benefit of the doubt when they do not achieve positive results.          While those evaluating the performance of male and female leaders do not attribute positive results differently, they blame the negative outcomes of male leaders on their selfish decisions, while those of female leaders are put down to bad luck.The study, by researchers at the University of East Anglia in the UK, and University of Melbourne and Monash University in Australia, finds that the observed gender biases in such assessments are exhibited by men, and to some extent, evaluators who act in a more prosocial manner, that is, in a way that benefits others.In both the public and private sectors, leaders often make decisions that affect the well-being of others. For example, political leaders make policy choices that affect the welfare of their constituents. In many situations, they face a choice between maximizing their own payoffs and maximizing the payoffs of others. In these types of environments, traditional gender roles or stereotypes might imply that women may be expected to act in a more altruistic way.In this study, published in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, the researchers asked how leaders' decisions are evaluated and whether evaluators are biased in their attribution of outcomes between female and male leaders in such environments.\"Due to society's growing demand for social responsibility, those in leadership roles are under more scrutiny than ever before,\" said Dr. Boon Han Koh, of UEA's School of Economics and Centre for Behavioural and Experimental Social Science. \"As a result, leaders across the board are expected to be aware of their impact on social welfare and engage in more prosocial activities.\"\"The actions of leaders are motivated by prosociality, which in turn have consequences on the welfare of group that they are leading. It is therefore important to understand whether male and female leaders are assessed differently, since the evaluations are likely to affect individuals' decision-making processes.\"      \"We find that positive outcomes of male and female leaders are not treated differently, suggesting that men and women are deemed to be equally altruistic after being seen to achieve positive results.\"\"However, while the low outcomes of male leaders are blamed more on their selfish decisions, those of female leaders are attributed more to bad luck. Hence, in the case of failure, men are assigned more blame than women and perceived as being selfish.\"The researchers used a laboratory setting to measure individuals' perceptions about the actions of others. They focused on a decision-making environment\u2014the type common in many leadership settings\u2014where the actions of leaders affected the welfare of the group they were in charge of.The actions taken by the leaders could not be observed by the other group members, the evaluators, meaning they were judged on the outcomes they delivered. However, their gender was revealed to the rest of their group. The team found biases in the attribution of outcomes that seemed to favor women, but warn this might not be a good thing.\"One interpretation of our results is that male evaluators may see the need to treat female leaders more favorably, therefore giving them a greater benefit of the doubt in the face of failure,\" said Dr. Nisvan Erkal from the University of Melbourne.\"A possible explanation for this is benevolent sexism, which tends to lead to behaviors toward women that are often characterized as prosocial. It is driven by the stereotype that women need to be protected.\"Prof Lata Gangadharan, of Monash University, added, \"Even though biases in the attribution of negative outcomes as observed in our study seem to favor women, such biases may still lead to adverse outcomes for women.\"For example, gender biases in evaluations that favor women may hinder the development of their careers and increase the possibility of backlash against female leaders in the long run. They may also lead to distortions in the incentives provided to all decision makers in positions of power, male and female, and harm the future actions taken by them.\"For the experiment 350 participants were put into groups of three, with one person randomly assigned as the leader who made a series of investment decisions on behalf of the group.The leader faced a trade-off between choosing a costly investment which led to a positive outcome (high payoff) for the group, or a less costly investment which had a higher chance of a negative outcome (low payoff) for the group.Therefore, the leader could either act prosocially (costly investment which increases the group's chance of getting a positive outcome), or selfishly (less costly investment which increases the group's chance of getting a negative outcome).The research is published in the SSRN Electronic Journal.

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the cutoff age for single parenting payments in Australia?",
  "answer_squad": " eight",
  "text": "As the government weighs up whether to extend single parenting payments to parents of children older than the present cutoff age of eight in this week's budget, new information has come to light about what happened when the rules were tightened in 2013.          When then-Treasurer Peter Costello reduced the cutoff age from 16 in 2006, forcing single parents who hadn't found work onto (much lower) unemployment benefits, he said it would \"help them with higher incomes and better participation in mainstream economic life\".A few years later when then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced plans to remove a loophole that had allowed some parents with children over eight to continue receiving the payments, her treasurer Wayne Swan said it would \"encourage re-entry into the workforce\".Did the cutoff improve or harm lives?Only now does recently available administrative data allow us to evaluate how single mothers fared after losing the payment when their children turned eight. Did they secure employment? Did they get higher incomes as a result of being pushed into work, or did their incomes sink?Research Bob Breunig and I conducted on the changes enacted in 2013 finds that when taken together, the single mothers (they were overwhelmingly mothers) lost income.On one hand, the change shifted a sizeable minority (about one-third) of single mothers off income support and into employment, boosting their incomes.On the other hand, it left the majority on income support and on lower incomes\u2014an effect that overwhelmed the increased incomes for those who left the payment and found jobs.Multiple barriers to returning to workWhat differentiates the (reduced income) majority from the (increased income) minority? While our particular dataset cannot identify characteristics that distinguish them from each other, there are two likely explanations.First, individuals who have been on income support for long times tend to face multiple barriers to getting back to work, including illness and/or disability. In the case of single mothers, that illness or disability can also apply to their children.Second is something more pernicious: domestic violence.A personal safety survey conducted shortly after the Gillard changes found 60% of single mothers who had ever had a partner had experienced partner violence in their lifetimes \u2014an astonishingly high figure.If domestic violence underlies welfare dependence among single mothers (and it likely does), it doesn't take rocket science to appreciate the difficulty of getting those mothers into work.Single parents face greater financial constraints relative to dual-income households and greater constraints on their time, in terms of school pick-ups, drop-offs, sick days and things such as help with homework.Domestic violence tightens these constraints, adding to demands on time and resources the need to find safe lodging, attend court hearings, and especially, as victims of trauma, care for their own (as well as their children's) mental and physical health.The trauma engendered by domestic violence can also be very difficult to escape when it is triggered at every custodial hearing, divorce proceeding, non-custodial parental visitation or on the days child support payments are due.So what are the policy solutions?First, increases in employment, unaccompanied by increases in income, appear to have deleterious impacts on children. Insofar as mutual obligations lead to unstable and poorly remunerated employment, they are counterproductive and detrimental.Our research shows that additional mutual obligations did little to improve the employment outcomes of single mothers.Second, individuals facing multiple barriers need tailored support that identifies and helps address multidimensional challenges.      The effect of domestic violence is hard to pin downScaling up individualized support can prove challenging, which is where case management experiments at the local level can help. The new treasury evaluation unit will be in a good position to ensure these policies are designed to be evaluated and assess their results.As importantly, we need to be able to measure the impact of domestic violence on the economic security, employment and health outcomes of survivors and their children over time, as is done in countries like Finland.The datasets needed to do this in Australia already exist, but so far the government has not allowed the linkage of longitudinal data on domestic violence and labor market outcomes.Without the information that would come from putting these datasets together, Australia risks introducing policies, including those designed to assist single mothers who are victims of domestic violence, without a means of evaluating their effectiveness.Single mothers \u2014whether in paid employment or not\u2014are among the hardest-working members of our society. They deserve better. Provided byThe Conversation  This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

  "text": "Uganda's anti-homosexuality bill, if signed into law, could lead to the withdrawal of foreign aid and threaten goals to end HIV/AIDS by 2030, advocates warn.          Uganda's parliament passed the revised Anti-Homosexuality Act (AHA), which criminalizes homosexual conduct, with minimal amendments last week (2 May).The legislation was first passed at the end of March but revised in April after President Yoweri Museveni returned it to parliament for amendments.The bill includes a punishment of life imprisonment for same-sex sexual conduct and up to ten years behind bars for attempted same-sex sexual acts. It also imposes the death penalty for \"aggravated homosexuality\" and criminalizes the \"promotion\" of homosexuality, which many people fear will encourage homophobia.UNAIDS had warned that passing the bill into law would jeopardize progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS and undermine fundamental human rights including the right to health and the right to life.\"Uganda's new Anti-Homosexuality bill is an outrage,\" said Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS.\"Access to timely and quality health care is a human right\u2014sexual orientation should not determine one's rights.\"Anne Githuku-Shongwe, director of the UNAIDS support team for eastern and southern Africa, said Uganda had made \"excellent progress\" in tackling the AIDS pandemic. \"This new bill, if passed into law, would undercut that progress,\" she warned.Human rights 'disaster'According to a study published in The Lancet, HIV prevalence is significantly higher among men who have sex with men (MSM) and in African countries with laws that criminalize same sex relationships.\"If it becomes law, it will increase stigma and discrimination against LGBTQ [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer] people and men who have sex with men, further limiting prevention and treatment services,\" said Richard Lusimbo, director-general of Uganda Key Populations Consortium, a human rights organization.Lusimbo explained that the bill, if passed into law, would be a disaster to the human rights of LGBTQ people, to public health and the fight against HIV/AIDS.      The US government has threatened to withdraw funding for Uganda through its President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) if the law is passed.\"At this time, we are reviewing the possibility that the AHA, if signed, might prevent us from providing lifesaving prevention, care and treatment services equitably to all Ugandans receiving PEPFAR support,\" said a U.S. State Department spokesperson.PEPFAR's annual HIV/AIDS response investment in Uganda is about US$400 million.Despite the pressure from the U.S. and other governments, there is speculation that President Museveni will most likely sign the bill into law. However, the power of ascension of a bill does not lay primarily with the president.The Ugandan parliament can also pass the bill into law if the president does not assent to or veto a bill after it is passed by parliament within 30 days or if the bill is returned to parliament twice.In his speech on April 22, at conference themed \"Protecting African culture and family values,\" President Museveni thanked members of the Ugandan parliament for passing the bill.\"It is good that you rejected the pressure from the imperialists,\" he said, reflecting his support for what has been described by activists and advocates as a draconian law.The bill is setting the pace for other African nations as countries like Kenya, Tanzania, Ghana and others indicate readiness to introduce similar bills in solidarity with Uganda.Charles Brown, executive director of Preventive Care International (PCI), a Ugandan non-governmental organization that focuses on HIV, says the bill is harsh and not well thought through. He fears it will further entrench inaccessibility of health services for people in same sex relationships.\"Already, the landlady of one of my offices in western Uganda called me saying that she was told that our organization promotes homosexuality and she is scared of being arrested,\" Brown told SciDev.Net, fearing eviction.\"We hope that the president doesn't sign it into law,\" he added.

  "answer_squad": " whether the government's actions compromise the needs of future generations",
  "text": "Social scientists worry that too often we think only of ourselves.          \"There's been an increasing recognition that over the last few decades the economy and society have become incredibly focused on the individual, to the detriment of our social fabric,\" says Lily L. Tsai, the Ford Professor of Political Science at MIT.Tsai, who is also the director and founder of the MIT Governance LAB (MIT GOV/LAB) and is the current chair of the MIT faculty, is interested in distributive justice\u2014allocating resources fairly across different groups of people. Typically, that might mean splitting resources between different socioeconomic groups, or between different nations.But in an essay in the journal Daedalus, Tsai discusses policies and institutions that consider the needs of people in the future when determining who deserves what resources. That is, they broaden our concept of a collective society to include people who haven't been born yet and will bear the brunt of climate change in the future.Some groups of people do actually consider the needs of future people when making decisions. For example, Wales has a Future Generations Commissioner who monitors whether the government's actions compromise the needs of future generations. Norway's Petroleum Fund invests parts of its oil profits for future generations. And MIT's endowment \"is explicitly charged\" with ensuring that future students are just as well-off as current students, Tsai says.But in other ways, societies place a lower value on the needs of their descendants. For example, to determine the total return on an investment, governments use something called a discount rate that places more value in the present return on the investment than the future return on the investment. And humans are currently using up the planet's resources at an unsustainable rate, which in turn is raising global temperatures and making earth less habitable for our children and our children's children.The purpose of Tsai's essay is not to suggest how, say, governments might set discount rates that more fairly consider future people. \"I'm interested in the things that make people care about setting the discount rate lower and therefore valuing the future more,\" she says. \"What are the moral commitments and the kinds of cultural practices or social institutions that make people care more?\"      Tsai thinks the volatility of the modern world and anxiety about the future\u2014say, the future habitability of the planet\u2014make it harder for people to consider the needs of their descendants. In Tsai's 2021 book \"When People Want Punishment,\" she argues that this volatility and anxiety make people seek out more stability and order.\"The more uncertain the future is, the less you can be sure that saving for the future is going to be valuable to anybody,\" she says. So, part of the solution could be making people feel less unsettled and more stable, which Tsai says can be done with institutions we already have, like social welfare systems.She also thinks the rate at which things change in the modern world has hurt our ability to consider the long view. \"We no longer think in terms of decades and centuries the way in which we used to,\" she says.MIT GOV/LAB is working with partners to figure out how to experiment in a lab setting with developing democratic practices or institutions that might better distribute resources between current people and future people. That would allow researchers to assess if structuring interactions or decision-making in a particular way encourages people to save more for future people.Tsai thinks getting people to care about their descendants is a problem researchers can work on, and that humans have a natural inclination to consider the future. People have a desire to be entrusted with things of importance, to leave a legacy, and for conservation.\"I think many humans actually naturally conserve things that are valuable and scarce, and there's a strange way in which society has eroded that human instinct in favor of a culture of consumption,\" she says. We need to \"re-imagine the kinds of practices that encourage conservation rather than consumption,\" she adds. More information:Lily L.

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the paper published by Hsieh?",
  "answer_squad": " How informative are insider trades and analyst recommendations?",
  "text": "In the collective effort to set accurate prices, financial markets look to two main gestures from the experts: analyst recommendations, and corporate insiders' buying and selling of their own company's stock. We know that these two groups are aware of one another; in fact, associations between them can sometimes be questionably cozy.          For investors and market observers, this raises the question: Are analysts and corporate insiders in harmony, or dialogue? Is there any added value to considering the decisions of both, as opposed to just one? Jim Hsieh, associate professor of finance at George Mason University School of Business, says that \"most finance papers talk about the so-called 'substitution hypothesis'\u2013analyst and insider information tend to substitute for one another.\"However, Hsieh's recently published paper in the Journal of Banking & Finance (co-authored by Lilian Ng of York University and Qinghai Wang of University of Central Florida) finds that these two camps of experts often behave in opposite ways, fueled by an apparent direct\u2013yet one-way\u2013interaction that holds meaning for investors.Hsieh and his co-authors compared analyst recommendations covering thousands of firms to insider transactions (harvested from SEC filings) for the same companies over the period 1994-2016. After controlling for attributes like firm size and share price momentum that might otherwise motivate analyst/insider behavior, the researchers could see a general pattern in the response of corporate insiders to changes in analyst ratings.\"Insiders and analysts tend to disagree, most of the time,\" Hsieh says. \"When analysts upgrade, insiders tend to sell and vice versa. If analysts and insiders have the same information, their actions should be in the same direction, but we don't see that.\"The paper speculates that insiders purchase their company's downgraded stock to send a contrasting signal to the market, in hopes that it will cancel out the negative assessment from the analyst. There was a direct relationship between the size of the downgrade and the amount of stock insiders purchased, implying a signaling intent.On average, the signaling strategy worked, resulting in a 0.33 percent boost in monthly abnormal returns. And because returns remained elevated three to six months after the insider purchase, the signals seemed to convey genuine information about the company's strengths, rather than being a smoke-and-mirrors attempt to manipulate the market.      \"If there's no information to support the transaction, the price will drop,\" Hsieh says. \"But we don't really see that. The stock price continues to rise. It's not consistent with the idea that insiders buy the stock to temporarily bolster the price.\"The reverse situation, in which insiders sold stock following an analyst upgrade, could also have a signaling motivation. Insiders looking to cash in or diversify their portfolio may find the post-upgrade period a good time to sell, since the analyst thumbs-up may dampen the negative signal broadcast by the sale.When insiders echoed analysts' signals\u2013selling after a downgrade, or buying after an upgrade\u2013the positive/negative effect on the share price was significantly heightened. For Hsieh, this is yet more evidence against the substitution hypothesis\u2013if the two signals were redundant, their agreement would have little to no impact on prices.Interestingly, analysts\u2013unlike the broader investor community\u2013did not appear to heed the signals embedded within insider transactions. Whether insiders bought or sold stock did not affect analysts' subsequent change in the rating of the company. The public conversation between analysts and insiders turned out to be one-sided, as analysts' attention was apparently elsewhere.\"Analysts have been widely criticized for ignoring important signals that could move stock prices,\" Hsieh says. \"We don't know why analysts don't take advantage of the signals from insiders' trades. But we are not surprised by our results since other finance studies have shown that analysts only use a limited number of signals, such as momentum, firm size, and some accounting measures. But it is still puzzling that they ignore one of the most obvious signals (insiders' trades) that could significantly improve their recommendations.\"Still, changes in analyst ratings, in and of themselves, provided informative cues to the market\u2013particularly downgrades, which were associated with a 0.18 percent decline in monthly returns.In Hsieh's opinion, this research suggests that despite close professional relationships that may exist between analysts and senior leaders, the two camps use discrete data-sets to make decisions. \"Analysts provide value-pertinent information to the markets through analyzing public information while insiders are likely to exploit private information,\" the paper states. Ironically, this diversity of focus benefits the market on the whole, even as the mixed signals it creates may complicate investor choices.\"Investors need to look at how insiders and analysts interact and how they behave in response to each other,\" Hsieh says. \"They need to pay special attention to insider buy-in, which is such an important signal. We also have to look at why insiders sell, but that's less informative than insider buying.\" More information:Jim Hsieh et al, How informative are insider trades and analyst recommendations?, Journal of Banking & Finance (2023).

  "answer_squad": " Homophily",
  "text": "Homophily is the notion that humans tend to preferentially interact and connect with individuals who are like them in some way. In other words, it's the idea that \"birds of a feather flock together.\" While traditional research focuses on measuring homophily from the perspective of two-way relationships, such as ones encoded by friendship links in a social network, many human interactions are inherently group interactions and standard tools for measuring homophily do not apply in these settings.          Dr. Nate Veldt, assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University, along with his collaborators from Cornell University, Dr. Austin R. Benson and Dr. Jon Kleinberg, have developed a mathematical framework using hypergraphs to measure and define homophily in social group interactions.\"While research on homophily has already been very influential in helping us understand connections and interactions from the perspective of two-way interactions and relationships, society is full of multiway interactions and a lot of early research in sociology was focused on understanding how homophily affects group formation and group interactions,\" said Veldt. \"Providing clearer mathematical measures and computational tools for quantifying homophily in group settings allows us to better address this original motivation for studying homophily.\"The team's findings have been published in the journal Science Advances.Rooted in the social sciences, homophily is studied because it serves as a fundamental principle that governs how people interact, behave and connect with one another. It also partially explains how we form friendships and how and why we connect with one another. Those connections are based on various factors such as age, race, gender, education level, religion, aspirations or attitudes.\"If you think of friendships, homophily does not mean I only ever befriend one type of person,\" said Veldt. \"But if, for example, I disproportionately form friendships with other people of my same age\u2014more than you would expect at random\u2014then you'd say I'm expressing homophily with respect to age in my friendships.\"Previous measures of homophily use a graph model for human interactions. A graph is a mathematical structure that encodes a set of objects (called the nodes) and a set of pairwise relationships between those objects (called edges). For example, edges in a graph can encode the fact that two people are friends in a social network or that one person sends an email to another person.      Graph-based homophily research has been influential in helping researchers understand human connections and interactions. However, looking at society, many of our interactions occur in group settings, such as participating in collaborations at work, conversations on social media or volunteering at events. Graph models do not include valuable information about the size and makeup of the groups people participate in.There has been a recent surge of interest in modeling different types of complex systems and datasets using hypergraphs, a generalization of graphs that can directly encode multiway relationships. A hypergraph is made up of a set of nodes representing what is being studied and hyperedges, each of which encodes a multiway relationship shared by a group of (possibly more than two) nodes. For example, in a dataset encoding cooking recipes, each ingredient would be a node, and the recipe is the multiway relationship (a hyperedge) that brings them together.\"We have these big, rich modern datasets that are encoding these sorts of multiway relationships, and researchers are finding that a hypergraph can be a very useful way to model a collection of interactions and relationships involving more than two actors at once,\" said Veldt.Using hypergraphs, Veldt and his collaborators developed ways to measure notions of group homophily that cannot be captured by graphs. For example, their framework provides one measure of majority homophily, which is the tendency to participate in group interactions where at least a majority of group participants share a certain attribute (age, gender, political affiliation, etc.). They applied their framework to reveal natural patterns of group homophily based on gender in academic collaborations and group homophily with respect to political affiliation in legislative bill cosponsorships.Their research also uncovered that there are mathematical properties that are independent of human choices and preferences that must be accounted for in order to properly understand and measure group homophily. For example, some ways to define hypergraph homophily seem intuitive at first and directly generalize existing definitions of graph homophily but are mathematically impossible to satisfy.\"When studying social interactions, it's important to realize the difference between patterns that you observe because the math requires those patterns to exist and patterns that you see because of underlying sociological phenomena,\" said Veldt. \"In other words, you need to know about the math in order to draw proper conclusions about the sociology.\"As for future research, one direction the team could go in is measuring the social mechanism of reciprocity, which is the tendency to return benefits.\"For example, if you reply to my emails, I may be more likely to reply to you. Or if someone gives someone a gift, they're more likely to give back in a similar way in the future,\" said Veldt. \"What does reciprocity look like in group settings? And how do you measure that and study that using new mathematical frameworks?\"In addition to helping researchers understand society better, the principle of homophily has been very useful for designing methods for computational data analysis tasks, such as classifying a set of objects based on their relationships or predicting future interactions. One hope for these new measures of hypergraph homophily is that they will lead to improved methods for these and other tasks in settings where relationships and interactions are inherently multiway.

  "text": "It's often risky to introduce new products to the market. In fact, statistics show that between 40 to 90 percent of new products fail. A key component of product adoption is consumer psychology. While there are a few theories that attempt to explain why certain people are not likely to accept novelties, a new study takes a slightly different approach.          Florida Atlantic University and collaborators developed and introduced a new mathematical innovation model, grounded in psychology, to provide both qualitative and quantitative predictions of adoption trends for new products.The objective of the study was to test the researchers' hypothesis that the most innovative people are making purchasing decisions independently of others, highly innovative people are more likely to adopt when the adoption trend has an increasing rate of growth (accelerating trend), moderately innovative people are more likely to adopt when the adoption trend has a positive rate of growth (increasing trend), and the least innovative people pay attention only to the total number of adoptions when making the purchasing decision.Researchers divided people/adopters into four categories: innovator, early adopter, majority and laggard. They applied their innovation model to predict sales data of 200 products of a supermarket chain over four years. They assigned particular preferences for various adoption trends based on the adopters' psychological profiles and generated forecasts for retail sales. They then compared the performance of their innovation model in predicting sales with two other commonly used innovation models and one financial time series model.Results of the study, published in the journal Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, offer a new psychological interpretation of probably the most popular, existing adoption model used widely in marketing today.Key findings reveal that different adopter groups are looking for particular properties of adoption trends to inform their purchasing decisions and that those properties can be formulated mathematically with testable predictions. Importantly, their innovation adoption model outperformed two behavioral models, and the BASS model, which has become the standard model in business innovation forecasts.Findings point to the evidence of customers' behavior based by these four groups, but more importantly, illustrate the usefulness in quantifying psychological behavior in a general social context, especially with respect to innovation.\"We assumed that individuals' decisions regarding the purchase of a new product are driven by the perceived type of adoption trend,\" said Andrzej Nowak, Ph.D., co-author and a professor of psychology in FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Science.\"Innovators look for new products and try them out first, regardless of what anyone else is doing. Early adopters, who look for new future successful products, try to get them early. They react to the value of the second derivative of cumulative sales when making decisions. The majority are interested in products quickly gaining popularity and are more likely to buy when the first derivative of cumulative sales is high. The laggards see only the total number of adopters, which is cumulative sales, as a convincing reason to buy.\"The authors say that companies that want to survive and flourish in today's fast-changing market need to constantly innovate and adapt to the changing conditions, customers' sentiment, and emerging trends.\"Further research in the area of retail product sales forecasting is extremely important since accurate models of product adoption can help companies reduce waste from unsold products, which in many cases also can affect the environment and decrease storage costs,\" said Nowak.

  "text": "Using dozens of cameras set up throughout Sweden's massive forests, weeks-long live broadcasts of elk and other wild animals, or just as often not much at all, have captured Swedish audiences' hearts.          As three elks timidly approach a lake on screen, comments next to the live feed flood in. \"Go on!\", \"Jump in!\", \"They're beautiful!\" people write before the elk eventually turn back and move away.It's a typical scene from the programme \"Den Stora Algvandringen\" (\"The Great Elk Migration\"), another example of so-called \"slow TV\", where things are just left to happen at their own pace and are an antidote to the stress of everyday life.The genre was originally initiated in 2009 in Norway with the broadcast of a seven-hour recording from a camera attached to a train travelling through the snowy countryside.Aired for a few weeks each spring by public broadcaster SVT on TV and online, \"Den Stora Algvandringen\" attracts a large community that watches and comments on the animals' every move.\"Moose (elks) are called the kings of the forest,\" Ingvar Persson, a regular viewer, told AFP.There are over 300,000 of them in Sweden.Popular\"They are a very special symbol for Swedish people,\" the 61-year-old added.A hunter in his spare time, Persson said he enjoys the slow and natural pace of the show.\"It's kind of relaxing and also fascinating... Most of the time you spend in a forest there won't be that much happening.                A moose cow eats at a moose farm in Duved, Sweden.             \"It's basically wind blowing and you are waiting for something hopefully showing up. You might think that a day spent waiting would be a day lost but it's not,\" Persson said.Launched five years ago, the production has been a major success in the Scandinavian country, with viewers logging a combined 12 million hours in 2022. The latest broadcasts started on April 23 and 2023 looks to be a record year.\"I had no idea it would be this popular,\" producer Johan Erhag said.\"On all the social media, everything is very stressed. There's a lot of music in programmes. There's a lot of speaking. And this is the totally opposite way,\" Erhag explained.Not like Disney\"We can't decide what happens... We don't want to do a Disney programme where everything is perfect. I mean, this is nature, anything can happen. And we really want to show what it is like,\" he added.      The video feed is monitored in real time from a control room lined with screens.Teams work shifts day and night to offer alternating viewpoints from 30 cameras\u2014some of which can be controlled remotely\u2014scattered around the Kullberg region in the centre of the country.In the spring, the region is known to be a popular route for large mammals heading to new pastures.\"Even if it's not a motion forward, there are still many things to look at and it still communicates this feeling of nature,\" Anders Lindberg, a columnist for Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, told AFP.\"It's a form of meditation, which I think for many people is something that they need in their lives, and something they lack for example in big cities like Stockholm,\" he added.\"It's TV, it's show business and it's quite good show business. I think this could be exported to other countries also.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the Italian tourism agency that produced the campaign?",
  "answer_squad": " ENIT",
  "text": "The Italian tourism ministry thought it had a sure-fire way to bring travelers into the country: turning a 15th century art icon into a 21st century \"virtual influencer.\"          The digital rendition of Venus, goddess of love, based on Sandro Botticelli's Renaissance masterpiece \"Birth of Venus,\" can be seen noshing on pizza and snapping selfies for her Instagram page. Unlike the original, this Venus is fully clothed. The influencer claims to be 30, or \"maybe just a wee bit (older) than that.\"But the new ad campaign is facing significant backlash\u2014with critics calling it a \"new Barbie\" that trashes Italy's cultural heritage.The tourist campaign \"trivializes our heritage in the most vulgar way, transforming Botticelli's Venus into yet another stereotyped female beauty,\" Livia Garomersini, an art historian and activist with Mi Riconosci, an art and heritage campaign organization, said in a response to the project last month.The yearlong campaign, produced by national tourism agency ENIT and advertising group Armando Testa, is estimated to have cost 9 million euros (about $9.9 million), according to ENIT CEO Ivana Jelinic.Jelinic said that the campaign was designed for overseas markets to attract younger tourists. The online Venus launched in Italy on April 20 and made her international debut in Dubai at the Arabian Travel Market earlier this week.\"We liked the idea that it would be a work of art that is timeless,\" Jelinic told The Associated Press, adding that Botticelli's Venus \"seemed to us like a immortal icon who could represent Italy well.\"Already the new Venus has been memed mercilessly online, appearing among trash bins, alongside Mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro, and in other less-than godly places.The criticism extends beyond the use of a masterpiece to the manner in which the campaign was orchestrated, including its use of stock images and other gaffes like a promotional video featuring a winery in Slovenia, used as a stand-in for Italy.                People watch on a computer monitor the latest Italian Ministry of Tourism nine-million-euro campaign showing Botticelli's Venus depicted as a virtual influencer in Rome, Wednesday, May 3, 203. A nine-million-euro advertising campaign by Italy\u2019s conservative government that has transformed \u201cThe Birth of Venus,\u201d painted by Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli in Florence around 1485, into a virtual influencer has met with widespread derision. Credit: AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia             An even greater sin for many is the campaign's slogan, \"Open to Meraviglia\" (Open to Wonder), because it mixes English into an Italian tourist campaign even as the country's government seeks to protect the Italian language as a pillar of its culture.There are other language faux pas.      On the campaign's website, an automatic translator turned Brindisi, a southern Italian port town, into its literal English definition: \"Toast,\" according to Matteo Flora, a professor at the University of Pavia. That part of the website has now been obscured.\"Let's not talk about the creativity point of view,\" said Flora, \"You may like (the campaign) or not, but on a technical point of view, it has been... a sort of avalanche of problems.\"That includes a failure to secure domains, allowing anyone to snatch the material and mock the project with it.Flora said the campaign also wasted money. The campaign's creative team chose to use the \"intelligence of human creativity,\" rather than artificial intelligence, to build the virtual Venus\u2014but Flora showed how he could quickly come up with a similar campaign using AI at a cost of 20 euros. His social media posts have been shared by thousands of people.The use of a likeness of Botticelli's masterpiece has been lambasted by art historians as well, who say it vastly diminishes the beauty and mystery of the 15th century original.\"Perhaps Botticelli would not be happy about this,\" said Massimo Moretti, a professor of art history at the University of Rome, Sapienza.Any use of an iconic image like the \"Birth of Venus\" risks striking a cultural nerve, marketing experts say.

Credit: AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia             \"The more you try to alter something that's historic, probably the greater the outcry,\" said Larry Chiagouris, professor of marketing at Pace University's Lubin School of Business.\"People are going to say, 'You're changing the culture. You're changing who we are, because it's part of our history,'\" Chiagouris added.\"I didn't like the fact that they used the Botticelli Venus like that, since it is a piece of art,\" Riccardo Rodrigo, a high school student in Rome, said. \"They made it something social friendly to amuse Gen Z, I think it was unnecessary since it can be used just like it is and not modified like they did.\"The Uffizi Galleries, which houses Botticelli's \"Birth of Venus\" in Florence, declined to comment on the campaign.For the creators of the campaign, however, any press is good press.\"It has become so viral,\" said Jelinic of ENIT, adding that \"web users have made her come alive\" even when placing the new Venus in unglamorous places.\"I find (it) interesting in terms of social communication,\" Jelinic said. \"Our campaign is more appealing than (critics) want to admit.\"Tourism officials plan to expand the campaign through the use of billboards as well as video screens in airports and railways.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

  "text": "An international team of researchers has recovered DNA from the owner of a deer-tooth pendant that was buried inside a remote Siberian cave for tens of thousands of years.          In research published in Nature, Elena Essel of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany and colleagues detail how they developed a new technique to extract DNA left behind on an artefact.In much the same way police solve crimes using \"touch DNA\"\u2014DNA recovered from skin cells or trace bodily fluids left behind when somebody touches an object\u2014archaeologists will now be able to recover genetic traces of ancient humans from the artefacts they left behind.These traces will reveal the biological sex and genetic ancestry of the individual who once held or wore a particular artefact, allowing archaeologists to link genetic and cultural evidence as they attempt to unravel the deep past.Prehistoric artefacts and touch DNAWhen archaeologists find artefacts such as tools and ornaments at a site, it's not easy to work out who used them.Until now, we have had to rely on finding artefacts in \"direct association\" with buried people. That is, we could only link an individual to an ornament if we found them buried wearing it.                Elena Essel working on the pierced deer tooth discovered at Denisova Cave. Credit: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology             Even then, this funerary association isn't always a guide to what happened in life. The dead are buried with things their community think they should have, which may not have been theirs when they were alive.This new method of ancient DNA extraction provides a more direct way of determining who used specific items in everyday life.The method can only be used for artefacts made from bone or tooth as these materials are porous and can soak up human DNA from repeated contact with bodily fluids (sweat, blood, saliva). Luckily, the bones and teeth of animals (and sometimes humans) were widely used throughout the past to create everyday tools, sacred items, and personal adornment.These osseous artefacts were held in the hand or worn against the body for extended periods, resulting in sweat and other fluids soaking into their surfaces over time. As a result, the artefact records the genetic information of the wearer.Through experimentation with different techniques, Essel and her team found a way to recover that DNA record in a form that is intact enough to be read.                Over the millennia, Denisova Cave has been inhabited by Homo sapiens as well as our extinct cousins the Neanderthals and Denisovans. Credit: Richard G. Roberts             Is this yours?Using this new method of DNA extraction, the researchers were able to extract a wealth of archaeological information from a single tooth pendant recovered from the famous archaeological site of Denisova Cave in Siberia.The cave, tucked away in the foothills of the Altai mountains, has fascinated researchers for decades as its past inhabitants included not only Homo sapiens but also Neanderthals and another enigmatic extinct human species known as Denisovans.First, they were able to extract the DNA of the animal the tooth belonged to, a wapiti deer (Cervus canadensis).They were then able to extract human DNA from the pores of the tooth and deduce that this DNA had come from a female individual whose ancestry is most similar to ancient people found further east in Siberia and with Native Americans.DNA found in soil, or \u201cenvironmental DNA\u201d, can also inform our understanding of who used an archaeological site such as Denisova Cave.They were also able to use the DNA data to estimate the date of the pendant's creation, somewhere between 19,000 and 25,000 years ago. This date fits with previous radiocarbon dating of the layer of the cave floor sediment in which the artefact was found.Without the extraction and analysis of the human DNA held in the tooth, archaeologists would have been able to tell what animal it had come from and how old it was. However, we could never have guessed the owner of this ornament. Now we can identify a specific individual.Using the additional DNA information attached to individual artefacts, archaeologists will be able to create an understanding of past societies with a level of detail never before possible.

  "text": "Finding a full-time faculty job can be a daunting challenge for doctoral graduates. University of Cincinnati anthropologist Kathleen Grogan says postdoctoral researchers can benefit from having peers review their applications.          She learned this herself while working as a postdoctoral researcher. She realized that she and other postdocs routinely solicited feedback in an online messaging app dedicated to aspiring scientists.\"I was on the job market and wanted people with broad scientific expertise to look at my stuff,\" said Grogan, an assistant professor in UC's College of Arts and Sciences. \"And I saw there were repeated requests on the Slack channel asking people to look at their applications, too.\"So she set up a pilot program that invited postdoctoral researchers to review each others' job application packages. These documents include a curriculum vitae, cover letter and research, teaching and diversity statements.She wrote about the pilot program in a study published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.Postdoctoral research is a bit like career purgatory\u2014a weigh station between defending a doctoral dissertation and accepting that first academic faculty position.\"It's a precarious existence and you feel it,\" Grogan said. \"A postdoc has to apply for new jobs almost immediately. I was very aware of my last paycheck.\"While a job application might seem straightforward, how qualified candidates present themselves and their work can make all the difference in piquing the interest of a hiring committee, Grogan said.\"In my experience in academia, there is a minimum threshold of competence and competitiveness you have to hit,\" Grogan said. \"Having polished materials can be a critical factor between getting an on-campus interview and not.\"Grogan set up a system where postdoctoral researchers volunteered to give or accept objective critiques with peers. In three years, participants helped review applications of 150 early career academics.Afterward, Grogan and her research collaborators circulated anonymous surveys among the job seeking participants. Most found the program's feedback to be helpful, even among postdocs who were still searching for a faculty position.Study co-author Erin Kane, a scientific program manager at Boston University, took advantage of the peer review network. While she hasn't landed a faculty position yet, she took comfort in knowing she wasn't alone.      \"I was one of only a few postdocs in my department and the only postdoc in my lab,\" Kane said. \"Knowing that there was a community of people in my position who were willing to spend time helping me and that I could spend time helping them was really valuable at a career stage that can be extremely isolating.\"The program provided psychosocial support as well, Grogan said. And this is valuable, she said, because a majority of postdocs can get discouraged by an academic job in a field where applicants far outnumber positions. Many pursue careers in government, nonprofits or industry instead.\"The biggest leak is between grad school and the first faculty positions. That's when academia loses people,\" Grogan said.The pilot program helped postdocs see that others were dealing with the same stresses and anxieties of the job search. Postdoctoral researchers often take temporary appointments far from home in places where they have few friends or relatives.\"It gets very isolating and lonely,\" Grogan said. \"You can't associate with faculty because they're your bosses. And senior grad students are working.\"The job search, too, can be discouraging.\"It might take you a year or more to find a job. I applied for 60 jobs and got two offers. It's a lot of rejection,\" Grogan said.Co-author Carlos Guardia, a principal investigator at the National Institutes of Health, said the pilot program gave postdocs a roadmap to success, in part by offering examples of how other candidates were successful in their job search.\"Without a doubt, it helped me,\" Guardia said. \"COVID-19 hit when I was a postdoctoral trainee. I suddenly lost my peer network, so this program was an amazing opportunity for me to find external and critical reviewers for my job applications. I got great feedback on my aims and goals.\"After completing two research fellowships, Grogan in 2020 accepted a joint position in anthropology and biology at UC. Today, her lab studies the genomic diversity of ring-tailed lemurs, among other topics.Grogan thinks her model could be useful to other scientific or academic groups looking to build community.

  "text": "Providing defendants with legal counsel during their initial bail hearing decreases use of monetary bail and pretrial detention, without increasing the likelihood that defendants fail to appear at the subsequent preliminary hearing, according to a new RAND Corporation study.          Researchers found that having legal counsel at bail hearings increased the probability of being released without monetary bail by 21% and reduced the probability that an individual was in jail three days after their bail hearing by 10%.The analysis, based on a field experiment in Pittsburgh where public defenders were assigned to a limited number of initial bail hearings, is one of the few high-quality studies of what happens when legal services are provided to defendants at an initial bail hearing. The findings are published in the journal Science Advances.\"These results clearly show that public defenders have a substantial impact on defendants receiving a favorable outcome at the initial bail hearing,\" said Shamena Anwar, one of the study's authors and a senior economist at RAND, a nonprofit research organization.In the U.S., during the first court appearance after an arrest, a judge makes a decision about the conditions necessary for a defendant to be released from jail until the case is resolved. Most jurisdictions operate a cash bail system in which a judge determines an amount a person must pay to be released from detention.Recent studies have provided substantial evidence that pretrial detention leads to worse outcomes for both the defendant and society at large, with longer jail stays and higher chances of conviction in the short term, and worse recidivism and employment outcomes over the long term.Prior to this study, an open question was whether providing a lawyer at the bail hearing will have an impact on defendant outcomes. While defendants have a right to an attorney at all critical stages of a criminal prosecution, bail hearings are not considered a critical stage in many jurisdictions, in part because they are short, non-evidentiary hearings (often lasting less than five minutes) that are often conducted in an assembly line fashion without much input from the defendant or prosecution.The RAND study analyzes the results from a unique year-long initiative in the Pittsburgh Municipal Court where public defenders were available to represent newly arrested people at some initial bail hearings. The jurisdiction only had sufficient resources to provide public defenders for half of the shifts that did not already have public defenders.      The RAND team created a public defender work schedule such that the shifts in which a public defender was working had defendants and judges who were on average nearly identical to those in which a public defender was not working. This meant the study was akin to a randomized control trial, allowing researchers to rigorously measure the impact of providing a public defender at a defendant's initial bail hearing.The study was in the field from April 2019 to March 2020.Researchers found that while those who did not have legal representation received some type of non-monetary release 49% of the time, those with public defenders received a non-monetary release 59% of the time\u2014a large increase.This reduction in the use of monetary bail in turn led to a decline in the percentage of individuals who were in jail immediately after their bail hearing. In particular, while 45.4% of those without a public defender were in jail following their bail hearing, this percentage was 40.8% among those with a public defender.However, the intervention did result in a short-term increase in rearrests on theft charges among those who had public defenders. Based upon prior survey work that asked people how they perceive the costs of incarceration and theft, RAND researchers suggest that a theft incident would have to be at least 8.5 times as costly as a day in detention for most jurisdictions to find this tradeoff undesirable.\"This study is particularly relevant given that roughly half of the counties in the U.S. do not currently provide defense representation at the bail hearing,\" Anwar said. \"These results should be helpful for jurisdictions that are considering providing defense representation at bail hearings, although more research in this area is needed to understand the extent to which the results we find here are generalizable to other jurisdictions with different bail hearing procedures.\" More information:Shamena Anwar, The Impact of Defense Counsel at Bail Hearings, Science Advances (2023).

  "text": "In August 2020, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced a change in the Fed's inflation strategy: they would be implementing a strategy called average inflation targeting (AIT), which allows inflation to move above and below the target rate of 2% so that it averages out to 2% over time. This differs from the previous strategy of traditional inflation targeting, in which the intent is to return inflation to the 2% target regardless of how long it has deviated from that rate.          But the impact of such a change depends on households and firms understanding the policy and acting in response to it. In the paper \"Average Inflation Targeting and Household Expectations,\" published in the Journal of Political Economy Macroeconomics, Olivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, Edward S. Knotek II and Raphael Schoenle find that the Fed's new AIT strategy had little impact on household expectations\u2014in fact, many people had not even heard of it.The authors utilize data from a daily survey of consumers that has been running since March 10, 2020, weighting the respondents to ensure their sample is representative of the U.S. population. Among standard demographic questions, the survey asked respondents about where and how frequently they saw news about monetary policy or the Fed, about their understanding of the Fed's economic objectives, and what they thought the Fed would do under hypothetical economic scenarios.The survey questions sought to determine if respondents understood that the Fed was using an AIT strategy and how such a strategy worked.In the days following Powell's August 2020 announcement, the authors documented that only 33% of survey respondents reported hearing news about the Fed, with less than half of those people reporting they heard specifically about the Fed's new policy. This increase dropped off shortly thereafter. \"Despite extensive coverage in the news media, Chair Powell's speech apparently did not reach or register with the vast majority of the population,\" the authors write.Along those lines, people who reported hearing news about the Fed in the days after the announcement were no more or less likely than prior respondents to mention AIT as the Fed's monetary strategy. Only about 23% of survey participants correctly identified the strategy after the announcement. And households' broader economic outlooks were the same after the announcement, the authors report, with their expectations about inflation, personal income, and output growth remaining unchanged.The authors wondered if it could take time for households to grasp the Federal Reserve's promise of a new strategy, so they repeated the same survey questions one year later in August 2021. While the percentage of respondents correctly identifying AIT as the Fed's current course of action rose slightly to 30%, \"it remained the case that more households believed the Fed was pursuing IT than AIT,\" Coibion, Gorodnichenko, Knotek, and Schoenle report.Finally, the researchers tested how being presented with information on monetary policy changed individuals' economic outlook. They divided their sample into three groups, giving one information on AIT, one information on IT, and another no information, and then questioned each individual on their economic expectations.The authors find no difference between the responses of the groups who received the AIT or IT information. \"Even when information about the new inflation strategy is presented directly to households and the strategy is clearly explained to them, it does not lead to discernibly different expectations than traditional inflation targeting,\" they write. \"This finding suggests that AIT is unlikely to provide many of the economic benefits that theory often attributes to it.\" More information:Olivier Coibion et al, Average Inflation Targeting and Household Expectations, Journal of Political Economy Macroeconomics (2022).

  "text": "Want to make a positive difference in the wage conditions of developing country factory workers churning out products for multinational firms?          Paying them more seems an obvious first step. But research looking at the experience of clothing retailer H&M Group suggests a less direct approach\u2014by intervening at the management practice level\u2014can empower workers and significantly raise wages in sustainable ways, multiplying the impact of the company's investment many times over.In 2013, following activist pressure for reform, H&M went to its suppliers and asked them to voluntarily implement two programs designed to raise workers' pay. A workplace dialogue program promoted workers' awareness of their rights and formal opportunities for communication between management and workers or their labor representatives.A separate wage management system included the creation of clear and transparent pay grids aimed at fairly compensating workers based on their education, experience, skills and performance. H&M also implemented standardized systems to measure and track workers' wages.Across some 1,800 factories in nine countries, almost all in Asia, wages went up an average of five percent by the third year of implementation. This represented about $44 U.S. per worker annually, compared to H&M's investment in the initiative of $4.57 million\u2014or $1.62 per worker.\"The easiest way to raise wages would have been to just give the money directly to be paid to the workers. But H&M took a long-term approach, where they're implementing systems,\" said Jee-Eun Shin, an assistant professor of accounting at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management. She co-authored the research with Gregory Distelhorst, an associate professor at U of T's Centre for Industrial Relations and Human Resources, who is also cross appointed to the Rotman School's strategic management area.While the wage increase was modest, \"seeing a positive effect is already a huge step forward,\" said Prof. Shin. \"Given the risk, there's a lot of incentive for suppliers not to be part of this.\"Suppliers who adopted the programs remained competitive on prices, yet also saw significant increases in their orders. While the researchers were unable to empirically verify how the suppliers were able to cover the increased wages\u2014there was no significant change in overtime pay or cuts to a supplier's workforce, for example\u2014their anecdotal evidence suggested that increased productivity was a major contributor.Labor union presence in the adopting factories did not appear to significantly amplify the wage effects, the study found. Prof. Shin said this was not especially surprising given the limited power trade unions have in the regions studied.The study also highlights how corporations' social practices can be assessed, using standardized metrics, given that such sustainability measures have been harder to establish, compared to those for things like environmental or governance practices.Prof. Shin credited H&M for being so entrepreneurial with its program, for working to establish appropriate metrics to measure the impact of its wage-related initiatives and for being open with its data.\"A collective approach is needed,\" to improve conditions for workers, she said, \"and corporations like big multi-nationals, if they really want to make a change, they have huge powers to do that.\"The study was published in the Journal of Accounting Research.

  "text": "Sunshine levels have a significant impact on the bidding behavior of stock market investors, according to new research.          The study examined the relationship between sunny weather and how market participants perform, as well as the subsequent seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). These discounts for shares act as an effective tool for companies to raise finance and are essential for a functioning modern economy.To see if decisions were influenced by sunshine intensity and duration, an international team including researchers from the University of Portsmouth's Center for Innovative and Sustainable Finance, examined weather station data to determine the periods when the climate exerts the greatest influence on investors.The data revealed investors made higher bids in sunny periods, which led to lower discounts for shares in the primary market. In fact, just a one standard deviation increase in sunshine intensity caused bid discounts to decline by 2.4%, while a one standard deviation increase in sunshine duration caused bid discounts to drop by 3.33%.Professor Jia Liu, CISF Center Director and Professor of Accounting and Finance at the University of Portsmouth, said, \"With sunny weather, often come good spirits\u2014which in many circumstances is a positive, but that's not the case with financial decision-making. When the sunshine intensifies, bidders become overly optimistic and less risk-averse, which can lead to higher bid prices for seasoned equities.\"Existing research has shown meteorological conditions, especially exposure to sunshine, affects a person's emotional state and sentiment. These weather-driven moods have been proved to influence a buyer's car choice, art prices at auction, and the tendency to take risks in a lottery.It was Edward Saunders who first established a link between investment behavior in Wall Street and the weather 20 years ago.\"Saunders inspired our study,\" explained Professor Liu.\"His results strongly supported the hypothesis that investor psychology influences asset prices. And despite strong evidence that this has a large economic impact, there has since been little research into the relationship between the weather and stock market performance in the primary stock market. Saunders' study only examined stock prices in the secondary market though, so we decided to go a step further and looked at the investor's individual behavior in the primary market.\"      Professor Shenghao Gao, at the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, China, said, \"The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) requires that SEO issuers disclose detailed investor bidding information during the SEO auction process, providing us with a unique opportunity to examine the effect of sunshine-induced mood on investors' decisions in the primary market.\"The team sampled 1,625 auction-style SEOs representing 28,321 bids from 2,978 investors between 2006 and 2019. In addition to a connection between sunshine and a bidder's decision-making, they also discovered that this effect increases when a company's SEO offering is more complex, or its corporate background is less familiar to them.The paper, published in the Journal of Corporate Finance, says the findings have important implications for investors in the primary market, who need to be aware of the impact that weather conditions can have on their investment decisions.Professor Liu added, \"We want to make investors aware that during periods of sunny weather, they become more optimistic about their investments. This will make them more inclined to take risks that aren't justified by asset values. Therefore, they should factor this consideration in when bidding for shares or they might suffer losses.\"The study has profound implications for policy and practice. The growing instability of weather systems throughout the world, and the established connections between climatic conditions and investors' behaviors, makes this an issue of increasing relevance in a financially interdependent world.\"Maintaining the stability of markets could depend upon our understanding of this phenomenon, since the onset of climate change might have an increasingly destabilizing impact on the judgment of investors and market-makers, with unpredictable consequences for global trading.\" More information:Qian Sun et al, Sunshine-induced mood and SEO pricing: Evidence from detailed investor bids in SEO auctions, Journal of Corporate Finance (2023).

  "text": "The coronation of King Charles III has upped the UK's public holiday count this year. The special public holiday on the Monday after the May 6 ceremony, combined with the early May bank holiday and the spring bank holiday at the end, has certainly made for a month of celebrations for many workers.          Normally public holidays in the UK\u2014and in England and Wales in particular\u2014are much more rare occasions. The coronation celebration brings the total to nine in 2023, which is still fewer than any EU country. Given that hours worked in the UK over the whole year are 11% higher than in Germany, for example, it is not clear that working more and having fewer holidays is a sign of economic success.Currently, nine of the top ten most productive OECD countries, measured by GDP per hour worked in dollars, are in continental Europe. Yet this is a region with a tradition of long holidays. There is also evidence that national holidays have a small but positive impact on economic activity, or at least no ill-effect.Having several three-day weekends in one month also brings into focus the recent four-day working week pilots (without loss of pay) in many countries. Iceland led one of the earliest large trials between 2015 and 2019, with its success seeing it rolled out to close to 90% of Iceland's workforce. These people can now request a shorter workweek without any loss in pay.Findings from a New Zealand trial among employees of Unilever also showed strong results against standard business targets such as revenue growth. The vast majority of participants reported feeling engaged and absenteeism dropped by 34% during the trial.A similar six-month pilot program took place in the UK from June to December 2022, involving 61 companies and around 2,900 workers. As with the other trials, organizers said it was a \"resounding success\" for the companies involved\u201456 of these 61 businesses pledged to continue with the four-day week.Paying 100% of the standard wages for 80% of the previous worktime may seem uneconomic, but the UK trial found that the \"vast majority of companies were also satisfied that business performance and productivity were maintained\". Staff retention also improved with the number of people leaving the participating companies dropping by 57% during the trial.      Well-being and health benefitsBut the most significant benefits to employees from these four-day week trials have been in terms of well-being. The UK trial reported that 39% of employees were less stressed and 71% said they had reduced levels of burnout by the end. The average mental health score (on a five-point scale from poor to excellent) rose from 2.95 at the beginning of the trial to 3.32 by the end\u2014an increase of 13%. And in terms of anxiety, 54% of respondents reported a reduction in negative emotions.A similar well-being boost was seen in Ireland's four-day work week trial completed in 2022. Among the 12 Irish companies involved, employees saw a reduction in anxiety and negative feelings and an increase in positive feelings (and expressions of those feelings) throughout the trial.The previously-mentioned New Zealand trial also confirmed the strong positive effects of a four-day week on well-being. Over two-thirds of participants reported a better work\u2013life balance, and measured stress levels dropped by 33% during the trial period.Four-day work week versus public holidaysBut the benefits from four-day week trials are permanent since they accrue from a long-term change in working arrangements, at least during the trial. So, the effects of this year's spate of May bank holidays in the UK could be different.This was certainly shown to be the case by a study that looked at the well-being benefits of national holidays across 200 countries. It found that one less public holiday reduces the probability of being happy by 0.8 percentage points, but that one less public holiday had no impact on the longer-term measure of life satisfaction.But other research shows that, although the positive well-being impact of public holidays may not be permanent, it does lead to an increase in social cohesion or social capital. This brings its own economic and well-being benefits. For all but a minority of the workforce, public holidays ensure that people are using it for leisure time. And social cohesion has long been associated with positive well-being.We need to focus on workplace well-being more than ever. In addition to multiple high profile workplace bullying and harassment scandals recently, calls to employee assistance hotlines are at record highs due to anxiety and depression among employees. These initiatives were designed to meet demand for a range of work-related queries and advice, not to act as an emergency mental health service.And so, the coronation public holiday may give UK workers the much-needed celebration they need. Whatever your view of the Royal family, May's public holidays will benefit the economy, but more importantly, they will deliver a well-being boost for much of the country.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards a basic income guarantee?",

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the organization that provides research on basic income?",
  "answer_squad": " Coalition Canada",
  "text": "Canada's food system is experiencing ongoing stresses from supply chain disruptions, price inflation and extreme weather events. Canadians are feeling the effects of these stresses: in 2021, nearly 16% of provincial households experienced some degree of food insecurity.          Federal programs such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and the recent grocery store rebate point to the impact direct government income interventions can have on ensuring equity in times of emergency, including access to food.Some have discussed the new grocery store rebate, which is to be delivered through the GST/HST tax credit system, as closely aligned with proposals for a basic income guarantee. But a basic income guarantee would involve regular payments, not just a one-time rebate.A basic income guarantee could play a key role in reducing individual and household food insecurity among society's most vulnerable and ensure everyone can meet their basic needs with dignity.What the research saysThere is general support among basic income advocates in Canada for implementing income-tested basic income, which would involve delivering cash transfers to individuals whose incomes fall below a certain threshold.As sustainable food systems experts, we suggest that a basic income guarantee could not only be an important tool for addressing economic access to food, but also in supporting sustainability across the food system.We draw on our research with Coalition Canada, a network of basic income advocacy groups. Our research brought interdisciplinary teams of scholars and practitioners together to develop a series of case studies examining basic income through the lens of different sectors. These sectors include the arts, finance, health, municipalities and the criminal justice system.Our work focused on the agriculture and fisheries sectors and involved members of the National Farmers Union, Union Paysanne, Ecotrust Canada and the Native Fishing Alliance.Overall, our research suggests that a basic income guarantee could have a significant impact on the economic uncertainties faced by farmers and fishing communities in Canada. It could also contribute to a more just sustainable transition in the food system.      Reducing economic uncertaintyOne potential impact of a basic income guarantee would be reducing economic uncertainty for the most vulnerable agriculture and fisheries workers.People employed in food and fish processing and as farm laborers are especially vulnerable to seasonal unemployment, low wages, uneven employee benefits and unsafe working conditions, including high rates of occupational injury and illness.A basic income guarantee could offer individuals more financial security and control over their employment choices, and thus address the racialized, classed and gendered disparities prominent in food systems labor.Supporting new fishers and farmersA second potential impact of a basic income guarantee could be supporting new entrants in agriculture and fisheries. Across Canada, the commercial fishing and farming workforces are aging.Supporting new farmers and fishers, especially those using more socially and ecologically sustainable practices, is an essential part of building a more resilient food system.New entrants face substantial barriers related to high entry costs, such as access to land and equipment or purchasing a boat and fishing license, combined with uncertain and fluctuating prices for their goods.While a basic income guarantee alone can't address these challenges, it could provide greater economic stability for new farmers and fishers when they invest in infrastructure and training.Preparing for future stressorsA basic income guarantee could also be a step towards building resilience against ongoing stressors, like the climate crisis and extreme weather events, along with preparing for future emergencies.The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that those with more stable incomes and flexible work arrangements are better able to adapt to unexpected shocks. For example, during the pandemic, boat-to-fork seafood businesses better weathered seafood chain disruptions because of their adaptable supply chain configurations and proximity to consumers.At present, small-scale farmers and fishers tend to receive the least support, because most subsidies go to larger industrial enterprises. However, these small-scale producers play a crucial role in supplying food for regional and local markets, which can serve as important buffers during times of crisis and reduce the stress of long-distance supply chains.Establishing a basic income guarantee would be a proactive step in supporting equitable livelihoods for small-scale farmers and fishers.Next steps for the food systemAlthough a basic income guarantee has the potential to bring about many positive impacts, it shouldn't be a substitute for existing government-funded agricultural and fisheries programs such as grants, public research, and training and skills development programs.A basic income guarantee also shouldn't replace contributory programs, like the Employment Insurance fishing benefits. A basic income guarantee would offer support to fishers whose earnings are too low to qualify for employment insurance, or who are unable to go out on the water.Further research and policy efforts will be crucial for gaining a fuller understanding of how a basic income guarantee might intersect with other financial supports like insurance, loans and climate funding.Additional research will also be crucial for understanding how a basic income guarantee could support migrant workers brought in through the Temporary Foreign Worker program. Migrant workers are an essential part of fisheries processing and meat and horticulture production.There is also a need to think systematically and holistically about the role of basic income across the food system. The only way to accomplish this is with further input from farming and fishing communities and Indigenous communities in collaboration with anti-poverty, food sovereignty and food justice organizations.We believe a basic income guarantee is a promising tool for contributing to sustainability and justice across agriculture and fishing sectors, while encouraging the development of cross-sectoral networks, research and policy agendas.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards the current teacher shortage?",
  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the main reason for teachers leaving?",
  "answer_squad": " they are satisfied in their jobs and passionate about education and young people",
  "text": "Schools and students around Australia continue to face a teacher shortage.          This means some schools have gone back for term two unable to offer certain subjects. Some might have composite classes, larger classes or disrupted units of study.This also means some students will not have the best possible chance at learning skills, developing a passion for a subject, or achieving their potential.There are already several national and state policy moves to try to address the shortage and its potential causes. As part of these, teachers' workloads, well-being, working conditions and pay have been raised as key factors.Over the past five years, I have studied the career decisions of more than 1,000 Australian teachers across all school years.At the moment, we are trying to solve the teacher shortage without all the key information. Here are four questions we need to answer to really address this issue.1. Who is leaving?We know the teacher shortage is an issue around the country, at all year levels. But beyond this, it's hard to get specific details.One point often lost in discussions about the teacher shortage is teachers are not a homogeneous group: they teach students from the first years of schooling to the last, and specialize in everything from languages to science to music.This means vacant roles are also not homogeneous.In the past ten years there has been concern about shortages of teachers in science, math and languages, as well as early career teachers, male primary teachers and teachers in remote, rural and disadvantaged schools. Each of these groups will not necessarily be retained with the same strategy.There is also a potential mismatch between the supply of teachers being trained in certain areas and the demand from schools.So we need to know who is leaving and what is their expertise.      2. How do turnover numbers connect with reasons for leaving?In the past, teacher turnover research has been dominated by large-scale reports with national data from the United States. These do not adequately connect teacher departures with the reasons for leaving, or necessarily reflect Australian trends.Smaller studies are more common in Australia, especially those looking at teachers' motivations and reasons for leaving. These often rely on hypothetical career intentions only, not real quitting behaviors.This is not enough, as many teachers stay in schools and the profession despite an intention to leave. Decisions to leave are also not always planned.Quitting can be based on time (such as the number of years' service or after earning long-service leave), life stage (such as starting a family), contingencies (such as a promotion or raise), and impulsivity (such as interpersonal conflict).We need to connect how and why teachers leave with who they are.3. Are teachers leaving or simply changing jobs?In a systematic review of the past 40 years of teacher turnover research, I found the majority of past studies did not adequately distinguish between teachers who simply go to a different school, and those who leave the profession altogether.We also need to know who is just moving schools and who is leaving the profession. Policy makers and schools can help develop understanding of shortages by tracking destinations of departing teachers and their reasons for leaving through data collection and exit interviews.This helps work out whether there is a migration issue or an attrition issue.The effect of a teacher's absence on students' learning and schools' operations may be the same. But the shortage solutions are likely to differ for migration and attrition.4. Are we losing 'quality' teachers?In my research, I also reviewed more than 200 quantitative studies with data on teacher turnover and retention. Only one study had a measure of teacher quality.We need to consider the quality of teachers who are leaving and staying. We should worry most about losing high-performing teachers, as opposed to those who were not a good fit for the profession or who left for personal reasons or reasons outside a school's control.We should also be most concerned with teachers who are high-performing, who leave due to a difficult environment. After all, teachers' working environments are the students' learning environments.Involuntary retention of employees\u2014those who want to leave but cannot or do not\u2014is not necessarily preferred to a teacher shortage.We want children's teachers to be in the classroom because they are satisfied in their jobs and passionate about education and young people, not because they are incentivized by another force such as extra pay or a lack of other employment opportunities.What next?A uniform approach to the teacher shortage will not work. Solving it requires matching up teacher types, quitting types and the reasons for leaving, with relevant initiatives for retention.Collecting teacher turnover figures along with information such as year level taught, subject area, location, age, gender and years of experience will help.Schools, school systems and governments should work together to create a fuller picture of who is leaving and why.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards the use of AI in the justice system?",
  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the main concern with AI?",
  "answer_squad": " it will change the roles and skill requirements for lawyers and judges",
  "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming our society. Beyond the currently hyped systems such as ChatGPT or DALL-E, which can generate images, the technology has also found its way into the daily work of lawyers and even judges. At present, such applications are still in their early stages, but AI has the potential to change our justice system. Yet as well as promising significant benefits, it also raises new ethical and legal questions. Most importantly, it will change the roles and skill requirements for lawyers and judges.          By deploying AI, law firms and courts will be able to work more efficiently and automate repetitive tasks. Let's hope this will reduce the notorious backlog of cases in courts today. AI-powered systems are already being used by lawyers, for example to analyze large amounts of data and contracts. And some courts in the United States are using AI systems to assist with sentencing decisions or predict an offender's risk of recidivism.However, there are pitfalls: today's AI algorithms are often not transparent enough to meet the high demands for accountability in the justice system. Critics also fear that AI systems could perpetuate bias and discrimination. This is because the reliability of AI depends on the quality of the data input. If AI support systems are trained on biased data, this can lead to unfair outcomes.To minimize such unintended consequences, it is imperative to rigorously test AI systems before deploying them. New regulatory guidelines are also needed. The EU rightly classifies the use of AI in the justice system as a high-risk application and will regulate it strictly\u2014in terms of transparency, oversight and cybersecurity, among other things\u2014in the AI Act currently under discussion.For me, the justice system belongs to the sensitive and critical areas of our lives where AI systems must not replace humans altogether. To guarantee accountability, we need to keep humans in the loop; I'm convinced that humans are needed as guardians of AI. Judges in the future will not only have to pass judgements, but also decide how AI is used in their work. They will have to know the advantages and disadvantages of AI and keep an eye on the associated trade-offs and balance these in conscious decisions.One such trade-off, for example, is that between speed and thoroughness. AI is undoubtedly fast, and some lawyers argue that \"justice delayed is justice denied.\" An imperfect decision rendered today may therefore be better than a perfect decision not rendered at all.Another trade-off is that between expediency and certainty. Today, there are still no standards governing the use of AI in the judiciary and its validity and reliability. Judges must use their judgment when they allow AI to support them in their work.Often commercially developedA third dilemma arises from the fact that today AI is often developed commercially rather than as an open-source technology. I think developing companies have a legitimate interest in protecting their trade secrets, but this clashes with our insistence that legal decisions be transparent and accountable. If we want to provide the justice system with AI probabilistic analyses of DNA matches and decision-making aids in sentencing, that means compromising on transparency in many cases.AI has the potential to make the justice system more efficient, faster and qualitatively better, but it entails balancing trade-offs and making compromises. As in the case of judges, the use of AI technologies in many other aspects of our lives entails an urgent need to equip the \"humans in the loop\" with a high degree of AI-specific expertise and the self-confidence to make these difficult decisions. As a society, now is the time to collectively define what these trade-offs should be, and to build this capacity.

  "text": "Scientists at Flinders University have used sub-surface imaging and aerial surveys to see through floodplains in the Red Lily Lagoon area of West Arnhem Land in Northern Australia.          These ground-breaking methods showed how this important landscape in the Northern Territory was altered as sea levels rose about 8,000 years ago.Their discovery shows that the ocean had reached this, now inland region, which has important implications for understanding the archaeological record of Madjedbebe\u2014the oldest archaeological site in Australia.The findings also provide a new way to understand the rock art in the region, which is recognised globally for its significance and distinctive style.By examining how sediments now buried beneath the flood plains changed as sea levels rose, the researchers can see how the transformation of Red Lily Lagoon had resulted in the growth of mangroves that have supported animal and marine life in a region where ancient Indigenous rock art is located. This transformation has, in turn, fostered an environment that has inspired the subjects and animals in the ancient rock art.In their findings published in in the scientific journal PLOS ONE today, the researchers say environmental changes at the lagoon are reflected in the rock art because fish, crocodiles and birds were featured in the art when the floodplain transformed to support freshwater habitats for new species.Senior Author and Research Associate in the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences at Flinders University, Dr. Jarrad Knowlessar, says the mapping fundamentally changes our archaeological understanding of the stunning landscape in Arnhem Land.\"This is a key landscape for understanding the early human occupation of Australia. Our reconstruction of Red Lily Lagoon enables effective predictive modelling of prominent cultural sites and provides an important method to interpret the presence and provenance of Indigenous cultural material.\"\"The timing of rock art aligns with the broader environmental changes we understand took place in this landscape. This is evident through changes in subject matter in the art, such as large macropods, and the appearance of estuarine animal species such as fish and crocodiles in the art. The inclusion of freshwater species, such as fish and birds, occurs in the most recent artistic styles of this region, and this reflects the phases of environmental change when the freshwater floodplains made up the landscape.\"      \"Based on the results of this study, all Pleistocene sites in western Arnhem Land were near the ocean and, subsequently, mangrove swamps at some point during the transformation of the landscape. This has important implications for the paleogeographic settings of these sites, which must be considered when interpreting changes in stone artefacts, food resources, and the isotope composition of materials from this period of the first Australians.\"Co-author, Associate Professor Ian Moffat, says Electric Resistivity Tomography (ERT) is a rapid, low-cost, non-invasive method that can map large areas of the Australian landscape to better understand their ancient history.\"We are showcasing how ERT data can be used to develop landscape models that are useful when it comes to understanding known locations as well as predicting where buried archaeological sites might be. We have demonstrated that the landscapes of this region can be effectively mapped using non-invasive methods. This has important implications for locating new sites but also for developing a more nuanced understanding of the regional geography, and its impact on past human behaviour.\"                    Red Lily Lagoon Modern Day Visualisation 2.

  "text": "Job seekers looking to land a role with an altruistic organization may feel too guilty to ask for higher pay, according to a new study from the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin.          Both for-profit and nonprofit organizations increasingly employ what has been termed \"social impact framing\" that emphasizes that their work has welfare benefits for society.Although companies might have entirely noble intentions when using social impact framing, a recent study by Texas McCombs Assistant Professor of Management Insiya Hussain illustrates how it may work against prospective employees during salary negotiations. Specifically, job candidates exposed to such messaging feel it would be against company norms to ask for higher pay.\"This speaks to a broader social phenomenon about how we view money when it comes to doing good,\" Hussain said. \"There's an implicit assumption that money and altruism don't mix. Money taints attempts to do good. Even if job candidates might not necessarily subscribe to this view, they're assuming that hiring managers will.\"The research is online in advance in Organization Science.Hussain and co-authors Marko Pitesa and Michael Schaerer of Singapore Management University and Stefan Thau of INSEAD found that job candidates who were exposed to social impact framing refrained from negotiating for higher salaries because they felt uncomfortable with that \"ask.\"They were concerned that asking for a greater material reward when an organization emphasized altruistic goals would be seen as inappropriate by those with hiring power, and they might thus be viewed unfavorably.The researchers describe this attitude as a \"self-censoring\" effect, which Hussain said is a novel finding for research on social impact framing and wage demands. Prior work assumed that candidates sacrificed pay for meaningful work. Hussain and colleagues show this effect may be driven by job candidates feeling uncomfortable with such negotiation.Whether companies are intentionally using social impact framing to suppress pay is unclear. But, regardless, the researchers suggest managers should be aware of what it may be costing the company in terms of human resources. They suggest that if managers are educated about their motivation purity bias, they can better temper their approach to prospective employees who ask about material rewards.They also recommend managers create greater transparency about company norms and values regarding compensation, and that they offer job rewards based on objective criteria instead of salary negotiations.\"Job seekers could consider whether companies that stress social impact take care of their own employees\u2014financially or otherwise,\" Hussain said. \"And companies shouldn't assume that extrinsically motivated workers don't care about the job and aren't willing to work hard to perform well.\" More information:Insiya Hussain et al, Pay Suppression in Social Impact Contexts: How Framing Work Around the Greater Good Inhibits Job Candidate Compensation Demands, Organization Science (2023).

  "text": "Conservative CEOs are four times more likely than their liberal counterparts to acquire international firms rather than forge new alliances when entering foreign markets, according to new research. The same study finds that these political biases can be moderated by active, independent boards.          Published in the Journal of International Business Studies, the findings come from a sample of more than 1,000 foreign market actions taken by hundreds of S&P 500 CEOs over the last decade. Aaron Hill, a professor in the Warrington College of Business at the University of Florida, conducted the study with colleagues from the University of North Texas, Western Kentucky University and Texas State University.\"In the past, the expectation has been that conservative people tend to be conservative with their money, they tend to shun risk, whereas liberal people tend to be less risk averse,\" Hill said. \"What we found is that in the context of international expansion, our expectation of risk aversion essentially reverses. We find that more conservative CEOs are associated with more risk-seeking strategies, such as acquisitions.\"When entering new markets, acquisitions are riskier than alliances, but they come with more control. Based on other research on political ideology, Hill's group believes that it is the additional control that attracts conservative CEOs to acquisitions and that compensates for the risk inherent in purchasing an international firm. On the flipside, liberal executives seem to prioritize being open to new influences, including in business alliances, a trait associated with liberalism.Hill and his team identified the political leanings of recently hired CEOs by looking at public data on individual political donations in the years before they were named chief executives. Those who donated to the Democratic or Republican parties were considered liberal or conservative, respectively. The more consistently they donated, the stronger the researchers ranked their political ideology. Roughly a third of the CEOs had donated no money to the parties and were assumed to be politically moderate.The researchers then analyzed how these ideological leanings affected the international moves taken by these firms from 2010 to 2018. The final data included 193 CEOs of 176 firms in the S&P 500. The more conservative a CEO, the more likely they were to choose acquisitions over alliances.Businesses and shareholders who want to steer these decisions away from political biases and toward more rational decision making can turn to board oversight, Hill's group discovered.\"Generally speaking, the characteristics associated with sound board structure\u2014independent directors, sound vigilance\u2014weaken this political ideology effect,\" Hill said. \"The board structure is really important. We need board members that are not asleep at the wheel.\"The findings don't just give guidance to businesses. They also contribute to the evolving study of how our political leanings influence our thinking and behaviors in other aspects of our lives.\"I think there are two takeaways,\" Hill said. \"One is we should have a less narrow view about political ideology. Don't just assume that liberal- or conservative-leaning people are always going to act in a certain way. There are a lot of contextual nuances.\"\"Second, there are structures we can put in place in business to guard against these political tendencies,\" he said. More information:Jeffrey A.

  "text": "Academics at Cardiff University and UCL have sought to gain a greater understanding of young people's experiences of learning about relationships, sex, and sexuality.          The research, commissioned by and carried out in collaboration with the NSPCC, used creative and participatory methods, allowing researchers to listen carefully to the views and experiences of young people aged 11\u201418 years from across England, Wales and Scotland, about how and where they learn about relationships, sex and sexuality, what they would like to learn more about, and how they seek support and advice.A central part of the project included working with a young person's advisory group (YPAG) who helped shape the research methods, contribute to the process of analysis and co-construct the creative outputs, including making eight data-poems created from young people's quotes for each key messages of the report.The team found that young people referenced a range of spaces where they learn about the topic, including with friends, family, social media, popular culture and school.Although some young people describe their learning about relationships, sex and sexuality education (RSE) at school as limited, awkward, ineffective and irrelevant to their everyday lives, many said that they still want to learn about relationships, sex and sexuality in school. They want to be able to discuss and ask questions about what they are learning in safe and supportive learning environments and want those who provide RSE to be supported and resourced to make this happen.One participant, Hattie (pseudonym), said, \"The way they taught us about contraception, because it was part of the curriculum, it seemed very scientific and very impersonal, kind of far away because we were learning about it, not for us (\u2026) you should be talking to us (now), not about our future selves.\" (age 17)Ryan, (pseudonym), said, \"I like my tutor, but he's a math teacher, so he's not really a specialist in everything. He's nice, but I want him to know what he's on about and feel comfortable about what he's saying.\"Researcher: \"And do you have a sense of how that might happen?\"Ryan: \"Just training on that.\" (age 14)Credit: Cardiff UniversityWhen asked about what changes they want to see, young people said they would like:Adults to educate themselves about young people's lives and experiences.Parents, trusted adults, educators, and peers to show care and compassion for their diverse experiences, be more open-minded, stand up for equity and challenge discrimination.Teachers to be provided with resources and support to help them feel more comfortable and confident in what and how they educate.The curriculum to be more comprehensive and more closely connected to their own lives and the real-world experiences of others.To be consulted on how they would like to learn and access support in these areas, such as what they think makes a safe, supportive and inclusive learning environment.Project lead, Professor EJ Renold, based at Cardiff University's School of Social Sciences, said, \"Listening to young people matters. This research used creative methods to facilitate inclusive and safe environments for listening to young people. By listening to young people, we are educating ourselves on what and how they are learning about relationships, sex and sexuality. In fact, how we listen to and consult with young people in this area became a key research finding for those working with young people. It also informed how we structured our research report and co-produced our creative outputs with the young people's advisory group.\"\"All our outputs prioritize and amplify youth voice, including the recommendations for change. We hope that they will guide those with decision-making powers so that any current and future policies, resources, and practices in this area are informed by what and how young people are already learning and want to learn.\"Dr. Sara Bragg from UCL said, \"Now is a crucial time to take seriously young people's rights to be consulted on how RSE is provided. Too often what is considered age-appropriate or timely is disconnected from young people's own perspectives and experiences. Our research is grounded in young people's everyday lives and shows how they navigate and negotiate learning about relationships, sex and sexuality across diverse contexts, institutional spaces, practices and situations. We hope our research findings will contribute to more meaningful and informed conversations with young people about what matters to them in learning about relationships, sex and sexuality.\"Maria Neophytou, NSPCC Director of Strategy and Knowledge said, \"High quality relationships and sex education is absolutely vital in ensuring young people understand healthy relationships, are able to recognize abusive behavior and know how to seek help. It reinforces that young people have a right to be safe, heard and respected.\"\"It's essential that young people are part of the conversation about how relationships and sex education is provided.

  "text": "It is well understood that in the labor market there exist wage gaps between men and women, and in general, women have had to fight to break the \"glass ceiling\" to get to upper management in the workplace. The causes of the gender gap may be multiple factors from discrimination to ability difference, and it is not easy to separate one from the other.          These questions were on the mind of researchers when they decided to use video game platforms to get some answers. They chose the online video gaming environment to do their research for its two-dimensional aspect. When creating a character or avatar, one can use their birth sex, or could conceal their gender and portray themselves virtually as the opposite sex.The study authors conducted extensive empirical research to arrive at their findings. In the end, they found that men are more or less motivated by the knowledge of the gender of their competition, whereas women are not. Further, they found that this leads to poorer performance for women when competing against men unless they conceal their gender.The study, \"Does Concealing Gender Identity Help Women Win the Competition? An Empirical Investigation into Online Video Games,\" is published in Marketing Science and authored by Xinlei (Jack) Chen of the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance; Xiaohua Zeng of Peking University HSBC Business School; and Cheng Zhang of the Fudan School of Management in Shanghai.\"Given the competitive nature of video games, we wanted to explore the similarities and differences between the aggressiveness of men versus women,\" says Chen. \"Common stereotypes assume that men tend to be more aggressive, while women are more passive, and that in a competitive environment, men would strive more for dominance while women would not. This is the 'dominance effect.'\"\"Through our research, we found that women did perform better when they actively concealed their gender identities in online video games,\" says Chen. \"To understand these findings, you have to know that online video games can be a toxic environment for women. According to a Pew Research Center survey on online harassment in 2014, compared with male players, female players experience more severe harassment, such as stalking, sexual harassment and sustained bullying.\"The researchers said that this has caused women to quit playing online video games. For those who stayed, by muting their voices and concealing their identity, they were able to play under ambiguous or male names, and ultimately perform on a par with or better than their male counterparts.\"To analyze competitive performance, we had to examine the dominance effect among players of online video games,\" says Chen. \"When men perceive their opponent as female, they tend to exert increased effort in competition, while women seem unaffected by their opponent's gender.\"In the end, the researchers confirmed that gender stereotype arises during interpersonal competition and does affect the outcome of the competition.\"It's important to note that the reason for this is not that women are submissive, but rather, when men perceive their opponent to be female, they are more likely to exert increased effort than they would if they perceive their competitor to be a man,\" adds Chen. \"Women don't change their approach regardless. So, by concealing their gender, they gain an advantage simply by the neutralizing effect such knowledge has on their opponent.\" More information:Xinlei (Jack) Chen et al, Does Concealing Gender Identity Help Women Win the Competition?

  "answer_squad": " E. coli",
  "text": "Genome editing is used to modify the genes of living organisms to elicit certain traits, such as climate-resilient crops or treating human disease at the genetic level. It has become increasingly popular in agriculture, medicine and basic science research over the past decade, and will continue to be relevant and utilized well into the future. Given this prevalence, researchers at the University of California San Diego have started an outreach program that introduces genome-editing technologies to high school students.          Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry Alexis Komor, and Ph.D. candidates Mallory Evanoff and Carlos Vasquez, designed the Genome Editing Technologies Program as a way to educate students on base-editing technologies, expose them to scientists from diverse backgrounds and invite questions about college, professional development, and the everyday life of a graduate student or faculty member within academia. The program is detailed in The CRISPR Journal.Base editors enable scientists to introduce point mutations at targeted sites in the genome of living cells with high efficiency and precision and, thus, have the therapeutic potential to treat thousands of human genetic disorders. Proof-of-concept studies have already demonstrated this technology's potential in cell therapies and in treating progeria, sickle cell disease and liver diseases.\"As we were testing out some of these tools, we asked ourselves, how do we make base editors accessible to high schoolers? How do we make this process really visible?\" said Evanoff.Komor's team generated a base-editing reporter system using E. coli bacteria. In this system, base-editing activity results in the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP). The team installed a mutation in the bacterium's GFP gene to remove its fluorescence. To emphasize the connection to genetic diseases, this phenotype is called \"GFP-itis,\" and students are tasked with \"curing\" the bacteria. Using base-editing technology, students correct the mutation back to wild-type, resulting in bacterial cells that fluoresce green.The program happens over three days, creating a more meaningful partnership with the school and building a better foundation of trust with the students. \"We wanted the students to get to know us better and feel comfortable asking questions about a career in STEM,\" said Komor. \"A popular question is simply, 'How do I get into undergraduate research?' One of the students in the first school we visited, Sage Creek High School, is actually an undergraduate researcher in our lab now.\"      That student is Preety Iyer, a first-year human biology major, who recalled Komor's visit to her high school as \"an amazing opportunity to get hands-on experience with gene-editing technology. It seemed like an intangible concept to me when I was learning about it in my biology classes. Being walked through the entire process and being able to do it myself strengthened my understanding of DNA and gene editing.\"Iyer plans to become a doctor working with patients who have rare genetic disorders, and she's excited to gain more valuable hands-on experience in Komor's lab: \"I've been able to use equipment and practice techniques, like flow cytometry and plasmid preparation, that other students don't get to use until later in their academic careers.\"So far, the Genome Editing Technologies Program has visited three local high schools. The schools have had well-developed science classes and much of the equipment needed to run the experiment. The majority of students had also heard of or learned about genome engineering before. Now that Komor's team has run the program a few times and solicited feedback from students, they hope to expand to schools without such robust science programming.\"My high school background in science wasn't strong in large part because of the lack of mentorship,\" said Vasquez. \"It's important to us to reach students who may not have even considered a career in STEM or medicine. To look in their eyes and instill confidence, to show we believe in them\u2014having someone like that when I was in high school would have made a world of difference.\"To make the experiment as accessible as possible, the team has simplified the base-editing experiment and provides all the necessary equipment. Accessibility also means making the program available to other institutions that may want to implement something similar. Interested scientists or instructors can order plasmid materials from AddGene, a worldwide nonprofit plasmid repository. These plasmids are the DNA needed to make the GFP-itis cells, as well the plasmids needed to as \"cure\" GFP-itis.The goal of the program is not only to make base editing accessible to high school students, but also to encourage critical thinking and reflect on base editing in social and cultural contexts. Komor's team asked students to think about the difference between a disease and a trait and to consider the implications of germline genome editing, in which edits are inherited by all future descendants of the edited individual, regardless of whether those descendants consent to the procedure.\"The ethical discussion is what hits a home run with the students,\" said Vasquez. \"They'll be responsible for future gene-editing policies. It's interesting to see them thinking about the ethical side of science.\"\"We've had some really good discussions about what is a disease and what is a trait,\" stated Evanoff. \"If we have the ability to make genetic-disease corrections, who will be able to afford those treatments? Where does the equitability lie in this technology? We don't have the answers to that. I say to students, 'That's going to be your job to figure out!'\" More information:Carlos A.

  "text": "The hospitality sector was undoubtedly hugely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, but new research has now shown the knock-on effect that had on other sections of the economy.          The new study from the University of Aberdeen Rowett Institute and Scotland's Rural College (SRUC) found that the resilience of the food and drink sector is largely influenced not only by related sectors (food services and accommodation) but also by non-food sectors of the industry.Published last month (April) in Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems, the research highlighted the knock-on effect the COVID-19 pandemic had on other connected sectors of the economy.The accommodation and food service sector\u2014or hospitality sector\u2014provides approximately 5 billion pounds in gross value added to the Scottish economy. In addition, it is the largest employing sector of the economy employing approximately 200,000 jobs before the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on both employment/jobs and total output from the sector; a loss of 85% of output between February and May 2020, and a 23% loss in the number of jobs between March and December 2020.Sectors which were particularly impacted because of the accommodation and food services sector suffering during the pandemic, included the processed fish, fruits, vegetables, dairy, vegetable oils and soft drinks industry.Professor Cesar Revoredo-Giha from SRUC and Dr. Wisdom Dogbe from the Rowett Institute carried out the analysis as part of the Scottish Government Strategic Research Program.Dr. Dogbe said, \"In order to carry out our research, we applied a novel methodology 'Dynamic Inoperability Input-output model' to Scottish input-output tables from 1998 to 2019 to identify connected economic sectors that are most affected by the disruption to the accommodation and food services sector and how long it will take for the interconnected sectors to recover from shock future shocks. This was combined also with information related to sectoral quarterly gross value added (GVA) up to 2021, which measures the evolution of the production in each sector.\"Focusing on the food and beverage sectors, our analysis found that the processed and preserved fish, fruits, and vegetable sector is the slowest to return to its initial production level following the disruption on the accommodation and food services sector, indicating that this sector needs to develop stronger capabilities to deal with future disruptions. We attribute the slow recovery of this sector to the demand shift towards fresh products and influx of media reportage on the importance of fresh fruit and vegetables to build immunity against the COVID-19 infection. The most resilient sector (fastest to recover) is the preserved meat and meat product. This could be due to demand shift from the closure of the hospitality sector towards household demand.\"Professor Revoredo-Ghia added, \"This study shows that different sections of the economy do not operate in isolation, and that their outputs can be hugely impacted by disruptions to related sectors.\"Stakeholders in the accommodation and food services sector should re-examine the sector and develop strong capabilities against future pandemics. In addition, since the disruption to one sector affects the other, we recommend that sectors work closely together by sharing the risk or cost of future pandemics.\"Future research into this area will narrow the analysis down to specific food supply chains such as the pig to pork, cattle to beef, potato products among others.

The study argues that this framing was rooted in sexist beliefs that associate femininity in politics with weakness.Dr. Nathalie Weidhase, author of the study and Lecturer in Media Communication at the University of Surrey said, \"We found language that strongly suggested that the 'feminine weakness' is the opposite of the 'masculine strength' that is deemed necessary to 'get Brexit done.\" Thus, Brexit has been constructed as inherently masculine, and women are considered a threat to this project, highlighting Brexit as a gendered political process.\"\"Unfortunately, in the eyes of the media, female qualities, and women themselves, can only stand in the way of the success of Brexit as an inherently male political populist project.\"As an example of the sexism female politicians are subjected to, the study shows how newspapers highlighted May's tears as an extraordinary act for a politician, but also as proof that Theresa May did possess some feminine emotions. This unexpected display of emotions was met with sympathy across the political spectrum. However, it also revealed a range of tensions throughout the British media landscape along political and gendered lines.The study is published in the journal Feminist Media Studies.Dr. Weidhase commented further: \"Emotional performances come at a cost for women. They may make female political leaders more likable, but in turn they lose credibility and are judged as less competent\u2014trapping them in a double bind that suggests that the assertiveness required for leadership is incompatible with the qualities associated with femininity, such as empathy.\"\"Female politicians are mediated as women first, politicians second, but are simultaneously meant to represent other women politically\u2014an additional burden in itself. In the context of social media, this intensifies in violent ways with female politicians being regularly subjected to torrents of sexist abuse.\" More information:Nathalie Weidhase, Theresa's tears: gendering mediations of populist leadership failures in Brexit Britain, Feminist Media Studies (2023).

  "text": "A massive, Stanford-led study has found that a brief exercise addressing common concerns about belonging in college increased first-year completion rates on students' local campus, especially for students in racial-ethnic and social-class groups that were less likely historically to complete the first year at that school.          In the new paper published in Science, Stanford psychologist Gregory Walton\u2014joined by 36 collaborators from 24 other institutions\u2014sheds light on the relationship between the psychological mindsets students use to navigate college and the opportunities students have in higher education settings.\"If colleges don't offer students adequate opportunities to belong, then just working with students psychologically won't move the needle\u2014and we need to create better settings,\" said Walton, a professor of psychology in the School of Humanities and Sciences. \"At the same time, many students have reasonable concerns about whether 'people like me' can belong in my college but do have opportunities. That's where the intervention helps.\"Acknowledging uncertainties about social belongingComing to college is hard. Many students feel homesick at one time or another, or struggle sometimes to make friends, to find an academic direction, or to talk with professors. Some students, particularly those from groups that have historically been excluded in higher education, may see these experiences as confirming that \"people like me\" don't belong. As Walton's previous research has found, this uncertainty about belonging can undermine academic performance and achievement, which left unaddressed can perpetuate inequalities into adult life.For over two decades, Walton has developed a range of interventions to help students surface and address belonging worries. This project was conducted by the College Transition Collaborative (CTC), a group founded in 2014 at Stanford by Walton together with former Stanford post-doctoral scholar Christine Logel (now at the University of Waterloo), and former Stanford graduate students Mary Murphy (Indiana University) and David Yeager (University of Texas at Austin). CTC recently spun out of Stanford and became the Equity Accelerator, led by Murphy.Here, the social-belonging intervention is put to its largest test. With some 22 colleges and universities across the country and a diverse sample of 26,911 students participating, Walton and his collaborators were able to examine the conditions that made the intervention more or less effective.The researchers took a unique approach in their analyses. Rather than compare students by single, broad categories\u2014such as Black or first-generation college students\u2014the scholars broke the sample into what they called \"local-identity groups\"\u2014students of a given race-ethnicity, with a given first-generation status, at a given college, in a given cohort. That allowed them to study the nuances of identity and belonging in different college settings.\"Past research has focused on canonical groups, like African American students or first-generation college students,\" said Walton. \"It's as if being, say, African American is the same thing everywhere. But we know that's not true. One of the innovations here is to understand that any given group has different vulnerabilities and different opportunities in different settings. We map that.\"      Offering students adaptive ideas about belonging at collegeThe intervention was administered online to students before matriculation.First, students saw results of a survey of older students about how worries about belonging were normal and improved over time. Then, they read personal narratives from diverse students about their worries about belonging and what helped lessen them.For example, one narrative read: \"I found a comfort zone by exploring my interests and taking the leap into an active life on campus. But this took time and before I found my niche here there were times when I felt quite lonely.\"Last, students were asked to reflect on these stories and write an essay for future students about belonging concerns, and how they are normal and improve with time.\"What we're doing here is offering students the idea that it's normal to worry at first about whether you belong, and it can get better with time,\" said Walton. \"Then students can try out that idea in their world and see if it holds and if they can use it to grow their belonging.\"Overall, the scholars found that when the intervention was administered in a supportive environment, first-year full-time completion rates for students in groups that had been persisting at lower rates rose by two percentage points, an impressive impact for an online exercise that took less than 30 minutes to complete (the average time students spent on a key aspect of the exercise\u2014sharing their story\u2014was just 7\u00bd minutes).The intervention is not enough on its ownWalton uses a \"seed and soil\" metaphor to understand the relationship between psychological messages and school contexts.In this analogy, sharing a hopeful way to think about belonging (planting a \"high-quality seed\") will make a difference only in contexts in which that way of thinking is true and useful (in \"fertile soil\").But if the soil is inhospitable for a given group\u2014for example, if racial, gender, or social class biases or other barriers make it prohibitive for students to build friendships, find mentors, develop an academic direction, or see their group valued and respected on campus\u2014the seed will wither. Students will drop the idea, and it won't help them succeed.The findings generalize to 749 four-year institutions in the United States, which together welcome over a million new students to college each year. If every institution offered incoming students the belonging exercise, an estimated 12,136 students would complete the first year of college full time each year. And the results point to the possibility of larger gains if colleges expand opportunities for belonging.\"What's key is for institutions to look at the student groups they are trying to serve, and ask how well they're doing with the expectation that they will be doing well with some groups but not as well with others,\" said Walton. \"How can you expand opportunities for belonging for all groups? And how can you convey the truth of the belonging message in compelling and authentic ways for everyone?\"The belonging module is freely available to all colleges and universities in the United States and Canada at perts.net/orientation/cb.

  "text": "Music is an integral part of our daily lives, but what makes a song successful in the competitive music market remains a mystery to even the most experienced experts. A new study, led by researchers at the University of Oxford, suggests that environmental factors such as weather conditions and seasonal patterns can play a significant role in shaping listener preferences and choices, potentially impacting a song's success in the market.          The research, which analyzed over 23,000 songs that reached the UK weekly top charts in the last 70 years, found that songs that were energetic, danceable, and evoked positive emotions such as joy and happiness were positively associated with warm and sunny weather and negatively associated with rainy and cold months. Similarly, energetic and positive music varied according to expected seasonal patterns in the UK, increasing in summer and decreasing in winter.However, the study also found that these results depended on the popularity of the music: While hyper popular songs in the top 10 of the charts exhibited the strongest associations with weather fluctuations, less popular songs showed no relationship at all. This suggests that a song's fit with prevailing weather may be a factor pushing a song into the top of the charts.Lead researcher Dr. Manuel Anglada-Tort (Faculty of Music, University of Oxford), said, \"These findings challenge the traditional notion that success in the music market is solely based on the quality of the music itself. Instead, our study suggests that favorable environmental conditions, such as warm and sunny weather, induce positive emotional states in listeners, which in turn, leads them to choose to listen to energetic and positive music, potentially to match their current mood.\"Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering broad environmental factors when analyzing the success of songs in the music market, and provides insight into how music choices are influenced by external factors beyond the music itself.Nevertheless, Dr. Anglada-Tort added: \"this is a correlational study so the results must be interpreted with caution. Correlation is not causation. Although we perform control analyses to account for temporal and seasonal dynamics, but we cannot establish any causal effect between weather and music preferences.\"To study this large dataset, the research used machine learning techniques to extract music features from the audio of all songs. They found that audio features varied along two musical dimensions. The first musical dimension corresponded to audio features reflecting high intensity and positive emotions, such as happiness and joy.  For example, Temperature by Sean Paul (2005). The second dimension corresponded to audio features reflecting low intensity and negative emotions, such as sadness. For example, Never Gonna Fall in Love Again by Dana (1976).Interestingly, not all combinations of music features were related to weather conditions. The researchers found that only music features reflecting high intensity and positive emotions were associated with weather conditions, whereas music features reflecting low intensity and negative emotions were not related to weather at all. This suggests that negative emotional states may be more influenced by individual situational factors rather than general environmental conditions.The study is published in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

  "answer_squad": " The Fourier transform",
  "text": "Imagine being able to predict how a group of people will behave before they even know it themselves. From the dynamics of a sports team to the complexities of a nation, the ability to anticipate human interactions has long been a goal of scientists and analysts. Now, a team of researchers at Sandia National Laboratories is pioneering a new approach to social analysis.          Sandia cybersecurity expert Mike Brzustowicz believes a well-known mathematical function may provide the key to predicting that level of social interaction.\"The Fourier transform is a mathematical principle that very simply tells you the frequency\u2014the count\u2014of things that you're observing. A famous use of the principle is transforming sound waves and time into frequency,\" Brzustowicz explained. \"We are working with the non-Abelian Fourier transform. This is a totally different thing. It tells you about combinations of entities. So instead of understanding what individual things are happening, it tells you what connections exist between groups of things.\"The work builds upon what was started with one of Brzustowicz's collaborators, David Uminsky. Uminsky began the work at the University of San Francisco when trying to analyze genetic sequences and identify mutations. Eventually Uminsky and his team reached a point where they lacked the computing power to analyze large number sets and needed the computational capability that Sandia can offer.\"When you talk about a combination of things, there are almost infinitely many combinations of very small groups,\" Brzustowicz explained. \"The basketball team idea is something my collaborator David Uminsky published a long time ago: There are 15 players on the bench and there are five on the floor at a time. And then with those five on the floor, you look at thousands of combinations of the different players.\"But that is a small system to look at when compared to a community, a state or a nation, or groups of people that are not even geographically related.\"Ten years ago, it took forever to process that on a computer, and now it takes me like a second. But when you think of a social network, you may be thinking of hundreds or thousands of people,\" Brzustowicz said. \"If you have 20 people together or 30 people, there are so many possible group combinations. You couldn't maybe write them all down because you wouldn't have enough memory on your computer, or you wouldn't be able to annotate them. If we wanted to look at social networks and understand how subgroups interact with social networks, we're barely getting there. So that's our challenge.\"Now Brzustowicz and his team are trying to figure out how big a transform they can compute, and what kinds of groups they can predict.\"We're already doing stuff that's really cool,\" Brzustowicz said. \"It's enviable that we can get to this level, but if we can go further, you know, like no one's doing this, the non-Abelian Fourier transform.\"He added that Sandia is ideally positioned to figure out where the math goes next.\"I think that's what the national labs are good at,\" Brzustowicz concluded. \"We're not academics, we're not industry. We're not bound by those two extremes, bounded by 'what can you do that will get published' and bound by, 'does this make the submit button at Google work better, or make the timeline at Facebook more appealing?' We're in the middle where we solve practical problems, but we have these huge resources available to us.\" Provided bySandia National LaboratoriesCitation:Using math to map social connections (2023, May 4)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-math-social.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "The Netherlands, late 1944. After the liberation from the Nazis, there were still unexpected problems to solve. Trains and river transport were blocked by rivers that had frozen over so people found it more difficult to access food.          This critical situation led to a great famine, especially in the country's western urban areas. Calorie consumption went from 1,800 to 500 kilocalories per person per day from May 1944 to February 1945.It is estimated that from the fall of 1944 until May 1945, between 20,000 and 25,000 Dutch citizens died of malnutrition. This also affected pregnant women and babies less than one year old, with long-term consequences on the health of these children.A 16-year-old apprentice ballerina, who was 1.70 meters tall and weighed 40.8 kilos, would later recall that she suffered from asthma, jaundice, anemia and other diseases that result from malnutrition, such as edema. \"It starts with your feet and when it reaches your heart, you die. For me, it was above my ankles when the Allied Forces liberated us\".She and her family survived\u2014by eating tulips.Tulip soup to soothe the soulThe Dutch government was looking for food that was rich in energy and nutrients, as well as easily accessible. During this stage of war, tulips were no longer cultivated and a large reserve of unplanted bulbs remained. Therefore, authorities took advantage of this surplus to sell bulbs in grocery stores and publish recipes in local magazines in an effort to help the population. Tulip bulb soup was cooked during the only hour of gas that was available per day.One of these recipes was prepared in the following way: \"Add water to the pot, cut the bulbs in half and remove the germ. Next, grate the bulbs with a fine grater and preferably into the pot since the pulp discolors quickly. Although tulip bulbs are rich in starch, they will not thicken the soup as flour does. Their pulp floats in the soup like flakes. If you have curry powder at home, add a pinch, then add a little oil or a small amount of fat. And don't forget the salt!\".      Toxic bulbsTulips, nevertheless, have a problem. Their bulbs mainly contain an allergen: the compound called tulipalin A, which is primarily found in the bulb's outer layer, but also in the stem, leaves and petals.Experts have detected the poisoning of cows which have eaten hay and tulip bulbs, in addition to the compound's role as a causative agent of so-called \"tulip fingers\". This dermatitis, which affects bulbiculturists, is characterized by a red rash on the skin located around the nails and between the tips of the dominant hand's first and second fingers. It can only be prevented by limiting contact with these bulbous plants and using nitrile gloves (vinyl gloves do not work).The danger of consuming tulip bulbs lies in the variety or in the way in which they are prepared. In fact, not all types are edible, and those that are have a bitter taste. On the other hand, eating them uncooked can cause nausea, stomachaches and other digestive problems.In modern cuisineToday, tulip bulbs can be dried, pulverized and added to grains or modified to obtain flour to make bread.In addition, the flowers are also edible. They can be used to decorate dishes, with the whole flower (without the pistil and stamens) or by chopping the petals and mixing them into a salad, although they do not have much flavor. The ornamental use of sugared petals on a cake or eating them with syrup is also noteworthy.Efforts to recover this original ingredient are seen in current gastronomy. Margaret Roberts, an expert in nutritional plants and medicine, has gathered recipes such as tulip syrup, tulips stuffed with chicken mayonnaise and three bean salad with tulips.Other examples to highlight are Johanna Huiberts-van den Berg, who collected some thirty recipes; and Alain Caron, a French chef based in the Netherlands for the past 40 years and who runs several restaurants in Amsterdam. Caron invented dishes such as tomato confit, fennel and tulip bulb salad and oysters with tulip bulbs.What might that young woman who discussed the ravages of the Dutch famine have made of the culinary evolution of the tulip? Years after the hunger she became one of the twentieth century's best known actresses, and at the end of April 1990 she was declared a star of the botanical world in the Netherlands. The Dutch bulb industry paid tribute to her by naming a white variety of the flower with exceptional luminosity, the Audrey Hepburn tulip.

  "text": "Evidence from West Africa about human evolution remains scarce, but recent research has indicated unique patterns of cultural change in comparison to other regions of the continent. A new article in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution adds to our understanding with a study of the oldest directly dated archaeological site in West Africa. The site shows technological continuity spanning roughly 140,000 years and offers insights into the ecological stability of the region.       Our species emerged in Africa about 300 thousand years ago and until about 30\u201360 thousand years ago typically used tools and tool-making techniques referred to as Middle Stone Age toolkits. Around that time, distinct Later Stone Age toolkits began to emerge in northern, eastern, and southern Africa. While recent evidence suggests Middle Stone Age toolkits persisted in West Africa much later, to around 10,000 years ago, the antiquity of these technologies is poorly understood.The new study, led by scientists from the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology, Universit\u00e9 Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar, University of Sheffield, and University of South Florida, extends the timeframe in which Middle Stone Age toolkits are known from West Africa to 150 thousand years ago, based on excavations from the near-coastal site of Bargny 1.                150-thousand-year-old sediments at Bargny 1 that contain West Africa\u2019s oldest Middle Stone Age toolkits. Credit: Jimbob Blinkhorn             \"The stone tool assemblage dating from 150 thousand years ago shows classic features of the Middle Stone Age, with the use of Levallois and discoidal reduction methods and the use of small retouched flake tools rather than larger implements,\" says Dr. Khady Niang, lead author of the study. \"The assemblage from Bargny 1 is closely comparable to those of a similar age from across the continent, and is the first site from West Africa dating to the Middle Pleistocene, prior to the onset of substantial technological regionalization elsewhere in Africa.\"The site itself is located close to the modern coastline, south of Dakar, Senegal. While no artifacts indicating direct human engagement with coastal resources were recovered at the site, study of the associated environments offer a wider perspective.                Pollen from the Bargny 1 including Avicennia (top) and Typha (bottom), that demonstrate the proximity of the site to estuary environments in the past. Scale is 25 microns. Credit: Chris Kiahtipes             \"We found mangrove and brackish wetland plant microfossils associated with the site's occupation,\" adds Dr. Chris Kiahtipes of the University of South Florida, co-author on the study. \"This is particularly interesting because it shows that the site was located near an estuary and demonstrates how important these habitats are to humans past and present.\"The study highlights long-term durability of core elements of Middle Stone Age toolkits in West Africa without evidence for the appearance of specialized technological developments observed elsewhere.\"Middle Stone Age populations adapted to a wide range of habitats and engaged with climatic changes across Africa. But in West Africa, we see considerable environmental stability over the past 150 thousand years,\" adds Dr. Jimbob Blinkhorn.\"One explanation for the enduring cultural continuity we observe is that it was a stable behavioral adaptation to stable environmental conditions, whilst potential isolation from other populations across Africa may have led to demographic stability too. Ultimately, our study helps illustrate the persistent utility of Middle Stone Age technologies to inhabit the diverse habitats found across Africa.\" More information:Khady Niang, Longstanding behavioural stability in West Africa extends to the Middle Pleistocene at Bargny, coastal Senegal, Nature Ecology & Evolution (2023).

  "text": "The Beatles famously sang, \"Money can't buy me love,\" but married couples who manage their finances together may love each other longer, according to research from the Indiana University Kelley School of Business.          Prior research suggests a correlation that couples who merge finances tend to be happier than those who do not. But this is the first research to show a causal relationship\u2014that married couples who have joint bank accounts not only have better relationships, but they fight less over money and feel better about how household finances are handled.\"When we surveyed people of varying relationship lengths, those who had merged accounts reported higher levels of communality within their marriage compared to people with separate accounts, or even those who partially merged their finances,\" said Jenny Olson, assistant professor of marketing at Kelley. \"They frequently told us they felt more like they were 'in this together.'\"\"This is the best evidence that we have to date for a question that shapes couples' futures; and the fact that we observe these meaningful shifts over two years, I think it's a pretty powerful testament to the benefits of merging. On average, merging should warrant a conversation with your partner, given the effects that we're seeing here.\"The findings appear in the article \"Common Cents: Bank Account Structure and Couples' Relationship Dynamics,\" which will appear in the Journal of Consumer Research.Olson and her co-authors recruited 230 couples, who were either engaged or newly married at the time, and followed them over two years as they began their married lives together. Everyone began the study with separate accounts and consented to potentially changing their financial arrangements. This was the first marriage for everyone involved in the study.Some couples were then randomly assigned to keep their separate bank accounts, and others were told to open a joint bank account instead. A third group was allowed to make the decision on their own.Couples who were told to open joint bank accounts reported substantially higher relationship quality two years later than those who maintained separate accounts, Olson said, adding that merging promotes greater financial goal alignment and transparency, and a communal understanding of marriage.\"A communal relationship is one where partners respond to each other's needs because there's a need. 'I want to help you because you need it. I'm not keeping track,'\" she said. \"There's a 'we' perspective, which we theorized would be related to a joint bank account.\"Olson said that couples with separate accounts viewed financial decision-making as more of an exchange.\"It's 'I help you because you're going to help me later,'\" she said. \"They're prepaying for later favors, and that's tit-for-tat, which we see a bit more with separate accounts. It's 'I've got the Netflix bill and you pay the doctor.' \u2026 They're not working together like those with joint accounts\u2014who have the same pool of money\u2014and that's more common in business-type relationships.\"With separate accounts, those in a marriage potentially may think it is easier to leave the relationship, Olson said. Twenty percent of participating couples did not finish the study, including a significant percentage of those who separated after not merging bank accounts. They found no gender differences in the results.The mean age of participants was 28 years old. Three quarters were white, and 12 percent were Black. Thirty-six percent had a bachelor's degree and a median household income of $50,000. Couples had known each other, on average, about five years and had been romantically involved for an average of three years. Ten percent had children.

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the definition of escapism?",
  "answer_squad": " an intense experience that allows individuals to temporarily leave their daily life behind in a pleasurable way",
  "text": "In an ever-evolving, post-pandemic world, more and more consumers of luxury goods are opting for unplanned, high-end experiences instead, according to researchers at the University of Houston Conrad N. Hilton College of Global Hospitality Leadership.          In a new study published in the Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Research, Minjing Shin, an assistant professor at Hilton College, and her colleagues at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, suggest unplanned purchases of luxury experiences increase positive emotions and a sense of escapism. Hospitality experts define escapism as an intense experience that allows individuals to temporarily leave their daily life behind in a pleasurable way.\"During COVID, people were stuck at home, and we saw a lot of impulse buying of luxury items as a way to cope with that stress,\" Shin said. \"But post-COVID, we've seen more interest in unique experiences, including same-day hotel and flight bookings, by people wanting to escape that mundane daily routine.\"To better understand the difference in the impact of luxury goods versus experiences, Shin and her colleagues surveyed dozens of consumers in the U.S. and Hong Kong on their recent purchases. While impulse purchases of goods such as perfumes and sunglasses provided some elevated sense of self, they found purchases of experiences, such as hotel stays and fine dining, brought higher levels of perceived escapism and positive emotions. And the higher the price, the higher the escapism.\"The perception of escapism is greater the more someone pays for the experience,\" Shin said. \"But exclusivity must be maintained through higher prices or more people are going to buy into it and dilute the escapism of it. If it's not special and unique, then it won't have the same effect.\"Shin adds that while material goods are tangible and physically owned for some time, experiences are intangible and owned as long-lasting memories.\"Because experiences are more personal, more unique to your self-concept, people are relating to them more than ever before,\" Shin said. \"And people who make these unplanned luxury purchases exhibit more positive emotions as they deviate from daily regulations and pressures, if only for a little while.\"The need to 'escape' was a major driver in the travel and tourism industry's post-COVID recovery. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council, in 2021, 75% of hotel stays were booked three days or less in advance, and 48% were same-day bookings. Domestic destinations were first to bounce back, but as borders began to reopen, international spending increased. As that trend towards experiences over goods continues, Shin sees a huge opportunity for marketers of luxury hospitality.\"This doesn't just impact the consumers, it impacts those providing the experiences as well,\" Shin said. \"Marketers may find shifting their focus to these exclusive 'escapes' can increase profits and bring people closer to their brands.\" More information:YooHee Hwang et al, Unplanned Purchases of Luxury Goods and Experiences, Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research (2023).

  "answer_squad": " the National Assembly",
  "text": "Since 2017, political scientist Leila Demarest has immersed herself into the dynamics of Nigeria's National Assembly, the federal parliament of the country. How does this institution work, and how do politicians cooperate? And how are public resources, mainly funded by oil money, distributed among the different regions?          Thanks to several field trips to the capital of Nigeria, adding up to a period of 8 months, she wrote four papers on different aspects of Nigeria's National Assembly. The research is published in Publius: The Journal of Federalism, Nigerian Journal of Legislative Affairs, Democratization and Party Politics. In this article, she highlights the main findings.Tensions between ethnic and regional groupsInitially, Demarest was mainly interested in relations between members of parliament from different ethnic and regional groups. Tensions between these groups are recurrent in Nigeria, with some divisions turning violent. One main issue of contestation is access to public resources. Politicians often criticize national and regional governments, arguing that their regions are marginalized and they are not getting their fair share.In this context, she wondered how the Nigerian parliament ever gets the budget approved and is ever able to agree on resource distribution. This question stemmed from her earlier research on intergroup divisions and federalism in Nigeria.Committees provide access to public resourcesIn 2017, she set out to investigate this and soon discovered that her initial ideas needed adaptation. Demarest: \"For instance, I initially thought political parties would play an important role in getting politicians from different ethnic and regional groups to agree on policies, especially given that parties in Nigeria are by law required to be cross-cutting (there is a ban on ethnic parties). Yet parties appeared to have little practical impact on the work of Members of Parliament (MPs), who rarely received instructions.\" Nevertheless, intergroup relations were quite amicable, and parliament rarely saw gridlock, or severe infighting.What Demarest discovered was that MPs mainly foster cooperation through the parliamentary committee system. The Assembly leadership makes sure that all relevant ethno-regional groups have a key position in parliament and have equal access to committees.These committees in turn provide access to public resources: MPs can lobby for projects in their constituencies and can divert public contracts to their own companies or those of their friends. Given that everyone gets a piece of what in Nigeria is called 'the national cake' (oil money resources), stability is maintained.      Uncovering the power of MPsShe also soon discovered her original research question was also linked to other, equally interesting questions: \"It has been a widespread idea in my field (African politics), that legislatures were not really worthy of in-depth investigation as they were generally perceived to be weak, rubber-stamp institutions.Yet given that MPs in Nigeria could divert public resources to themselves, I discovered this also empowered them vis-\u00e0-vis the president. Especially MPs with access to some of the more \"juicy\" committees like petroleum, education, health etc, were shown to sponsor more legislation, also legislation curtailing the president's power.\"Where are resources directed?Yet while lawmakers have access to public resources, it was also important to check where these resources were directed to. Previous research had mainly argued that lawmakers provide benefits (development projects, cash transfers, etc.) to their constituencies to get votes and remain in power.This was incongruent with realities in Nigeria, where most resources are accrued by elites. According to Demarest, her research argues that \"MPs are not actually incentivized to work for constituents as they primarily need to pay off senior party elites to get positions. Voters are paid to vote around election time, but that is more a one-off exchange.\"On the processDemarest conducted several field visits to Abuja, the capital of Nigeria between 2017 and 2022. Her last research visit had to be postponed due to corona. Luckily the foundation that gave the travel grant was flexible (Catharine van Tussenbroek Fonds).Gathering the information she needed was challenging sometimes, Demarest explains. \"During my field visits, I conducted a survey among Members of Parliament, and numerous interviews with MPs and staff. This was not always easy; MPs tend to be very busy and do not always have time for you. In addition, my focus was on sensitive topics like clientelism and political corruption; people do not talk about these topics freely. For me, it was important to connect with local researchers to learn more about this. I was a visiting fellow at National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS), for instance.\"\"I also relied a lot on official documents of parliamentary proceedings, like the legislative debates, votes and proceedings, and order papers. These documents allowed me to construct my own dataset on MPs, their background characteristics, and which bills and motions they (co-)sponsored. This manual collation was certainly challenging work, but very valuable insights were obtained through this.\"The research has been published across a number of journals over the past few years.

  "text": "As the coronavirus began to spread globally, face masks were recommended in public settings to protect against transmission, and compliance varied significantly. In a new study of people shopping in a large Chinese store in early 2020, researchers examined the motives behind customers' compliance with mask recommendations and how their shopping behaviors changed with the onset of the pandemic. The study found that customers changed their in-store behaviors significantly based on their compliance with masking recommendations.          The study, by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Harvard University, and Renmin University, is published in Marketing Science.\"At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a variety of psychological factors drove individuals' reactions to masking recommendations, making the pandemic a large-scale social experiment,\" says Kannan Srinivasan, Professor of Management, Marketing, and Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, who led the study.Srinivasan and colleagues examined customers at a large store of a retail chain in China, using recordings from high-resolution cameras at entries, checkout counters, and other locations inside the store. Researchers collected videos from January 1-23, 2020 (which they classified as the pre-pandemic period) and from February 1 to May 31, 2020. The World Health Organization issued a statement about the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, and China presented evidence of human-to-human transmission on January 23. The store was closed from January 24-31, 2020.Based on studies on social influence and mask wearing, researchers identified three types of customers: Fully compliant customers (54%) wore masks and seemed motivated primarily by concerns about their own health risk. Partially compliant customers (29%) also wore masks, but wore them improperly, and were motivated by the desire to comply with social norms. Non-compliant customers (17%) did not wear masks and were unmotivated by health concerns or social norms.To infer motives behind wearing masks, the researchers used advanced facial recognition mechanisms to detect whether a customer wore a mask and measured the mask fit (operationalized as the extent of mask coverage) for those who did. Fully compliant customers wore their masks over a larger area above the nose than partially compliant customers.The researchers used the store videos to examine changes in individuals' shopping behaviors at the onset of the pandemic, contrasting them with the individuals' shopping behaviors before the pandemic. In particular, they looked at customers' attempts to practice social distancing and the amount of time spent in the store, as well as at what kinds of masks customers wore.Fully compliant mask wearers remained at a greater distance from cashiers when shopping during the pandemic than they did before the pandemic. They were five times more likely than other mask wearers to wear highly protective N95 masks while shopping and spent 25% less time shopping than they did before the pandemic.In contrast, partially compliant mask wearers did not distance themselves from cashiers, were less likely to wear high-quality masks, and shopped for the same duration of time as they did before the pandemic. Similarly, non-mask wearers did not distance themselves from cashiers and did not change the duration of their shopping time.\"Our findings have implications for businesses, health practitioners, and policymakers,\" suggests Shunyuan Zhang, Assistant Professor of Marketing at Harvard Business School, who coauthored the study.In particular:Retailers can target different customers in different ways: For example, for fully compliant customers, they can explain their efforts to reduce shopping time and mitigate store congestion, and for the partially compliant, they can emphasize the importance of social responsibility.Public-health practitioners can message more effectively when their efforts are customized to appeal to individual motives. For example, practitioners may benefit from applying the same principles to efforts involving vaccine compliance.In regions with large numbers of partially compliant or non-compliant individuals, policymakers can redouble educational efforts to encourage more masking.More information:Shunyuan Zhang et al, Frontiers: Unmasking Social Compliance Behavior During the Pandemic, Marketing Science (2023).

  "text": "Assuming that people with a criminal record are inherently more inclined to break the rules is wrong, according to a paper published in the Journal of Experimental Criminology by Joachim Vosgerau (Bocconi) and Sarah Kuehn (Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania, U.S.). The authors wanted to test both the actual propensity to cheat of former inmates compared with people who had never been charged, and whether the general public has a bias against former convicts.          The authors ran an experiment in the U.S. in the form of a game deliberately designed to allow a margin for cheating, which could result in a financial gain at the expense of a fellow player. This game was played by two otherwise similar groups of participants, one half former prison inmates on parole and the other half people without a criminal record. Cheating at this game, the authors infer, is a proxy for immoral behavior in any context.The experiment showed that neither group was more likely to cheat than the other: participants on parole, that is, played just as honestly as people with no criminal record. After the game ended, the authors set up a survey in which a nationally representative sample of over 2,400 respondents were first instructed on how the game worked, and subsequently asked to predict the prevalence of deceitful behavior for each group of players.Respondents overestimated the extent of deceitful behavior for all participants in the game, but this effect was stronger when predicting how often players on parole had cheated. Respondents who agreed the most with the statement \"Once a criminal, always a criminal,\" included in the survey, were also the ones who gave the highest overestimates of cheating by players on parole.\"The results of our two studies show that people incorrectly believe people on parole as more likely to be deceitful than participants without a criminal record, suggesting that the public in general underestimates redeemability and overestimates the stability of immorality in real life, across domains and over time,\" says Professor Vosgerau.\"The overestimation of the persistence of other people's immorality can have detrimental consequences, as it contributes to an overreliance on incarceration as a response to crime as well as other punitive and stigmatizing attitudes and criminal justice policies.\" More information:Sarah Kuehn et al, The public's overestimation of immorality of formerly incarcerated people, Journal of Experimental Criminology (2022).

  "text": "Do politicians internalize the consequences of their war-related votes? A new paper published in the Journal of Political Economy finds that they do\u2014when their family is involved.          In \"No Kin in the Game: Moral Hazard and War in the U.S. Congress,\" authors Eoin F. McGuirk, Nathaniel Hilger, and Nicholas Miller compare conscription-related voting records of members of Congress with and without draft-age sons. They find that legislators with sons eligible for the draft are 7-11 percentage points less likely to vote for conscription than their counterparts with daughters of the same age.The authors compiled a dataset of the 248 roll-call votes pertaining to conscription that were undertaken in the United States House of Representatives and Senate between 1917 and 1974, a period which saw U.S. involvement in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War.The authors established which members of Congress serving during each of those four wars had sons of draftable age, as conscription in this period in American history only applied to men. The lawmakers with sons who could be drafted were more exposed to the direct costs of conscription\u2014their own children perhaps would be affected by the outcome of their legislative votes.McGuirk, Hilger, and Miller conduct several analyses in the dataset, comparing not only the likelihood of legislators with draft-eligible sons to vote for conscription against the likelihood of legislators with daughters of the same age, but also how legislators with sons above or below the upper age draft eligibility cutoffs voted.The idea is that a legislator with a son below the cutoff is potentially exposed to the potential costs of conscription, as their son could perhaps be conscripted in the future, while one with a son above the upper age cutoff had no risk of this. The researchers found that this latter group was 18.8 percentage points more likely to vote in favor of conscription than their counterparts with younger sons.But what are the mechanisms underlying this voting difference: are they simply manifestations of self-interest? Or is it possible that by having a draft-age son, some legislators endeavor to learn more about the social costs of conscription, which then informs their stance? The authors test how voting behavior of a legislator changes as their son ages from eligible to ineligible for the draft. If the latter were true, \"we should not detect a change in voting behavior, since this motive ought to persist long after the politician's own son ages out of eligibility,\" they write.They find that a congressperson is 12.7 percentage points more likely to vote for conscription one year after their son ages out of draft eligibility than they were the year before. \"This is unlikely to be caused by a sudden change in preferences or electoral motives,\" the authors write. Rather, private incentives are likely at play.Finally, McGuirk, Hilger, and Miller also test how this voting behavior affects a legislator's chances of reelection in times when conscription is either popular or unpopular, based on historical accounts of public opinion. For instance, the draft was more popular during wars in the first half of the 20th century and declined in popularity by the second half.If the draft is popular, senators facing reelection would seem to be more likely to vote in favor of it in order to increase their chances of reelection. The analysis shows that politicians with draft-eligible sons were indeed less likely to win reelection during World War I, while this effect disappears by the Cold War.Ultimately, the authors write, \"Our finding has implications for the broader literature on special interests and quid-pro-quo politics, as we show that legislators respond sharply to changing private incentives, which is an important assumption underlying many of these studies.\" More information:Eoin McGuirk et al, No Kin in the Game: Moral Hazard and War in the U.S. Congress, Journal of Political Economy (2023).

Improving the cultural and aesthetic experience of non-expert visitors is a critical task for art museums. In this study, the authors examined how museum-provided descriptions of art might influence a visitor's experience of the art.Thirty university students visited a modern art museum once and were given basic descriptions of each artwork (i.e., author, title, year, and technique). About one month afterward, ten participants returned and repeated the first visit exactly, while twenty participants returned and were given more detailed descriptions of each artwork, including its background and meaning.The twenty experimental participants spent significantly more time viewing each artwork during their second museum visit (with new, detailed descriptions) as compared to their initial visit. In contrast, the ten control participants spent significantly less time in the museum on their second visit (when given the same basic descriptions as before).The experimental participants also exhibited physical signs of excitement\u2014dilated pupils and increased skin electrodermal activity. Experimental participants described themselves as experiencing more positive and fewer negative emotions during their second visit, and the artworks as more comprehensible and less complex. However, they didn't tend to change initial assessments of their aesthetic appreciation for each artwork, even after receiving the more detailed description.The authors note these effects might be specific to modern art, which tends to be less familiar and perhaps less approachable for the average person than classical art. The findings suggest that museum visitors might benefit from modern art labels with more detail or explanations around the artwork, technique, and/or artist.The authors add, \"Reading detailed information about artworks leads to psychophysiological and behavioral changes, suggesting higher comprehension and liking and a more satisfying aesthetic experience.\" More information:Psychophysiological and behavioral responses to descriptive labels in modern art museums, PLOS ONE (2023).

  "text": "The first modern humans spread across Europe in three waves during the Paleolithic, according to a study published May 3, 2023, in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by Ludovic Slimak of the CNRS and University of Toulouse III, France.       The archaeological record of Paleolithic Europe leaves many open questions regarding the nature of the arrival of modern humans into the region and the nature of how these newcomers interacted with the resident Neanderthal populations. In this study, Slimak compared records of stone tool technology across western Eurasia to document the sequence of early human activity in the region.This study primarily focused on comparative analysis of tens of thousands of stone tools from two sites: Ksar Akil in Lebanon and Grotte Mandrin in France, that recently revealed the earliest Homo sapiens migration in Europe dating to 54,000 years old. The study analyzed their precise technical connections with the earliest modern technologies in the continent. The author identifies a similar sequence of three technological phases in both regions, suggesting three distinct waves of migration of Homo sapiens across Europe.                The paper provides evidence for three distinct waves of early migration of Sapiens in Europe from the East Mediterranean coast. The image shows three technical traditions of each of these Sapiens migrations. Phase 1, around the 54th millennium, is represented by the Neronian/Initial Upper Paleolithic; phase 2 by the Ch\u00e2telperronian/Early Upper Paleolithic around the 45th millennium, and phase 3 by the Protoaurignacian/Southern Early Ahmarian around the 42nd millennium. Credit: Ludovic Slimak, CC-BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)             These trans-Mediterranean technological connections allow for a reinterpretation of the pattern of human arrival in Europe and its precise relations with the Levantine region. Further examination of these apparent phases of human migration will establish a clearer picture of the sequence of events as Homo sapiens spread across the region and, in doing so, gradually replaced Neanderthals.Slimak adds, \"Until 2022, it was believed that Homo sapiens had reached Europe between the 42nd and 45th millennium. The study shows that this first sapiens migration would actually be the last of three major migratory waves to the continent, profoundly rewriting what was thought to be known about the origin of sapiens in Europe. Chatelperronian culture, one of the first modern traditions in western Europe and since then attributed to Neanderthals, should in fact signal the second wave of Homo sapiens migration in Europe, impacting deeply our understanding of the cultural organization of the last Neanderthals.\" More information:The three waves: Rethinking the structure of the first Upper Paleolithic in Western Eurasia, PLoS ONE (2023).

  "text": "Black mothers are the canaries in the coal mine when it comes to the mental and physical harms of stress from living with gun violence in America.          In the U.S., Black people are likelier than white people to reside in impoverished, racially segregated communities with high levels of gun violence. Research has suggested that living in violent and unsafe environments can result in continuous traumatic stress, a constant form of PTSD. Researchers have also linked experiences of violence and poverty to an increased risk of chronic disease such as cancer and cardiovascular, respiratory and neurodegenerative diseases.We are Black women and public policy and sociology professors who study health inequities and sustainable policy solutions. Our research has found that Black mothers who feel trapped in neighborhoods they perceived as unsafe because of high levels of community violence are more likely to report elevated PTSD and depression symptoms, as well as elevated stress hormone levels.The trauma of gun violence and systemic racism isn't simply a Black mother's story\u2014it's an American story.Health effects of feeling trappedOur research team sought to understand how stress from structural violence affects the body, specifically the immune system. We talked to 68 low-income single Black mothers living on the South Side of Chicago about how they deal with gun violence in their communities and how it affects their health.We asked these Black mothers to complete surveys that measured depression and PTSD symptoms. We also asked them to provide blood samples to examine the effects of stress at the cellular level, measuring the activity of genes that code for the receptors for the stress hormone cortisol. Looking at cortisol receptors offers a more cumulative measure of cortisol levels over time.Gun violence is an epidemic in the U.S.We found that about 65% of the mothers wanted to move out of their neighborhoods but could not afford to do so. These mothers felt trapped in areas with high levels of gun violence that fostered a sense of not feeling safe for adults and children. One mother in our study, whom we will call Ellan, described her neighborhood as dangerous and wanted to leave as soon as she could. \"I'm very terrified of my kids going out to the park, playing in front of the house,\" she said. \"And I'm afraid that a car might come past shootin' and one of my kids get hurt.\"Another mother in our study, whom we will call Skylar, felt she couldn't escape to a safer community. \"I don't really want to raise my kids there, but I don't have a choice. You know, cause it's what I can afford. But it's real violent.\"Mothers who felt trapped reported more symptoms of PTSD, like disturbing memories and dreams and reliving stressful experiences, than mothers who did not feel trapped. They also reported more depressive symptoms, such as feeling down and hopeless, taking little pleasure in doing things and having trouble sleeping.Mothers unable to afford the move to safer neighborhoods had lower levels of glucocorticoid receptors. Having fewer glucocorticoid receptors helped protect their bodies from being overwhelmed by high cortisol levels caused by stress. Nevertheless, high cortisol levels from chronic stress are linked to a number of negative mental and physical health outcomes.      Environment determines healthWhere someone lives, learns, works, plays and worships can determine their health and has the power to make them sick and cause premature death.Researchers have estimated that around 83,570 Black people die prematurely each year in the U.S. because of health disparities, using 2002 data. Some scholars have previously described this as equivalent to a plane full of Black passengers falling out the sky every day every year.Black people face systemic economic and health disparities in the U.S.It is important to note that it is not the racial makeup of where a person lives that shapes the significant disparities they face, but exposure to violence, poverty and lack of resources as a result of structural racism. Redlining, environmental contamination, food deserts and gun violence are a part of the racial capitalism, or exploitation of marginalized communities, that affect the health of Black women.What we are learning about the constant threats to the safety of Black mothers and their families also applies to the general American public.The rate of mass shootings is increasing. Firearm fatalities are a leading cause of death among children ages 1 to 19 in the U.S. Gun violence has harmed people while they are watching a parade, shopping at a store, worshiping, attending school and other ordinary events.Increasing access to wellnessUnderstanding the complexity of the exposome\u2014the word researchers use for environmental factors like gun violence that affect an individual's health and well-being\u2014can help extend the years of healthy life of groups who typically experience premature death. Building this knowledge requires input from people of color and others who have traditionally been pushed to the margins of society.We are currently creating a \"wellness store\" that places wellness tools and health knowledge at the fingertips of individuals, especially for those experiencing interlocking traumas such as racism, sexism, classism, incarceration, racial segregation and rural geographic isolation. These tools, co-created with community health workers and citizen scientists, range from phone apps to public policy designed to get stress \"out from under the skin.\" Our goal is to work with clinics, hospitals and community organizations to provide accessible tools to prevent illness.Black communities are filled with resilient and vulnerable individuals who deserve urgent policy solutions that lead to societal change. We believe that more investment in disease prevention and health equity can help the U.S. use the knowledge, technology and finances that it already has to help people access its most precious resource: a healthy life and the ability to pursue wellness.

Now, a researcher using Oregon voter data has identified an unintended consequence of automatic voter registration: a steep drop in party registration. These results have been published in the journal Electoral Studies in a paper called, \"The partisan costs of automatic voter registration.\" Additional authors include Todd Lochner, Dr. Robert B. Pamplin Jr. Associate Professor of Government at Lewis & Clark College, and undergraduate student Alex Webb, '22.The study results apply to back-end implementation of the automatic voter registration in Oregon. \"Back-end\" refers to a system where voters are automatically registered during a transaction at a government agency, like the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and then later have the option to register a particular party or to opt-out via mail. \"Front-end\" implementation systems provide potential voters with the option to choose a party or opt-out during the initial transaction. The researchers found a 66% decrease in party registration impacting Democratic and Republican parties similarly with little change over time post-registration. Third-party affiliation is also greatly reduced.Ellen Seljan, associate professor of political science at Lewis & Clark College and the lead researcher on the study, says, \"In our study, back-end automatic voter registration had a significant negative effect on party registration in the state of Oregon across all demographic groups. This negative effect persists over time and is sustained despite the large increase in registration caused by automatic voter registration.\"The data that Seljan and her colleagues used in their analysis came from voter files collected from the state of Oregon in 2017. The team was able to arrive at a causal estimate between automatic voter registration and party registration because of an historical Oregon statute that makes individuals born in even-numbered years more likely to have been registered to vote via automatic voter registration in 2016. This made it possible to study the behavior of a set of individuals by an external set of circumstances, as opposed to a particular trait or behavior.Seljan wanted to see whether the drop in partisan registration persisted over time, given the fact that voters can make adjustments to their registration in a number of ways. She tested for this by looking at updated registration records from the Oregon voter file from 2021.\"This four-year time span between the two voter files we examined\u2015from 2017 to 2021\u2015included a presidential primary which, like all primaries in Oregon, was limited to party registrants,\" says Seljan. \"The results suggest very little partisan mobilization occurs following registration.\"The political implications of lower rates of party registration could be significant, says Seljan. First, those who do not register with a party cannot vote in closed primaries in many states, including in Oregon. In addition, political parties may focus less on those unaffiliated voters, leaving a gap in political knowledge for a large part of the electorate. Also, previous research has shown that party registration transforms the way voters perceive themselves.\"Unaffiliated self-perception and categorical identity may be fundamentally different from those of party registrants,\" says Seljan.The authors note that the research's purpose is to demonstrate one unintended consequence of back-end automatic voter registration, not to imply such a system is undesirable.\"This particular way of implementing automatic voter registration is an excellent means of increasing both the number of registered voters and the eligible turnout rate,\" says Seljan. \"It just means there's an additional burden on political parties to take extra steps to woo those unaffiliated voters.\" More information:Ellen Seljan et al, The partisan costs of automatic voter registration, Electoral Studies (2023).

  "text": "Researchers from Duke University, University of Notre Dame, and Microsoft published a new Journal of Marketing article that examines using \"true normal prices\" during a sale as a way to reduce deceptive pricing tricks.          The study is authored by Richard Staelin, Joel E. Urbany, and Donald Ngwe.Does competition make firms more honest? Over 50 years ago, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) assumed the answer was yes when it stopped enforcing its deceptive pricing regulations. Since that time, competition has increased significantly, particularly in the crowded U.S. retail trade. However, contrary to the FTC's hypothesis, deceptive pricing has proliferated during the same period.This new article explains why competition is more likely to encourage rather than discourage deception. The researchers propose a possible solution: require firms using reference prices during a sale to also provide information on the true normal price of the on-sale item.The study starts by critically evaluating two assumptions that underlie the FTC's \"competition discourages deception\" theory:1) The first assumption is that inflated reference prices are largely ignored by consumers, who focus primarily on evaluating the actual selling price in a promoted deal. As such, price competition pushes selling prices lower and renders reference prices harmless.However, empirical research gives a different picture. A robust finding in the marketing literature is that the addition of a high regular price stated in a price promotion increases consumer willingness to pay. The research illustrates how much consumers value \"getting a good deal,\" leading to greater sales for the retailer when comparative prices are used.2) The FTC's second assumption is that competition drives out economic incentives to cheat. The theory is that, as competition heats up, firms have an economic incentive to be truthful and that any temptation to stray will be constrained by natural market forces.However, a number of recent economic models show the opposite; that is, the greater the competition, the more likely the firm will offer \"noisy\" information in an attempt to shield itself from this competition and in the process increase its profits.Three recent empirical examples provide consistent support for model development, each finding:consistent seller use of high reference prices at which products are never or rarely sold,consumer choice being altered by these often fictitious reference prices, andfirms experiencing financial gains from posting inflated reference prices.All this leads to the conclusion that there is a substantial negative impact of fictitious reference pricing on consumer welfare.      The value of firms telling the truth\"After evaluating several regulatory options, we conclude the best way to create real change in firms' behavior is to require them to tell the truth. Our proposal is to require firms to disclose an item's true normal price (TNP) whenever comparative prices are used in price communications,\" says Staelin.To illustrate, say that a furniture retailer puts a sofa on sale as follows:Regular Price $1399Sale Price $599Also assume, as is common, that in the past three months the retailer has offered the sofa for sale at a price of $1399 for just two weeks. For the other 10 weeks, the sofa was offered at $599. So, $599 is actually the price usually charged for the product.This \"most regular\" price would be posted alongside the other two prices as a legally required disclosure when a firm wishes to have a comparative price promotion.That is:Regular Price $1399Sale Price $599True Normal Price $599**Legal Disclosure. True Normal Price = the price most often charged by this retailer in the past three months.The leads to a question: Does providing TNP moderate the effect of a promoted Advertised Regular Price (ARP)? Urbany says, \"We examine this question through a controlled experiment with 900 participants, where the participants' choices in the study determined their total expected compensation. We find that the presence of an ARP with a sale price significantly raises the chance that a consumer will buy. However, adding TNP information drives out this effect of ARP.\"\"Our results support the premise that TNP provision would reduce or eliminate firms' incentives to give anything but honest information to consumers in their price promotions and it would have an impact on average market prices, promotions, frequencies, and firm profits. We hope this study leads to a lively debate on the topic,\" concludes Ngwe.

  "text": "Whether it is pressing deadlines, overwork, or employees feeling they are not being supported, anger in a work environment can be unavoidable. Over time, the anger and frustration can compound, causing anger to spread through the entire team or organization, creating what George Mason University expert Mandy O'Neill calls a \"culture of anger.\"          In her research, O'Neill, an associate professor of management at Mason's School of Business, found that a culture of anger not only leads to problems for individuals, such as increased alcohol consumption, work-family conflict, and high-risk behaviors, but it also presents problems for teams as a whole.In a study of a large retail organization, O'Neill found that employee anger stemmed from a culture in which employees did not feel supported by their managers, leading to more employee absences and higher turnover. Additionally, individual high-risk behaviors can lead to a decrease in workplace safety as a whole, including safety violations, accidents, and injuries.Recognizing a culture of angerO'Neill explains that when dealing with anger in a team environment, whether it's a workplace, group project, or sports team, it's important to draw a line between a team experiencing occasional anger and a team defined by a culture of anger.\"All emotions have a social functional purpose,\" said O'Neill. \"Anger can serve important purposes around, for example, moral outrage against social injustice, or action tendencies that cause a person to rise up against obstacles thrown in their way.\"However, in a culture of anger, \"it's not just one incident, one time that made everybody angry. Rather, it's when anger is kind of everybody's default emotion,\" O'Neill said.The underlying research has been published in a variety of journals over the past 15 years.Dos and don'tsO'Neill highlights two common methods of fighting anger that can actually make matters worse. \"Emotion suppression, which is essentially to put the lid on an emotion and not let it be expressed, is very destructive,\" said O'Neill. \"Even if you think you're not expressing [anger], it leaks out in ways that you may not necessarily be aware of or able to control.\"Additionally, O'Neill found that allowing members of a team to vent their anger without restraint can serve to intensify the anger. Paradoxically, venting can reactivate and spread anger rather than resolving or calming the feeling.So, what can be done to help improve an angry team culture?Through interviewing emergency responders at fire stations in the southeastern United States, O'Neill found that the most effective teams were those who supplemented feelings of anger with joviality.\"Expression of joviality and humor is a way of channeling anger in ways that actually can promote group bonding,\" said O'Neill.She also found that companionate love, \"the connection felt between people whose lives are closely intertwined,\" also helps fight anger. Affection and caring, for example, creates a sense of familiarity between members of a team that helps to resolve issues, and can make a jovial culture easier to foster as members of the team know how and when to use humor without going too far.O'Neill believes that introducing joviality and companionate love to a team can help team members work with anger to turn it into a positive, productive emotion. \"Anger paired with positive emotions lends itself to a very different scenario than if you have anger without these emotions,\" she said.O'Neill is actively engaged in organizational research, employing both quantitative and qualitative methods to the study of employees and organizational units. She has worked with organizations across a wide range of industries including health care, technology, emergency services, and retail.

  "text": "A popular explanation for climate denialism is that humans will adopt beliefs that accord with their political orientation, using their cognitive abilities to explain away identity-inconsistent information in a process called \"motivated reasoning.\"       To test this hypothesis, Bence Bago and colleagues challenged volunteers' ability to think rationally using time pressure and cognitive loads of varying intensity. The team recruited American participants from Lucid, a website that connects academics with online survey participant pools.The authors found that people who had the ability to deliberate free of cognitive load or time restrictions showed greater coherence between their judgments about climate change and their prior beliefs about climate change. The paper is published in the journal PNAS Nexus.Controlling for this effect, there was no significant residual relationship between partisan identity and judgment. For example, Republicans who believe in climate change were significantly more likely to disagree with arguments against the reality of climate change when they had adequate time to deliberate than when they were rushed and had divided attention.Evaluating new evidence as more reliable if it accords with prior beliefs is sometimes called \"confirmation bias,\" but such reasoning can also be entirely rational from a Bayesian perspective: Broadly speaking, previously established facts are likely to be true and new contradictory information from an uncertain source is likely to be false.The authors conclude that instead of trying to decouple discussion of climate change from politics, those who wish to communicate about the issue should primarily focus on providing accurate information.

  "answer_squad": " informal work",
  "text": "South Africa has one of the world's most expansive social grant system: 47% of the population relies on a monthly grant. Of these, 18 million are permanent beneficiaries and about 10 million receive a temporary Social Relief of Distress Grant. This was introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic for working age adults who do not receive formal social protection, such as unemployment insurance and for those engaged in informal work.          The vast majority of the grants are child support grants (R500 or around US$27 a month) paid to a child's primary caregiver based on a means test.There is ample, global evidence that such cash transfers bring many positive outcomes. For instance, they reduce child hunger, improve school attendance and help reduce poverty.Although social grants are spent largely on food, there is growing evidence that they are also used for productive investments in livelihood activities. These are actions people undertake to meet their basic needs such food, shelter and clothing. Recipients find various ways to \"grow\" their grant by engaging in informal work and other income generating activities.But not much is known about the nature and scope of these activities, or how the government and other social partners like NGOs, development agencies and corporate social investment (CSI) initiatives could support recipients' agency and strengthen their livelihood strategies. This is important to consider against the backdrop of South Africa's 32.8% unemployment rate.To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a quantitative analysis of social grant beneficiaries' employment status drawn from household survey data from 2008 to 2021. We wanted to get a better idea of how many grant recipients\u2014caregivers of children, older persons, people with disabilities and unemployed adults engage\u2014in informal work and income generating activities.We found that 31% of grant beneficiaries engage in informal work. These are jobs with no written contract and where the businesses are not registered for tax. They include care work, informal trading or self employment. In 2021, grant beneficiaries were 13% more likely to be doing informal work than formal work. There was a greater probability of child support grant beneficiaries being engaged in survival-oriented business activities (11%) followed by 9% of beneficiaries of the Social Relief of Distress grant and 4% of old age pensioners.Although the study found that the proportion of self-employed social grant recipients appears to be small, this is not the case when compared to self-employment (10%) as a proportion of total employment. In this regard South Africa fairs poorer than other upper middle income countries such as Turkey, Brazil and Mexico.Second, we synthesized the findings from three qualitative studies by post-graduate students of the Centre for Social Development in Africa and the Department of Anthropology and Development Studies at the University of Johannesburg.Grant beneficiaries' stories emerging from these studies show a strong desire to be productive\u2014such as having a job, or starting their own business and to find ways to improve income and personal and family well-being. They also faced significant barriers in promoting liveihoods, reducing poverty and improving psychosocial well-being. These findings point to the need to design multi-pronged poverty reduction strategies that combine grants with livelihood support services.      Livelihood activitiesParticipants across all three studies articulated a strong motivation to improve their lives. Others expressed a strong desire for independence, to be active and productive.In all three studies, regardless of the grant received and its value, interviewees said the grant monies were insufficient to meet their needs.They found various ways to \"grow\" their grant. Some were income generating activities like buying and selling of goods, providing services such as building, painting, photography, running restaurants or taverns, renting accommodation and traditional healing. Some played fahfee (a form of betting) or engaged in community gardening, sewing, recycling and beadwork.Others invested in future livelihood strategies such as supporting children with their job search. Some used their grants as seed money to cover business start-up costs, buy new equipment such as a chip fryer, beads for their craft work or to expand their existing operations.We also found that some recipients were investing a portion of their grants, primarily through stokvels (a type of informal credit union) or savings schemes. They hoped to reinvest savings in their businesses or to use the money during an emergency. Across the three qualitative studies, beneficiaries reported that households with multiple income streams were more financially stable.The most common barriers identified:women's childcare responsibilities in the home;the opportunity costs of working (such as high transport and childcare costs);a lack of jobs:lack of capital;lack of access to affordable micro loans;competition for customers from large retailers;a lack of experience, knowledge and skills in, for example, financial literacysome expressed concerns about crime and violence in the community.Few grant beneficiaries were able to access formal support services from the government. Only one group of women crafters engaged in bead work received support from a local cooperative. Most turned to their social networks, family and friends to support them, provide guidance, advice and financial assistance. Due to a lack of access to small loans, they turned to money lenders when they needed to access cash resulting in indebtedness.A major barrier also relates to the precarious nature of informal work and the lack of protection for vulnerable workers.Implications for social development policiesInformal work is a crucial livelihood strategy for grant beneficiaries who supplement their income through multiple livelihood activities. Most worked in elementary occupations, services, sales and craft related trade. A small proportion are self-employed, running survivalist businesses. This is contrary to the view that beneficiaries are passive and disengaged from the labor market or do not desire to work.There is a need for greater recognition of informal work and its role in poverty reduction as a national policy objective. Moreover, social grants plus complementary livelihood supports are needed. These include access to capital, credit and small loans. The development of knowledge and skills and mentoring and coaching are also critical.Few government departments target beneficiaries for livelihoods support such as small-scale farming and entrepreneurship programs. There is a need to explore innovative delivery modalities\u2014whereby livelihood supports may be crafted onto existing government programs. Incentives should be provided for those who wish to pursue productive activities.There is room to scale up livelihood support through existing governmental, NGOs, development agencies and CSI programs. However, more research and experimental intervention research is needed to inform the design of livelihood support policies and strategies.

  "text": "At the end of 2022 the Central Bank of Nigeria launched new banknotes. At the same time it also capped withdrawal of the new banknotes. The rollout of the currency change was shambolic. But it also led people to turn to digital financial services such as the use of point of sale (PoS) machines for payments in their transactions. Digital financial services are financial services which rely on digital technologies for their delivery and use by consumers. The Conversation Africa's Wale Fatade asks Iwa Salami, an expert in financial technology regulation and financial regulation in emerging economies, to explain the increase and its implications.          How did the botched currency changeover affect the way Nigerians used the banking system?The Central Bank set a deadline of 31 January 2023 for all old notes to be deposited in banks in exchange for new. The country was plunged into a currency crisis when all old notes were out of circulation and the new notes were hardly circulating. The ensuing scarcity of cash made life unbearably hard for Nigerians.One outcome was that Nigerians sought alternative ways to pay for goods and services using digital alternatives, such as point of sale machines. Between 2017 and 2022, the number of point of sale terminals in Nigeria grew significantly.In 2017, there were around 155,000 terminals, and this number has increased to roughly 1.1 million as of April 2022. Merchants and PoS operators handle the machines. Their operations are regulated by the Central Bank.It also resulted in a surge in point of sales transactions in Nigeria. There was a 40.69% year-on-year increase from the N573.72 billion (US$1.24 billion) transactions that was done in January 2022 to N807.16 billion (US$1.75 billion) in January 2023. Total cashless transactions also rose by 45.41% year-on-year to N39.58 trillion (US$85.96 billion) in January 2023.What are the most developed forms of electronic transacting in Nigeria?Point of Sale (PoS): These devices are installed both by traditional banks as well as by payment service banks. They are now ubiquitous throughout Nigeria\u2014in supermarkets, large retail outlets as well as in small-scale businesses set up for this purpose only.Payment service banks: These are technology driven companies licensed by the Central Bank to engage in banking activities. Examples are Hope and MoneyMaster.Fintechs: This includes any app, software, or technology that allows people or businesses to digitally access, manage, or gain insights into their finances or make financial transactions. A number of companies offer these services in Nigeria. They include Flutterwave, Piggyvest, OPay, Interswitch, Kuda and Remita.Online banking offered by traditional banks: All Nigerian banks offer online services. However, the services aren't always reliable. During the currency crisis, for example, platforms collapsed and customers were unable to transact. Digital platforms didn't have the ability to cope with the deluge of online transactions.Mobile money: Financial service offered by a mobile network operator and can be independent of the traditional banking network. A bank account is not required to use mobile money services\u2014the only pre-requisite is a basic mobile phone.Those offering this service include MTN and Airtel Africa. As with most other countries on the continent, mobile money uptake in Nigeria has been slow. The exception has been Kenya, where the launch of MPesa in 2007  led to a massive uptake in mobile financial services.In 2022, the Central Bank of Nigeria issued MTN the first license to operate mobile money services. It started operations in May. MTN is the largest mobile network operator in Nigeria.      Can you paint a picture of the banking landscape?In 2021 Nigeria had 122.3 million active bank customers. According to February 2022 data only 39% of Nigerians use the formal banking system.As has been shown elsewhere, mobile money offerings, as well as other digital services, can extend banking to the unbanked.In 2022 the volume of transactions performed electronically in Nigeria surged to the highest in five years. The total volume of the Inter Bank Settlement Scheme Instant Payment Platform transactionsrose by 613.1% to 5.2 billion in 2022 from 729.2 million in 2018. Its value also increased by 381.5% from N80.4 trillion (US$174.6 billion) as at 2018 to N387.1 trillion (US$840.67billion) in 2022.In my view, the spike in the value of transactions carried out at point-of-sale devices in Nigeria in January 2023\u2014they went up by 40.7% higher compared to the same month in 2022\u2014shows a wider adoption of digital payments. It is also an indication of the huge opportunities that mobile money operators and other forms of digital payments have in Nigeria.How does Nigeria's digital currency eNaira fit into the picture?eNaira was launched by the Central Bank in October 2021. However, less than 0.5% of Nigerians were recorded as using it a year after its launch.The Central Bank didn't have an adoption strategy for the eNaira planned ahead of the currency change over. This was clearly a missed opportunity.Although the aim of the currency was to facilitate financial inclusion and shrink the size of the informal market, it's fallen short of the mark. It is currently only accessible to those with bank accounts. So, despite a reported increase in the number of e-Naira wallets to 13 million since October 2022, and an increase in the value of transactions in 2023, a lot still needs to be done to drive widespread adoption by the financially excluded.Rethinking its architecture and policies to drive its adoption could include:making it accessible to all with a mobile phone;incentivising people to use it such as granting significant discounts when used to pay taxes and for other public services; andembedding mobile network or payments apps into Central Bank Digital Currency wallets for the wallets to be inter-operable with mobile network operators' infrastructure.A lesson of the currency crisis is that fintech offers a solution to the limitations of legacy financial institutions, and at the same time, they can help address the financial exclusion challenge in Nigeria.Had Nigeria appreciated the value of digital finance and particularly the key role to be played by mobile money operators, the impact of the crisis would not have been as painful.

  "text": "Math teachers who believe women no longer face discrimination tend to be biased against girls' ability in math. This is what we found through an experiment we conducted with over 400 elementary and middle school math teachers across the United States. Our findings were published in a peer-reviewed article that appeared in April 2023 in the International Journal of STEM Education.          For our experiment, we asked teachers to evaluate a set of student solutions to math problems. The teachers didn't know that gender- and race-specific names, such as Tanisha and Connor, had been randomly assigned to the solutions. We did this so that if they evaluated identical student work differently, it would be because of the gender- and race-specific names they saw, not the differences in student work. The idea was to see if the teachers had any unconscious biases.After the teachers evaluated the student solutions, we asked a series of questions about their beliefs and experiences. We asked if they felt society had achieved gender equality. We asked them whether they felt anxious about doing math. We asked whether they felt students' ability in math was fixed or could be improved. We also asked teachers to think about their own experience as math students and to report how frequently they experienced feelings of unequal treatment because of their race or gender.We then investigated if these beliefs and experiences were related to how they evaluated the math ability of students of different genders or racial groups.Consistent with our prior work, we found that implicit bias against girls arises in ambiguous situations\u2014in this case, when student solutions were not completely correct.Further, for teachers who believed that U.S. society had achieved gender equality, they tended to rate a student's ability higher when they saw a male student name than when they saw a female student name for the same student work.Teachers' unconscious gender biases in math classes have been documented repeatedly.Our study identifies factors that underlie such biases; namely, that biases are stronger among teachers who believe that gender discrimination is not a problem in the United States. Understanding the relationship between teachers' beliefs and biases can help teacher educators create effective and targeted interventions to remove such biases from classrooms.Our findings also shed light on potential reasons that males tend to have higher confidence in math and stick with math-intensive college majors even when they're not high performers.One big remaining question is how to create targeted interventions to help teachers overcome such biases. Evidence suggests that unconscious biases come into play in situations where stereotypes might emerge. Further, research suggests that these unconscious biases can be suppressed only when people are aware of them and motivated to restrain them.Since bias may take on different forms in different fields, a one-time, one-size-fits-all anti-bias training may not have a lasting effect. We think it's worthwhile to investigate if it's more effective to provide implicit bias training programs that are specific to the areas where bias is revealed.

  "text": "Artifacts made of stone, bones or teeth provide important insights into the subsistence strategies of early humans, their behavior and culture. However, until now it has been difficult to attribute these artifacts to specific individuals, since burials and grave goods were very rare in the Paleolithic. This has limited the possibilities of drawing conclusions about, for example, division of labor or the social roles of individuals during this period.          In order to directly link cultural objects to specific individuals and thus gain deeper insights into Paleolithic societies, an international, interdisciplinary research team, led by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, has developed a novel, non-destructive method for DNA isolation from bones and teeth. Although they are generally rarer than stone tools, the scientists focused specifically on artifacts made from skeletal elements, because these are more porous and are therefore more likely to retain DNA present in skin cells, sweat and other body fluids.A new DNA extraction methodBefore the team could work with real artifacts, they first had to ensure that the precious objects would not be damaged. \"The surface structure of Paleolithic bone and tooth artifacts provides important information about their production and use. Therefore, preserving the integrity of the artifacts, including microstructures on their surface, was a top priority,\" says Marie Soressi, an archaeologist from the University of Leiden who supervised the work together with Matthias Meyer, a Max Planck geneticist.                Elena Essel working in the clean laboratory on the pierced deer tooth discovered from Denisova Cave. Credit: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology             The team tested the influence of various chemicals on the surface structure of archaeological bone and tooth pieces and developed a non-destructive phosphate-based method for DNA extraction. \"One could say we have created a washing machine for ancient artifacts within our clean laboratory,\" explains Elena Essel, the lead author of the study who developed the method. \"By washing the artifacts at temperatures of up to 90\u00b0C, we are able to extract DNA from the wash waters, while keeping the artifacts intact.\"Early setbacksThe team first applied the method to a set of artifacts from the French cave Quin\u00e7ay excavated back in the 1970s to 1990s. Although in some cases it was possible to identify DNA from the animals from which the artifacts were made, the vast majority of the DNA obtained came from the people who had handled the artifacts during or after excavation. This made it difficult to identify ancient human DNA.                The pierced deer tooth discovered from Denisova Cave before DNA extraction. Credit: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology             To overcome the problem of modern human contamination, the researchers then focused on material that had been freshly excavated using gloves and face masks and put into clean plastic bags with sediment still attached. Three tooth pendants from Bacho Kiro Cave in Bulgaria, home to the oldest securely dated modern humans in Europe, showed significantly lower levels of modern DNA contamination; however, no ancient human DNA could be identified in these samples.      A pendant from Denisova CaveThe breakthrough was finally enabled by Maxim Kozlikin and Michael Shunkov, archaeologists excavating the famous Denisova Cave in Russia. In 2019, unaware of the new method being developed in Leipzig, they cleanly excavated and set aside an Upper Paleolithic deer tooth pendant. From this, the geneticists in Leipzig isolated not only the DNA from the animal itself, a wapiti deer, but also large quantities of ancient human DNA. \"The amount of human DNA we recovered from the pendant was extraordinary,\" says Elena Essel, \"almost as if we had sampled a human tooth.\" The findings are published in the journal Nature.

Credit: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology                 Based on the analysis of mitochondrial DNA, the small part of the genome that is exclusively inherited from the mother to their children, the researchers concluded that most of the DNA likely originated from a single human individual. Using the wapiti and human mitochondrial genomes they were able to estimate the age of the pendant at 19,000 to 25,000 years, without sampling the precious object for C14 dating.In addition to mitochondrial DNA, the researchers also recovered a substantial fraction of the nuclear genome of its human owner. Based on the number of X chromosomes they determined that the pendant was made, used or worn by a woman. They also found that this woman was genetically closely related to contemporaneous ancient individuals from further east in Siberia, the so called \"Ancient North Eurasians\" for whom skeletal remains have previously been analyzed. \"Forensic scientists will not be surprised that human DNA can be isolated from an object that has been handled a lot,\" says Matthias Meyer, \"but it is amazing that this is still possible after 20,000 years.\"The scientists now hope to apply their method to many other objects made from bone and teeth in the Stone Age to learn more about the genetic ancestry and sex of the individuals who made, used, or wore them.

  "question_squad": " What is imperative for society to successfully solve?",
  "answer_squad": " complex problems",
  "text": "A multi-lab replication of a 2006 study supports the role of peer sanction in promoting human cooperation. Cooperation is imperative for society to successfully solve complex problems, including climate change. One approach many groups have adopted is a system of peer sanctions for noncooperators.          Such a system incurs costs to participants, who must impose the sanctions, but can allow cooperators to feel more secure that their investments in the shared project will be matched by others. A 2006 study suggested that groups with peer sanctions outgrew and outperformed groups without a peer-sanctioning institution. In light of the current replication crisis in the social sciences,Sergio Lo Iacono and his colleagues attempted to replicate the 2006 study at seven sites in Europe. Each replication had 144 participants. Participants interacted anonymously in groups of 12 for 30 rounds. In each round, each participant could choose to join a sanctioning group or a non-sanctioning group. Next, each participant chose how many of 20 tokens to contribute to the collective. These tokens would be multiplied by 1.6 and divided equally among the group members.In groups with sanctioning institutions, there was a second stage of play, in which participants could \"punish\" participants who had not contributed adequately to the group project by taking away their tokens\u2014but at a cost to themselves.In five out of the seven replications, the original pattern from the 2006 study held up: the majority of participants eventually chose to join groups with a sanctioning institution, and participants in sanctioning groups cooperated and profited more on average than participants in groups without a sanctioning institution. In the remaining two locations, results were weaker than in the original study yet still favored sanctioning institutions.Overall, these findings show that the emergence and persistence of sanctioning institutions to support cooperation in public goods dilemmas is a robust phenomenon within the European context, according to the authors. The paper is published in the journal PNAS Nexus. More information:Sergio Lo Iacono et al, The competitive advantage of sanctioning institutions revisited: A multilab replication, PNAS Nexus (2023).

  "answer_squad": " Corporal punishment of children in Australia: The evidence-based case for legislative reform",
  "text": "Corporal punishment should be prohibited nationally and supported by a public education campaign and greater access to parental supports, according to a new research paper.          The three-tiered strategy to outlaw corporal punishment is outlined in the paper which reviewed laws in Australia allowing the practice, international agreements on children's rights, evidence of its adverse effects, and the outcome of legislative reforms in countries that have implemented bans.Professor Daryl Higgins, the Director of Australian Catholic University's Institute of Child Protection Studies, was one of the co-authors of the paper published today in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health.Professor Higgins said the paper, Corporal punishment of children in Australia: The evidence-based case for legislative reform, showed the time for excuses and inaction when it came to prohibiting corporal punishment in Australia was over. Globally 65 countries have implemented bans.According to the recently released Australian Child Maltreatment Study, of which Professor Higgins was a chief investigator, 61% of those aged between 16 and 24 experienced four or more incidents of corporal punishment in childhood.The ACMS research found while 38% of respondents aged 65 or over believed corporal punishment was necessary when raising children, the figure dropped by more than half to 15% for those aged 16 to 24.Professor Higgins said while the change in attitude was welcome, the paper published today showed there was a danger in waiting for support for corporal punishment to continue to fall.\"We cannot continue to ignore the conclusive evidence that shows corporal punishment significantly increases the risk of developing serious lifelong mental health disorders, often accompanies experiences of child abuse and neglect, and undermines a child's right to a life without violence,\" Professor Higgins said.\"It is time to ramp up our efforts to help parents and caregivers use positive parenting techniques rather than outdated and ineffective forms of discipline that do nothing but harm children and breach their right to safety.\"The paper argued corporal punishment had life-long detrimental effects on children including reducing trust and connection with those raising them, lowering self-esteem, increasing behavioral and mental health problems, and increasing the risk of substance abuse.It found in countries that had changed legislation and followed this with public education campaigns and alternative strategies for parents and caregivers, rates of corporal punishment decreased.The team of 14 leading Australian academics behind the paper called for a whole-of-government approach and the use of regular national parenting surveys to measure the impact of legislative change and monitor child well-being and the prevalence of maltreatment.

  "answer_race": " Women scientists are underrepresented in scientific research.",
  "question_squad": " What is the average amount of funding for women researchers?",
  "answer_squad": " $342,000",
  "text": "Women researchers received substantially less funding in grant awards than men\u2014an average of about $342,000 compared to men's $659,000, according to a large meta-analysis of studies on the topic.          Women were also less likely to receive second grants to continue their research. In first-time grant applications, proportional numbers of women and men scientists were approved for funding, but for re-applications, 9% fewer women who applied were approved than their male peers.These gaps are real barriers to women's long-term success in research and a problem for science itself, said lead author Karen Schmaling, psychology professor at Washington State University, Vancouver.\"Diversity tends to be associated with creativity and scientific progress,\" said Schmaling. \"If the genders aren't well-represented\u2014and all the intersectionality of race, ethnicity and nationality alongside gender\u2014then science might indeed suffer.\"For the meta-analysis published in the journal Research Integrity and Peer Review, Schmaling and co-author Stephen Gallo of the American Institute of Biological Sciences analyzed data from 55 studies on grant awards published between 2005 and 2020. This represents data on more than 1.3 million applications worldwide although the majority were in the U.S. and Europe.While more than half the world's population, women are still underrepresented in scientific research. This analysis found that women made-up only 36% of eligible applicants to grants, and only 30% actually applied.Men also typically requested more funding than women applicants. However, the authors note that in two of the studies where there was no gender difference in the amount requested, the women researchers still received less, showing what Schmaling called an apparent \"discounting of women's science.\"The analysis also found that Europe was more friendly to women scientists, granting about 6% more awards to women researchers than funding agencies did in the U.S. The authors said this likely reflects the United States' low standing in gender equality, ranking 53 among 153 nations, as well as many European countries' pro-active gender equity policies.The findings indicate a need to reevaluate the granting process itself, including the composition of review committees and the way they approve applications.\"Many funding agencies value what's called 'bibliometric measures' of someone's success, such as how many papers they've published and how many people cited those papers,\" said Gallo. \"Those measures are deeply biased and flawed, and don't necessarily reflect differences in scientific excellence. It might be time to move away from them.\"Past studies have shown that men tend to cite studies authored by other male researchers more frequently than those by women researchers and that they \"self-cite\" more often than women, meaning they reference their past work in new studies, helping to drive up their citation numbers.These types of things help entrench an already unbalanced system, and supporting women scientists throughout their careers is key to fixing this imbalance, Schmaling said.\"It starts really early with all these opportunities that are just less frequently extended to women,\" she said. \"If we want true change, especially in the U.S., we need think about being more encouraging and giving opportunities to young women scientists early in their career\u2014and before, when they are students.\" More information:Karen B.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the group that helped law enforcement identify suspects?",
  "answer_squad": " Sedition Hunters",
  "text": "How has online sleuthing successfully replaced wanted posters?          Researchers within the Virginia Tech Department of Computer Science answered this question by studying the crowdsourced online investigation that followed the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\"These online communities can provide real value, if they're organized in the right way,\" said Kurt Luther, associate professor of computer science and history. \"These aren't just digital witch hunts now that make false identifications. They can really make solid contributions to ongoing investigations by getting images in front of people, which is ultimately what law enforcement has been trying to do since those wanted posters 200 years ago.\"Led by Tianjiao \"Joey\" Yu, a Ph.D. student Luther co-advises, the group analyzed the online community Sedition Hunters to understand how the group successfully used Twitter to help law enforcement and prosecutors\u2014including the FBI and Department of Justice\u2014identify suspects who took part in the insurrection. Their work has been cited in multiple arrests and legal proceedings.Yu is scheduled to present the resulting paper, \"Sedition Hunters: A Quantitative Study of the Crowdsourced Investigation into the 2021 U.S. Capitol Attack,\" at an annual international gathering, the ACM Web Conference, May 2 in Austin, Texas.\"Oftentimes I don't see clearly the real-life applications of my research,\" said Yu, whose research interests include crowd intelligence, natural language processing, and linguistics. \"But with this, I feel like I'm really solving a problem and I'm really making a contribution.\"Yu and Luther collaborated on the project with Ismini Lourentzou, assistant professor of computer science, and Sukrit Venkatagiri, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington. Venkatagiri earned his master's degree and a Ph.D. in computer science in 2020 and 2022, respectively. Luther was his Ph.D advisee when part of this project was completed.The research team found the Sedition Hunters generally adhered to ethical investigative guidelines, successfully mined large troves of data to create multi-angle composite images, and used creative nicknames as hashtags to collectively refer to unidentified people of interest and reach a broader audience on Twitter.      \"They really focused on what they could do that was helpful and not harmful, and I think that's one of the reasons they've been able to sustain it for more than two years,\" Luther said.Crowdsourcing information as a crime-solving tactic is far from a new concept, according to Luther, who directs Virginia Tech's Crowd Intelligence Lab in Arlington.\"Arguably, the first manhunt followed the Abraham Lincoln assassination because it was the first time photos were actually used to try to identify some of the conspirators,\" he said.More recently, unsuccessful attempts to use online crowdsourcing after the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing cast a negative light on the method.Luther and the Crowd Intelligence Lab began to study the use of crowdsourcing in active investigations in 2017. He said the events of Jan. 6, 2021, provided a unique situation to study.\"It was the most heavily documented crime in history, according to Time magazine,\" Luther said. \"It's kind of this perfect storm of this significant event happening and this massive amount of documented evidence in photos and videos online that's being publicly shared, so it creates this opportunity for people who want to help law enforcement to be able to contribute.\"Luther said a key element of the community's success was law enforcement's interest in its discoveries, despite the mistakes that online sleuths made following the Boston Marathon bombing. \"They seem to be very receptive of what the community can offer,\" Luther said.According to the team's research, the Sedition Hunters account has more than 66,000 followers who produced more than 320,000 tweets with more than 1 million retweets between Jan. 12, 2021 and Jan. 12, 2022. Despite the large audience, the community's content is dominated by a small number of highly influential accounts. The majority of tweets requested other users to share content or shared information related to news or recent events.The research team found that, early on, the Sedition Hunters ran into an issue when some Twitter users falsely identified an individual in a tweet. Luther said was he impressed how quickly a few influential users were able to largely change that behavior.\"They said, 'Hey, no more naming suspects publicly. If you think you know who it is, send it to the FBI,'\" Luther said. \"And to a large extent, that's what the community did. The community evolved.\"The Sedition Hunters went on to develop pseudonyms for unidentified suspects, which they used as searchable hashtags. Luther credits the community's creativity, using humor to developing names such as #LittleRedRioter and #SlimMcTreason, as part of the reason the effort was successful.He also said he was surprised at the community's ability to locate and use open-source camera footage to create composite pictures of suspects. This helped to overcome barriers in the first images collected, such as wanted individuals wearing masks or being captured at useable angles.Yu said he was impressed at the Sedition Hunters' collective ability to take the content being generated on Twitter and develop other websites with high-tech features. He specifically pointed to the development of a timeline and map that connected to different video sources as an impressive investigative tool.\"That was really surprising,\" Yu said. \"They built several websites and it was really interesting to see people interact with all these fancy tools.\"Though overwhelmingly positive, Yu said he did see areas for future improvements. They include being more centralized, finding a better way to track the progress of each investigation, and more behavioral oversight within the group.Overall, Luther said the Sedition Hunters have shown they have the potential to greatly benefit law enforcement and society in general.\"This paper offers a lot of promise for how law enforcement and the public can work together,\" Luther said. \"Officials are getting a more diverse section of the population to see suspects and ultimately help solve crimes in an ethical and more effective way.\" More information:Tianjiao Yu et al, Sedition Hunters: A Quantitative Study of the Crowdsourced Investigation into the 2021 U.S. Capitol Attack, Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023 (2023).

  "text": "A team of researchers from the Complexity Science Hub (CSH) and Central European University (CEU) created more-detailed poverty maps using computational tools that bring together survey information, and data and images provided by public sources such as Google and Meta (Facebook).          The poverty maps for Sierra Leone and Uganda, two Sub-Saharan African countries with extreme poverty, will be presented early May at the Web Conference 2023 in Texas, US.For years, policymakers, planners, and researchers have relied on surveys and census data to track and respond to poverty. \"Gathering this information, however, can be time-consuming and expensive,\" explains research fellow Lisette Esp\u00edn-Noboa, a postdoc at CSH and CEU and first author of the study. \"And a census may not include hard-to-reach areas.\"\"If you ask why we need high-resolution poverty maps, the answer is simple. These incredibly detailed poverty maps can identify places in need that otherwise wouldn't be captured in maps using only census data,\" adds CEU associate professor M\u00e1rton Karsai, co-author of the study.\"In regions with a lack of direct information, it is challenging to estimate the socio-economic status of people. In our study we focused on two countries, Uganda and Sierra Leone, where high-resolution, large-scale estimates are not available,\" points out professor J\u00e1nos Kert\u00e9sz, head of the Department of Network and Data Science at CEU and co-author of the study.Datasets In the first step, the team gathered demographic data from two surveys. \"In particular, we focused on the housing characteristics questionnaire. This helps estimate household wealth by considering the quality and quantity of available facilities or assets at home,\" say the researchers.For both countries, International Wealth Index (IWI) scores were calculated. IWI indicates how well a home possesses a basic set of assets. The lower the value, the lower the quality of housing. And the higher the value, the wealthier the household.Second, Esp\u00edn-Noboa and colleagues compiled a second dataset of satellite imagery and geographic information system data provided by crowdsourcing and social media sources, like Google and Meta (Facebook).Over 900 features were extracted that offer insight into the economic status of the population, the infrastructure development of the area, and other wealth indicators. \"This data shows, for instance, how many antennas are located in a certain area, or the number of people visiting the same area. It can also indicate how many Facebook users own an iPhone,\" explains Esp\u00edn-Noboa.Credit: Central European UniversityModels The team created three machine learning models that were trained to determine not only a place's average wealth, but also its standard deviation. Ultimately, the goal is to provide a more accurate picture of the wealth distribution within each populated area. \"We wanted to know how wealth varied within an area, or if there was inequality,\" points out Esp\u00edn-Noboa.The models were trained to learn correlations between the demographic data and IWI scores and the features extracted from data and images provided by public sources. \"They learn, for instance, that a specific wealth value correlates to a specific set of features,\" says Esp\u00edn-Noboa. \"Next, we tested the models by asking them to predict the wealth of different areas.\"The team developed three models: one based on satellite imagery; a second on crowdsourcing and social media data; and a third on combining the two. \"We wanted to determine which features contributed most to wealth prediction,\" explained Karsai.Using the models, the researchers created maps detailing the poverty levels of communities in Sierra Leone and Uganda. They also created an interactive map tool where users can compare wealth inferred in both countries and explore the machine learning models.\"The performance of our models is comparable to the state-of-the-art and, in some cases, outperforms it,\" ponders Karsai. \"Importantly, we estimate not only the economic status of people living at a given location but also local fluctuations. Moreover, we find that different methods are needed for estimating high income (where satellite images provide good results) and poor regions (where metadata-based methods are the best).\"COVID-19 pandemic For three decades, the World Bank has documented a decline in the number of people living in extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $2.15 a day. This trend was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The number of people living in extreme poverty has increased by 70 million to more than 700 million.According to the World Bank, the recovery has been uneven since then. And most of the people still living in extreme poverty are in Sub-Saharan Africa, in conflict-affected areas, and in rural areas.Consequently, more accurate, timelier, and cost-effective ways of measuring poverty are urgently needed, points out Kert\u00e9sz. \"By combining traditional household survey data with nontraditional data sources, we can map poverty at a higher resolution and scale. This can help policymakers make better evidence-based decisions when designing programs that reduce poverty and inequality,\" says Kert\u00e9sz, who's also an external faculty member at CSH.

  "text": "As of 2021 it is estimated that world-wide the number of refugees and asylum-seekers is over 31 million. While academics and researchers have been attempting to capture global and domestic attitudes towards these vulnerable groups, many of these studies will report biased findings and influence public opinion and policy. That is why researchers surveying socially charged topics such as immigration must make sure their methodology doesn't reinforce common anti-immigration attitudes.          A team led by George Washington University researchers has done just that.Today, Philip J. Candilis, M.D. a professor of psychiatry at the George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences, will present the findings of a new study that debunks previous research showing that mere exposure to refugees increases hostility towards refugees and asylum policies.With the collaboration of Allen R. Dyer, M.D. Ph.D, Sean D. Cleary, Ph.D. and former GW medical student Sarah Qadir, the research was an international joint project of the George Washington University Global Mental Health Program and the Hellenic American Psychiatric Association, with data from a survey of nine non-governmental organizations working in Greece.\"Because these types of studies can be influential, we felt it was important to demonstrate that a previous study of anti-immigrant attitudes in the Greek Aegean islands was flawed,\" Candilis said.\"Without a carefully chosen target population and carefully structured questions, surveys can provide incomplete and biased responses\u2014responses that then inflame politics and policy and even fuel anti-refugee sentiment. That is why we choose to study a group that has maximum exposure to refugees\u2014humanitarian aid workers\u2014so our results drew very different conclusions.\"Using methods intended to mitigate bias through survey design, sample selection, and statistical modeling, Candilis said the team tested whether humanitarian aid-workers in Greece, a group that is heavily exposed to refugees, would remain tolerant, committed, and progressive in their views of the immigrant population.Their results showed that it is not primarily exposure to refugees, but factors arising from context, background, and education which held sway in determining attitudes. The study demonstrates that a combination of better techniques can result in more informative and less divisive survey results on hot-button issues, Candilis said.The abstract, \"Antiracism Ethics & Research in the Refugee Crisis: A Greece/US Collaboration,\" was presented May 2 at the 6th Annual International Forum on Ethics of the Athens Institute for Education and Research held in Athens, Greece.

  "text": "Governments and private contractors work together on countless functions, but when something goes wrong, who is to blame?          Zach Mohr, associate professor of public affairs & administration at the University of Kansas, is involved in a series of studies to examine how people determine blame and hold those in power accountable.While research has shown deaths in prisons have increased in recent years, there is little public data available about how those deaths occur in specific contexts. There are a few high-profile cases of deaths happening during transport like that of Freddie Gray in Baltimore, but the majority do not make national headlines.To better understand how people view such service failures, Mohr led one study that examined prisoner transport\u2014a common practice at local, state and national levels, although it is not clear just how often it is contracted. He and colleagues surveyed more than 1,000 respondents to understand whether contracting services for prisoner transport allows governments to escape blame if someone dies during the operation.Researchers found that blame does shift, depending not only on who provided the service, but also whether the victim was a fellow prisoner or civilian.The study found that people blame government less when a service is contracted, reinforcing the idea that governments can escape blame for failures by contracting services to private providers.\"Sometimes when there is government and contracted services it is hard to hold those folks accountable, or even know who to blame when something goes wrong,\" Mohr said.The study also found people blame government more when the victim was another prisoner.\"There are a lot of people that are harmed in prisons. The common narrative is that people might not care about prisoners,\" Mohr said. \"But this suggests that, if given all the information, they do care, and we hope that would help lead to accountability and realizing that people care more than we might think.\"Published in the journal Public Management Review, the study was written with Jared McDonald of the University of Mary Washington and Jaclyn Piatak and Suzanne Leland of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.The experiment asked respondents to read a vignette about a prisoner transport that resulted in a death. In some cases, the department of corrections was conducting the service. In others, a private contractor conducted the service. In some scenarios, a prisoner killed a fellow inmate, while in others the victim was a civilian. Respondents were then asked who they felt was to blame for the failure and if the characteristics of the victim made a difference.\"It's conclusive from our findings that contractors significantly reduce blame for governments in these types of failures,\" Mohr said. \"Which is a good reason for contracting services. But I should point out businesses do this, too\u2014contracting certain services to avoid blame.\"By examining whether the characteristics of a victim influenced blame, the researchers were able to test whether the fundamental principle of equal protection under the law is possible.Results showed people blame government more when the victim was another prisoner than when it was a bystander, contradicting social identity theory. That suggests people would not blame government more if the victim was of a lower social status, such as a prison inmate, compared to a citizen.Mohr said that shows when a death occurs in a situation where the government should have more control, blame is higher, Mohr said.An experimental look at how people assign blame when failures occur can help shine a light on public attitudes toward prison services and how prisoners are often treated like commodities, Mohr said.Better understanding of how people assign blame in such cases could ultimately lead to better policies for accountability and ensuring people are properly held to account when failures lead to deaths of people in custody, he said.

  "text": "Visitors to Richborough Roman fort near Sandwich in east Kent will now find a major new addition to the site: a reconstructed Roman fort gateway in timber, flanked by stretches of an earthwork rampart.          The gate has been built on the site of an actual Roman gateway, thought to date to the invasion of Britain in AD43 under the emperor Claudius. Recent re-excavation revealed the emplacements of the post-holes housing the uprights of the gate, inside a pair of north-south defensive ditches.The soil from these ditches would have been mounded up to create an earth rampart. These would have been a formidable defensive obstacle and typical of Roman military engineering of the first century AD.Roman military defenses normally enclosed a rectangular area for a camp or fort. The Richborough defenses are odd in that they do not do that, but instead cut off a long stretch of land along the shore on the eastern side of the site.Their full length to the north and south is unknown and much land to their east has undoubtedly been lost to erosion and the construction of the railway.What was the purpose of the gateway and defenses?The defenses look to be designed to secure a length of shoreline, leading historians to suggest that they were temporary defenses for a beachhead.The pottery from the very bottom of the ditches (therefore close in date to their digging) dates to the middle of the first century AD, so they have long been thought to be defending the beachhead for the Claudian invasion force.This force consisted of four legions of heavy infantry (some 20,000 men) along with a probably equivalent number of auxiliary troops, cavalry and light infantry. Such a force would have needed a very large beachhead secure area, to say nothing of anchorage for all the transports for the men, horses and supplies which sailed from the invasion base at Boulogne.At the time of the invasion, the Isle of Thanet really was an island and between it and the Kent coast was the Wantsum Channel (now long since silted up, turning Thanet into a peninsula). Richborough lay on the Kentish shore of the Wantsum, with a sheltered area for an anchorage or for beaching ships at the bottom of the sea cliff.The model for the new gate structure is one carved on Trajan's Column in Rome. The column commemorates the emperor Trajan's conquest of Dacia (modern Romania) in the opening years of the second century AD, some 60 years after Claudius' invasion of Britain.Footage of the reconstruction of the gateway.The monument was decorated with scenes showing the campaigns, with one showing Roman soldiers building a fort. The gate structure shown is one of the few pieces of evidence historians have for what these timber gateways may have looked like, since normally they have long since been demolished or rotted away.Though the scenes are very immediate and vivid, there are problems with them. The column was a propaganda piece, sculpted in marble and set up hundreds of miles from where the fighting took place, so there was quite a bit of artistic license involved.For instance, in this scene, the fortifications (which would have been of earth and turf and timber) are shown as if they were of masonry. Realism has been abandoned in favor of effect.There are also problems in practical terms. The structure recreated in Richborough would have been open to the elements, fine in the campaigning season in Dacia but not very practical in a Kentish winter, with a wind off the North Sea whistling around the sentries' subligacula (undergarments).An enclosed, boarded structure would have been much more conducive to military effectiveness.      Understanding Richborough's significanceRichborough remained an important entry point to Britain throughout the Roman period. Remains from nearly four centuries are now visible at the site, making it difficult for visitors to understand.As well as the Claudian ditches, there is the huge concrete base for a four-way arch built in the late first century or later to commemorate the acquisition of Britannia. Originally sheathed in white Carrara marble from Italy (only fragments survive), it has an inscription in gilt bronze letters.After the army moved on, Richborough became a major port with, among other things, an amphitheater, also recently excavated. In the third century the site was refortified, initially by triple ditches around the base of the arch, then with the impressive stone walls.In the fourth century it was part of a system of forts from Brancaster in Norfolk to Portchester in Hampshire, known to the Romans as the \"Saxon shore\", to keep the seaways safe.These layers of historic developments make Richborough a complex site to understand and the ditches of the Claudian beachhead have long been overshadowed by the later remains. This new initiative by English Heritage should bring one of the most significant monuments of Roman Britain out of the shadows.

  "answer_squad": " that when people enter higher education, they know exactly where they're trying to go",
  "text": "In the study of higher education, universities have long been viewed as pipelines, preparing students for productive careers in specific fields. But when it comes to understanding how students actually make their way through college, the \"pipeline\" imagery fails to capture the twists and turns real people often take along the way.          A group of scholars from universities nationwide are calling for a new model for the study of academic progress: an updated approach that accounts for the complexity of university curriculums and students' journeys through them, providing critical information for researchers, educators, and students alike.In a paper published in the journal Science on April 28, professors from nine universities\u2014including Stanford, Cornell, Columbia, Texas A&M, and the University of Pennsylvania\u2014urge researchers to replace the \"pipeline\" metaphor with a focus on \"pathways,\" a shift they say would both help and compel administrators to update established curriculums based on students' evolving preferences.\"In science, metaphors guide our understanding of a problem\u2014they shape our approach to observing the world and the way we communicate our findings,\" said Mitchell Stevens, a professor at Stanford Graduate School of Education and one of the paper's lead authors. \"The pipeline metaphor has been useful for many years, but it has come to limit our understanding of how academic progress unfolds.\"By shifting to a \"pathways\" model, he said\u2014with computational tools and techniques that have only recently become available\u2014researchers can transform insights from complex data on academic progress into effective curriculums and support.Rethinking an outdated modelThe pipeline metaphor is limiting for several reasons, the authors say. For one, it suggests highly structured, sequenced curriculums aimed at developing skills in particular domains. But many universities encourage students to explore and combine different areas of study, and (as at Stanford) to hold off on declaring a major until midway through their undergraduate experience.\"The pipeline imagery implies that when people enter higher education, they know exactly where they're trying to go,\" said Stevens. \"But universities are tasked with providing a full range of options. Students might enter thinking they're ideally suited for one destination and then learn they're actually better suited for another.\"The pipeline metaphor treats that kind of departure from the original destination as a \"leak,\" or a loss, rather than an entry onto another route to graduation.What's more, a pipeline metaphor suggests a lack of agency on students' part, the authors say. \"It assumes that students are inert substances being propelled through a structure by external forces,\" Stevens said. \"But of course, people are actively making decisions about their own education all along.\"A pathways model puts both student agency and the structure of the curriculum at the center, recognizing the interplay between them. It traces the various responses students have to certain academic offerings, identifying \"fateful\" points in students' academic progress where choosing a particular major is no longer feasible.This could help pave the way for interventions that promote equity, the authors write. Many factors go into how students decide on courses and majors, and research into this consideration process could reveal opportunities to intervene\u2014to increase students' awareness of their options and the possible consequences of their choices.\"Students enter the university with varying amounts of information and different presumptions about how much agency they have over their own education,\" Stevens said. \"If we can level the playing field of information about pathways and choices, we might mitigate inequalities in college knowledge that people bring with them to school.\"      Applying new analytical techniquesIn conjunction with a new conceptual model, recent developments in computational science make it possible to analyze more complex data on academic progress, the authors write.Traditionally, researchers might use statistical techniques to chart enrollment patterns, observing cohorts of students episodically\u2014an approach that produces limited insight into how they consider, choose, and sequence each of their course selections, Stevens said. \"You'd default to inference about what happens in between those coarse points of data collection, which is very different from observing the process.\"Newer, more sophisticated computational techniques can better capture the micro-decisions students make and the effects of their choices. Advances in computational modeling can produce visualizations that reveal, for example, varying pathways into particular majors, critical forks on those paths, and curricular overlaps that could inform changes in course offerings and requirements. Machine learning techniques enable the ability to forecast major declarations based on courses selected early in the college career.To make the application of pathways science more accessible, the authors call for building a shared analytical framework and infrastructure, including a system for standardizing data across institutions, available as open-source analytic tools.

  "text": "As one of three co-teachers of a Stanford Graduate School of Business course on the rapidly growing importance of older consumers and workers, Rob Chess likes to say that his colleague Laura Carstensen, the founding director of the Stanford Center on Longevity, is the expert on aging; his fellow lecturer in management, Susan Wilner Golden, has the entrepreneurial angle covered; and he represents the demographic in question. \"I just got my Medicare card,\" he says with a chuckle.          A serial entrepreneur who has founded and led several successful biotech companies, Chess is having a bit of fun at his own expense. But the growing cohort of older adults he belongs to\u2014and the opportunity it represents\u2014is no joke.Thanks to advances in medicine and public health, people are living longer, healthier lives. The world's population of people 60 and older is growing five times faster than the population as a whole. Global life expectancy has doubled since 1900, and experts say that children born in developed countries now have a good chance of living to 100. A \"silver tsunami\" is already sweeping the U.S. labor force: the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that 36% of people ages 65\u201369 will remain on the job in 2024\u2014up significantly from the 22% who were working in 1994.These longer-lived, longer-working individuals generate an ever-bigger slice of global GDP and control an expanding tranche of global wealth. In her recent book Stage (Not Age), Golden estimates that the \"longevity economy\" is worth more than $22 trillion\u2014$8.3 trillion in the United States alone. That may be a conservative figure: AARP (the organization formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons) estimates that people over 50 already account for half of consumer spending worldwide, or $35 trillion. (This range of figures may have to do with how \"older adult\" is defined: The term is variously used to refer to people over the ages of 65, 60, or\u2014sorry, Gen Xers\u201450.)Yet the longevity market remains untapped by many businesses, which continue to ignore older consumers in favor of younger ones. \"People 50 and older hold the vast majority of wealth in the country, but we're producing products and services for people who don't have nearly as much money to spend,\" Carstensen says.Firms that do attempt to court older adults often fail to understand them. The situation reminds Chess of the computer industry in the early 1980s. At the time, he recalls, most people were focused on hardware. As a result, those who saw the potential market for software reaped outsize rewards. \"The people who recognized that early ended up being massive winners,\" Chess says. He sees a similar opening in the longevity market. \"most people's instincts are to focus younger, when the opportunity really is to focus older.\"Of course, older people do more than just buy stuff. Carstensen contends that virtually every aspect of our lives will be affected by our increasing longevity. \"The world we live in was literally built by and for young people,\" she says; yet for the first time in history, it now contains comparable numbers of toddlers and octogenarians.As people enjoy longer, healthier lives, many will have to rethink their educational, career, and retirement paths. Organizations, meanwhile, will have to reconsider how they recruit, retain, and manage employees. That will require us to grapple with deeply ingrained ageism\u2014a prejudice that Jeffrey Pfeffer and Ashley Martin, GSB professors of organizational behavior, describe as \"the last acceptable ism.\"The rewards for doing so, however, are potentially vast. \"This is a unique and unprecedented opportunity,\" Carstensen says. \"We have 30 extra years. How could we use those years to improve quality of life at all ages?\"      Mature marketsEngaging with older adults as consumers and workers can be complicated, partly because they are so diverse, ranging from people in their 60s who experience mental and physical decline to \"super-agers\" who are still working full-time or running marathons well into their 80s. \"The population 65 and over is more heterogeneous than any other age group,\" says Carstensen, a professor of psychology at Stanford who has cotaught the GSB course on longevity for several years. \"We can make some really good, informed guesses about what 5-year-olds are like. Try to do that for 80-year-olds; it doesn't work.\"Instead of segmenting older people into age brackets, Golden suggests looking at what stage of life they're at. This may challenge many assumptions about how our lives will unfold. She argues that the linear three-stage model of \"learn, earn, retire\" is based on outmoded ideas about lifespan and \"health span\": If you're going to live to 80 or 90 in relatively good health, it makes no sense to assume that your formal education should end in your teens or twenties or that you should retire at 65.Instead, many older people will likely cycle through a variety of nonsequential and potentially overlapping stages: working for a while, taking a break to raise kids, going back to work in a new role, taking another break to care for parents, retraining and reentering the workforce, taking another break to pursue other interests or additional education, and so on. An 80-year-old and a 40-year-old may occupy the same stage, and a 70-year-old may occupy several different stages simultaneously.Consider Golden's own trajectory thus far: She earned a master's in public health and a doctorate in health services, taught at Boston University Medical School, and had a successful career in venture capital before leaving the workforce to raise her daughter and care for her mother. She then returned to school at age 60, becoming a fellow at the Stanford Distinguished Careers Institute while her daughter was a freshman in college.Yet while older people appreciate not being crammed into a one-size-fits-all approach, openly acknowledging their age can be touchy. As Chess points out, older adults don't like to be treated as such. \"People who are 70 or 80 don't want to be marketed to as 70 or 80,\" he says. Consequently, he advocates for \"stealth design\": crafting products and services with older consumers in mind, but keeping the demographic targeting on the down-low. Ideally, this appeals to older folks without alienating younger ones who might be turned off by products and services that they associate with their parents and grandparents.Chess points to how BMW used research by MIT's AgeLab to redesign the controls of some of its high-end sedans. Though you might guess from the automaker's ads that its cars are meant for 30- or 40-somethings, the average Beemer buyer is 55 or older. Heterogeneity notwithstanding, most people experience joint stiffness and loss of visual acuity as they age. BMW's new controls, which feature bright primary colors and larger, easy-to-manipulate dials, are more user-friendly for older drivers yet still enjoyable for younger ones.Similarly, in recent years Merrill Lynch has revamped its approach to wealth management, moving from traditional retirement planning to a stage-based approach that employs teams of advisors to serve multiple generations within the same family. The company also pioneered the use of specially trained \"financial gerontologists\" to assist clients with issues like cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. As Carstensen and Golden detailed in a 2019 article in Harvard Business Review, this shift in strategy improved customer acquisition, retention, and satisfaction.Especially as careers last longer, older people can play a valuable role in designing and marketing products for their age-mates: identifying features that might attract folks in their 60s or 70s, for instance, or pointing out when a product intended for Millennials might appeal to Baby Boomers as well. \"The common theme in the longevity industry is 'designed with, not for,'\" Golden says.Distribution can also be challenging. Golden says there is a dearth of marketplaces for longevity-related services like caregiving and continuous learning. Chess points out that customer acquisition costs can be high in areas like home healthcare and end-of-life care, where need is difficult to predict and repeat customers are few and far between. \"You don't buy a funeral more than once,\" he says.Some of these challenges can be addressed by creating new marketplaces or taking advantage of existing distribution channels. For example, the startup Wider Circle (founded by Darin Buxbaum and Moshe Pinto, MBA '07), which builds social groups to reduce isolation and loneliness among seniors, sells its services through Medicare Advantage plans. Insurers that offer these supplemental plans like the groups because they produce health benefits and boost customer loyalty, thereby reducing costs and increasing revenues. Wider Circle, meanwhile, gains access to a large pool of potential users.Gray areasIf increasing longevity has the potential to remake the world of products and services, it has similar implications for the workplace. For example, age-diverse teams will become more common. And that is good for many reasons. Research by organizations such as AARP, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the World Economic Forum indicates that multigenerational teams perform better and create stronger talent pipelines.That's not to say there won't be problems. With four or even five generations working together in close quarters, the potential for intergenerational conflict will inevitably increase. According to Carstensen, more research is needed to understand the optimal composition of mixed-age teams so that managers can create environments where age diversity improves performance rather than generating friction. \"The devil is in the details,\" she says.Businesses will also need to revamp their benefits, compensation, and HR policies to attract and retain employees who are more likely to take career breaks. Research by ManpowerGroup indicates that 57% of male Millennials and 74% of female Millennials already anticipate taking such a break to provide childcare or eldercare or to support a partner.In 2008, Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee introduced corporate \"returnships\"\u2014return-to-work programs for people with previous experience who have spent time outside the workforce. Since then, more companies, including heavy hitters like Amazon, Apple, and Facebook, have launched similar efforts. They remain in the minority, however. Carol Fishman Cohen, the co-founder of iRelaunch, a platform that promotes midcareer reentry programs, notes that fewer than 10% of Fortune 500 companies had one in 2021.As that changes, however, the benefits should be felt across generations. \"I always thought that having older people in the workforce was going to be the best thing to happen to young parents,\" says Carstensen. \"They both want the same thing: flexibility\"\u2014namely, the ability to enter, exit, and reenter the workforce as they please.Retiring stereotypesFully embracing older adults in the workplace will also require confronting an old bias: age discrimination. Jeffrey Pfeffer, who is widely credited with inventing the field of organizational demography, wrote a prescient 1979 paper about the impact that an aging workforce could have on organizations. While acknowledging that a \"general prejudice against age\" was evident in many aspects of American culture at the time, he speculated that the situation might improve as the average age of the workforce increased.Four decades later, unfortunately, that prejudice shows little sign of abating. \"I think there's actually more ageism,\" says Pfeffer, who has written about the age discrimination he began experiencing in his professional life when he entered his 60s. (He's now 76.) \"It's perfectly acceptable to make comments about age that you would never make about any other social category,\" Pfeffer says.The federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 protects people who are 40 or older, yet it remains difficult to enforce. A survey by AARP found that 61% of adults over age 45 had either seen or experienced age discrimination in the workplace. Nearly one-fifth of the more than 61,000 charges filed before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2021 were age-related, with research suggesting that many more cases go unreported.Ashley Martin has found that even people who strongly advocate for gender and racial equality in the workplace still engage in \"succession-based ageism,\" the belief that older workers should step aside to make room for others. Otherwise fervent egalitarians legitimize this bias by arguing that older workers prevent younger people, women, and members of marginalized groups from moving up\u2014even though older workers are a disadvantaged group.Because it is more widely tolerated than other forms of prejudice, ageism may prove particularly difficult to root out. Age is rarely addressed in diversity trainings or mentioned in corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. According to Martin, fewer than 20% of diversity statements recognize age. \"The fact that we're not talking about [ageism] enough makes it such that we're not going to find productive ways in which to solve it,\" she says.Yet the tools to combat ageism may already exist. Martin's research indicates that age-related bias tends to abate when people come to understand that older adults aren't necessarily staying on the job simply because they enjoy working but also because many cannot afford to retire. This, in turn, suggests that ageism may be amenable to targeted interventions\u2014though Martin is quick to point out that all-purpose DEI initiatives are unlikely to solve the problem. Rather, organizations need to understand the specific attitudes their employees hold about older adults, and how (or even if ) those attitudes affect the workplace. \"In order for diversity trainings to be effective, you really need to understand people's beliefs in the first place,\" she says.Pfeffer, meanwhile, argues that legal pressure should be used to persuade organizations to take ageism seriously. \"I'm a huge believer in litigation,\" he says, adding that much of the progress made in the fight against racial and sexual discrimination was accomplished through the courts. \"The point is just to raise the cost of this form of discrimination.\"Carstensen thinks that the problem of ageism is best addressed by building a world where people of all ages can be fully engaged with and integrated into the workplace, the home, and the broader community. \"We have so many things we could do to make life better, and not just for old people: for children, for their parents, for workers and employers,\" she says. Businesses can play a vital role in that process if they have the foresight to make longevity part of their overall strategy.And given the speed at which demographic change is occurring, they had best begin doing it soon. \"As important as it is now,\" says Chess, \"it'll be vastly more important in 2030.\" Provided byStanford UniversityCitation:'We have 30 extra years': A new way of thinking about aging (2023, May 2)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-extra-years-aging.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_squad": " better access for ex-prisoners to essentials such as accommodation",
  "text": "Justice reinvestment emerged in the United States more than 20 years ago as a way to reduce mass incarceration and its vast costs by addressing the social drivers of imprisonment.          Through justice reinvestment, communities identify and develop responses to issues that feed high rates of re-incarceration locally, resourced through a \"reinvestment\" of funds drawn from prison budgets. The focus is often on better access for ex-prisoners to essentials such as accommodation and reducing inequity at a community level in health, education and other outcomes.The Albanese government is currently implementing its 2022 commitment to A$81 million in funding to support justice reinvestment initiatives in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.The New South Wales government also recently pledged $9.8 million for Aboriginal-led justice reinvestment initiatives in Kempsey and Nowra.But what does \"reinvestment\" mean in practice? Who decides what gets funded and how?To find out more, we spoke with Aboriginal communities in the NSW towns of Bourke, Moree and Mount Druitt.Our report, produced alongside these Aboriginal communities, aims to convey their understanding of justice reinvestment.This work invites government to co-design with community what \"reinvestment\" means, led by those Aboriginal communities where local solutions are already underway.Investing in Aboriginal-led solutions We heard that current criminal justice approaches are not working in Aboriginal communities like Moree and Mt Druitt. Far too many Aboriginal people are taken off-country to be locked up away from family, employment and schooling.This fractures community and cultural connections and other elements of a healthy, thriving Aboriginal community. The scale at which this occurs does more harm than good and drives re-incarceration. As one Moree community member told us:\"They just come out worse. It's like setting them up to fail. Like, it doesn't fix it at all. Do you know anyone that's gone to jail and come out and been good, like better?\"Aboriginal people in Moree and Mount Druitt know what's needed to turn this around. One Moree community member said, \"As we've been saying for years, we're the only ones that can tell people what's wrong, what's the best way to fix it. And we're the only ones that can actually do it.\"These communities have developed Aboriginal-led justice reinvestment governance structures and programs that strengthen culture and self-determination. They aim to improve life opportunities to keep more Aboriginal people\u2014particularly young people\u2014out of custody.In Mount Druitt, justice reinvestment includes Mounty Yarns, a project led by local young people with both lived experience of incarceration and ideas about how to reduce contact with the justice system that they want heard: \"We don't want the next generation to go through what we went through. We want to be a voice so others don't have to keep repeating their stories.\"Aboriginal communities like Moree and Mount Druitt need increased access to resources and decision-making to implement their solutions.They are calling for backing to put their ideas in motion, including partnerships, programs and interventions they identify as crucial to preventing offending.These ideas, once implemented, may work well quickly, take time to succeed or perhaps struggle. Increasing community agency is a crucial outcome in itself, regardless.      Funding justice reinvestment Diverting funding from prisons to resource justice reinvestment in communities like Moree or Mount Druitt is appealing to Aboriginal people. They want divestment from what they see as highly punitive institutions that have long caused significant harm.One idea for a source of funding might be a state-level mechanism requiring the NSW government to deposit an annual levy into a justice reinvestment fund.Funds could potentially be drawn from justice spending allocations, calculated on the basis of the number of Aboriginal people imprisoned in NSW in the year in question.Aboriginal people would determine where this money is spent, with priority given to justice reinvestment and other Aboriginal community-led and prevention-focused approaches likely to reduce over-representation.As this is achieved, the levy will reduce, as will justice and related costs for government.Importantly, the enormous social and economic costs for Aboriginal people of mass incarceration would also be averted. As one Mount Druitt community member told us:\"What's the outcome of prison spending? A criminal record. There's lots of things they can do before they chuck them into jail but that's the first option out here. Help him reconnect with his family, his culture. You could do a lot of things with that money.\"Aboriginal people in Mount Druitt and Moree told us of other ways to \"invest\" in community-led ideas for change.They want funding decisions to be informed by community knowledge of which services and programs will best contribute to outcomes likely to help keep Aboriginal people out of prison.One Mount Druitt community member told us: \"We've got no control here in Western Sydney. We need to have more of a say when we're getting in funding here. How is that funding going to be distributed?\"They have also identified \"tipping points\" that push Aboriginal people into the justice system. These include inappropriate or biased police decisions about bail, inadequate post-release support and school exclusions for younger people. They are calling for government reform in these areas.Achieving change The message from our report is clear: Aboriginal communities want to determine their own priorities for change and to lead that change. This is crucial to reducing Aboriginal over-representation.Commitment by governments to funding justice reinvestment initiatives is definitely a positive step in the right direction.Alongside funding, reform to government ways of working and policy will also be essential to ensuring justice reinvestment has the best chance of success.

  "text": "Parents share content of their children for myriad reasons, including to connect with friends and family, and to seek validation or support.          However, some parents also do this for commercial gain. They manage their children as social media \"kidfluencers\"\u2014allowing them to work with brands to market products to other children (and adults).The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's latest interim report for the Digital Platforms Services Inquiry has acknowledged key issues relevant to kidfluencers, including privacy concerns and possible labor exploitation issues.Our research, published recently in the M/C Journal, further highlights how the kidfluencer culture opens the door for possible child exploitation and a host of other problems.There is a clear need for regulation in this space\u2014and achieving it will require a considered, collective effort.Is YouTube the world's most popular babysitter?Speaking to Forbes in 2019, Eyal Baumel, the chief executive of Yoola (a management company which also manages digital child stars), described YouTube as \"the most popular babysitter in the world\".Since then, the COVID pandemic has prompted a surge in screentime for kids, who are being marketed toys as well as other products normally targeted to adults.Product lines for kids are big business. In 2021, the global toys market was projected to grow from about US$141 billion to $230.6 billion by 2028.It's now common to see YouTube kidfluencers marketing toys to other kids through toy \"reviews\". But these videos aren't the same as traditional product reviews. They're mash-ups that blur the lines between three major genres: reviews, branded content and entertainment.The most popular toy review channels have millions of subscribers, and their hosts are some of YouTube's top earners. Ryan's World is probably the most well-known channel in this genre. Conservative estimates suggest 10-year-old Ryan Kanji's family earns about US$25 million each year.      Instakids are on the riseApart from YouTube (now more popular among kids than television), a significant number of kids and teens are also spending time on Instagram.According to a 2021 report by child protection organization Thorn, about 40% of children under age 13 (out of some 750 interviewed) said they'd used Instagram. This is despite the platform ostensibly only being for people aged 13 and older.For our latest research, we analyzed the Instagram accounts of two Australian influencer siblings to better understand the nature of child-to-child marketing in 2023.Pixie Curtis, age 11, started her online toy store Pixie's Pix during COVID, when toy sales rose globally. This came after initial success selling hair bows through Pixie's Bows, a business managed by her mother, PR entrepreneur and reality TV personality Roxy Jacenko.Pixie's Instagram account (which has about 136,000 followers), and her brother Hunter's (20,000 followers), have been used to promote Pixie's Pix toys as well as other brands and products.And although Pixie recently \"retired\" from the toy shop business, she continues to promote products, including her original line of hair bows and other brands' skincare and beauty products.Our research identifies key areas of concern, including:a lack of online privacy for kidfluencers, who have many aspects of their lives publicized onlinethe commodification of children, and the enabling of a culture geared at up-selling them products and services the gendered marketing of toys and an increased focus on appearance for girls (which can be harmful for their self-esteem) the \"stealth\" marketing of toys and other products through advertorials.\rRegulation is needed nowSo far, the French government appears to be the only one that has taken tangible action to regulate the labor of child social media influencers. Under French law, children below age 16 can only work limited hours, and their earnings must be safeguarded in an account made accessible when they turn 16.France is also considering legislation to regulate \"sharenting\"\u2014a portmanteau of sharing and parenting that describes the practice of consistently posting content about one's children on social media.In the US, the Coogan Act (named after child star Jackie Coogan) was signed into law in 1939 to regulate child labor in the entertainment industry, but no equivalent laws have been enacted for child social media stars.Nonetheless, the problems surrounding kidfluencing are starting to gain attention around the world.Last year a UK House of Commons report investigated the implications of influencers targeting children with advertorials, especially those that provide little to no disclosure of the post being an ad.The committee made several recommendations, including promoting young people's social media literacy, developing a code of conduct for influencer marketing, and strengthening the powers of the UK's Advertising Standards Authority and Competition and Markets Authority.As a result, the UK's Department for Education is now \"open to exploring legislative ways of improving employment protection for child influencers\".The unintended consequences of regulationIn January, Meta (the parent company of Facebook and Instagram) held its first Summit on Youth Safety and Wellbeing. It might be trying to get on the front foot as regulators continue to scr\rutinise platforms on issues relevant to young people's social media use.But regulating in the kidfluencer space won't be easy. In March, Utah introduced laws to stop children under 18 having access to social media without parents' explicit consent\u2014but critics have pointed out the potential negative consequences.Teens use social media for important connections, including with friends and online support groups. Vulnerable teens may become isolated without online support from their peers. Beyond that, social media provide kids with a sense of enjoyment and identity. Taking this away could do more harm than good.More work is needed to determine what effective regulation would look like. While parents and educators have a role to play to increase children's social media literacy, digital platforms and businesses should also step up.

  "text": "Giving new college students opportunities to reflect on the ways science, technology, engineering and math can affect their lives makes them more likely to remain in degree programs in STEM fields, according to new research from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.          The effects described in the study, published May 1 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, were particularly strong for students from racial and ethnic groups underrepresented in STEM\u2014science, technology, engineering and math\u2014disciplines.More than 2,500 students enrolled in an introductory chemistry course\u2014nearly all in their first year of college\u2014participated in the study. Three times throughout the course, the students were given writing assignments about concepts covered in class, such as \"What factors determine the pressure of a gas?\"Half the students, the control group, were directed to write essays that addressed the question. The other half were told they also needed to explain how the scientific concept could be applied either to their own life or to helping others.\"Their answers weren't always deep reflections,\" says Judith Harackiewicz, a UW\u2013Madison psychology professor who studies motivation, and whose lab has been studying students in science classes for more than a decade. \"Some students did write about important connections\u2014such as how a chemistry concept might help a relative with cancer\u2014but others were as simple as how this relates to baking a pan of brownies for their friends.\"The impact of the reflection, however, was significant. Students who were asked to consider how science was relevant to them or society were 4 percentage points more likely to be majoring in a STEM field 2.5 years after the chemistry course (74% vs. 70% for the control group). Students who identify as members of underrepresented groups less likely to study and work in STEM disciplines\u2014including Alaska Native, American Indian, Black, Hispanic or Latino/Latina, and Pacific Islander\u2014and were assign the additional personal writing were 14 percentage points more likely to be on the path to a STEM degree 2.5 years later (69% versus 55% for the control group).The differences are particularly striking, according to the researchers, because they show that a small change in the science curriculum can help students stay on the path that brought them to introductory chemistry in the first place.      \"At the beginning of this chemistry course, 94% of students told us they planned to major in a STEM field,\" says Michael Asher, a UW\u2013Madison graduate student and first author of the study. \"It's a critical time for them. A lot of prior research shows that students can start to feel disconnected from their long-term goals in introductory science classes. They come in wanting to be a doctor or an engineer, but here they are putting long hours in on basic science stuff, like making diagrams of molecules.\"The assignments that incorporate personal reflections\u2014which the researchers call \"utility-value interventions\"\u2014about the personal and societal importance of even basic science skills seem subtle, but Harackiewicz thinks they tap into a powerful source of motivation.\"There has been considerable focus on helping students get better grades in these courses, and of course, better grades do predict persistence,\" says Harackiewicz. \"But to really understand why a student sticks with a STEM career through the difficult courses comes down to their motivation, and the kind of motivation that we study is around engagement and interest. These writing assignments are so powerful because the students are finding that relevance by themselves and getting more involved in their coursework.\"Asking students to reflect on the relevance of lecture topics may do more than pique their interest and improve their engagement. By weaving real-world importance into the step-by-step basics of science, students may see STEM fields and communities of professionals in a more appealing light.\"To encounter this in a class assignment may also communicate something about the culture of what STEM is like or what STEM courses can be like,\" Asher says. \"It's signaling to the students that the instructor values thinking about the science this way. It's possible that that's another important ingredient in what's happening here.\"The researchers and their collaborators are expanding experiments with their utility-value interventions to about 7,000 students in introductory STEM courses at universities in three states, collecting more detailed information on their experiences during pivotal early challenges and how the COVID-19 pandemic weighed on their goals and motivation.

  "text": "When the main character of a kids TV show can both listen and respond to viewers by using advances in artificial intelligence, youngsters learn more from the program. That's what my colleagues and I found in a series of peer-reviewed studies.          We are partnering with PBS Kids to incorporate conversational AI like Siri or Alexa into a popular science show for preschool-aged children called \"Elinor Wonders Why.\"In the interactive version we created, the main character, a curious bunny named Elinor, poses questions to children. She then listens to their responses and replies with feedback specific to their answers, or provides additional clues when needed.For example, in an episode about liquid thickness\u2014or viscosity\u2014Elinor and her friends try to get ketchup out of a bottle by shaking and squeezing it, but the ketchup remains stuck inside. Elinor turns to the viewer and asks, \"Why do you think the ketchup isn't coming out?\" Many of the kids in our study simply reiterated the problem by saying, \"It's stuck,\" without answering why. In this case, Elinor follows up by asking, \"Yeah, I wonder why the ketchup is stuck inside the bottle. Do you think it's too goopy, or it's too runny?\"We carried out several studies to test whether this interactive format indeed helps children learn more. In one study that we presented at the 2023 American Educational Research Association annual conference, we divided 240 children into three groups of 80. The first group watched the \"Elinor Wonders Why\" episodes in the interactive format we created. The second group watched the original broadcast without any questions or responses from Elinor. The third group watched a semi-interactive version similar to \"Dora the Explorer,\" where the main character asks a question, pauses as if she is listening and provides generic feedback. After the children watched the episodes, we assessed their understanding of the science concepts that were presented, including aerodynamics and reptile shedding.We found that children who watched the fully interactive episodes answered 63% of the assessment questions correctly, compared with 56% for those who watched the noninteractive version. Children who watched the semi-interactive version performed in between, correctly answering 61% of the questions.      We also examined children's responses to Elinor's questions during video watching. We found that children watching the semi-interactive version quickly lost interest in responding to Elinor's questions after they realized she could not comprehend their answers.Children in the U.S. spend an average of nearly two hours per day watching TV or online videos, according to a national survey. While platforms like PBS Kids provide free educational TV programs, the educational benefits can be limited by the lack of interaction with the content. The semi-interactive technique currently used in shows like \"Dora the Explorer\" and \"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse\" is still in wide use, but our evidence shows it is less effective than the AI-based interactive programs because of the absence of responsive feedback from characters.Recent advances in AI, particularly in speech technologies and interpreting language spoken by real humans, make it possible to enable true interactions between child viewers and children's TV show characters. This could make watching TV a more active and engaging way for kids to learn science.AI is being integrated into a range of media products, including e-books, smart toys and social robots. Meanwhile, advances in AI technology will likely increase its accuracy in processing children's speech, and therefore enable more natural interactions between children and AI. At the same time, researchers are also studying the ethical use of AI in media for young children to ensure that content that is developed is both educational and safe.We are currently exploring the possibility of developing children's TV show characters that can process bilingual children's mixed usage of English and their native language during interactions. A study involving children who speak Spanish and English is in progress.We also have plans to integrate AI into more PBS Kids shows, including an upcoming series called \"Lyla in the Loop,\" which highlights creative problem-solving for children ages four to eight.

  "answer_squad": " categorical authenticity",
  "text": "It turns out that pop stars Drake and The Weeknd didn't suddenly drop a new track that went viral on TikTok and YouTube in April 2023. The photograph that won an international photography competition that same month wasn't a real photograph. And the image of Pope Francis sporting a Balenciaga jacket that appeared in March 2023? That was also a fake.          All were made with the help of generative AI, the new technology that can generate humanlike text, audio and images on demand through programs such as ChatGPT, Midjourney and Bard, among others.There's certainly something unsettling about the ease with which people can be duped by these fakes, and I see it as a harbinger of an authenticity crisis that raises some difficult questions.How will voters know whether a video of a political candidate saying something offensive was real or generated by AI? Will people be willing to pay artists for their work when AI can create something visually stunning? Why follow certain authors when stories in their writing style will be freely circulating on the internet?I've been seeing the anxiety play out all around me at Stanford University, where I'm a professor and also lead a large generative AI and education initiative.With text, image, audio and video all becoming easier for anyone to produce through new generative AI tools, I believe people are going to need to reexamine and recalibrate how authenticity is judged in the first place.Fortunately, social science offers some guidance.The many faces of authenticityLong before generative AI and ChatGPT rose to the fore, people had been probing what makes something feel authentic.When a real estate agent is gushing over a property they are trying to sell you, are they being authentic or just trying to close the deal? Is that stylish acquaintance wearing authentic designer fashion or a mass-produced knock-off? As you mature, how do you discover your authentic self?These are not just philosophical exercises. Neuroscience research has shown that believing a piece of art is authentic will activate the brain's reward centers in ways that viewing something you've been told is a forgery won't.Authenticity also matters because it is a social glue that reinforces trust. Take the social media misinformation crisis, in which fake news has been inadvertently spread and authentic news decreed fake.In short, authenticity matters, for both individuals and society as a whole.But what actually makes something feel authentic?Psychologist George Newman has explored this question in a series of studies. He found that there are three major dimensions of authenticity.One of those is historical authenticity, or whether an object is truly from the time, place and person someone claims it to be. An actual painting made by Rembrandt would have historical authenticity; a modern forgery would not.A second dimension of authenticity is the kind that plays out when, say, a restaurant in Japan offers exceptional and authentic Neapolitan pizza. Their pizza was not made in Naples or imported from Italy. The chef who prepared it may not have a drop of Italian blood in their veins. But the ingredients, appearance and taste may match really well with what tourists would expect to find at a great restaurant in Naples. Newman calls that categorical authenticity.And finally, there is the authenticity that comes from our values and beliefs. This is the kind that many voters find wanting in politicians and elected leaders who say one thing but do another. It is what admissions officers look for in college essays.In my own research, I've also seen that authenticity can relate to our expectations about what tools and activities are involved in creating things.For example, when you see a piece of custom furniture that claims to be handmade, you probably assume that it wasn't literally made by hand\u2014that all sorts of modern tools were nonetheless used to cut, shape and attach each piece. Similarly, if an architect uses computer software to help draw up building plans, you still probably think of the product as legitimate and original. This is because there's a general understanding that those tools are part of what it takes to make those products.In most of your quick judgments of authenticity, you don't think much about these dimensions. But with generative AI, you will need to.That's because back when it took a lot of time to produce original new content, there was a general assumption that it required skill to create\u2014that it only could have been made by skilled individuals putting in a lot of effort and acting with the best of intentions.These are not safe assumptions anymore.      How to deal with the looming authenticity crisisGenerative AI thrives on exploiting people's reliance on categorical authenticity by producing material that looks like \"the real thing.\"So it'll be important to disentangle historical and categorical authenticity in your own thinking. Just because a recording sounds exactly like Drake\u2014that is, it fits the category expectations for Drake's music\u2014it does not mean that Drake actually recorded it. The great essay that was turned in for a college writing class assignment may not actually be from a student laboring to craft sentences for hours on a word processor.If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, everyone will need to consider that it may not have actually hatched from an egg.Also, it'll be important for everyone to get up to speed on what these new generative AI tools really can and can't do. I think this will involve ensuring that people learn about AI in schools and in the workplace, and having open conversations about how creative processes will change with AI being broadly available.Writing papers for school in the future will not necessarily mean that students have to meticulously form each and every sentence; there are now tools that can help them think of ways to phrase their ideas. And creating an amazing picture won't require exceptional hand-eye coordination or mastery of Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.Finally, in a world where AI operates as a tool, society is going to have to consider how to establish guardrails. These could take the form of regulations, or the creation of norms within certain fields for disclosing how and when AI has been used.Does AI get credited as a co-author on writing? Is it disallowed on certain types of documents or for certain grade levels in school? Does entering a piece of art into a competition require a signed statement that the artist did not use AI to create their submission? Or does there need to be new, separate competitions that expressly invite AI-generated work?These questions are tricky. It may be tempting to simply deem generative AI an unacceptable aid, in the same way that calculators are forbidden in some math classes.However, sequestering new technology risks imposing arbitrary limits on human creative potential. Would the expressive power of images be what it is now if photography had been deemed an unfair use of technology? What if Pixar films were deemed ineligible for the Academy Awards because people thought computer animation tools undermined their authenticity?The capabilities of generative AI have surprised many and will challenge everyone to think differently. But I believe humans can use AI to expand the boundaries of what is possible and create interesting, worthwhile\u2014and, yes, authentic\u2014works of art, writing and design.

  "text": "May the 4th is almost a religious holiday for Star Wars fans, when they make annual pilgrimages to re-released films in theaters, attend costumed conventions and plan themed parties.          If \"The Force\" is defined as \"a mysterious energy field created by life that binds the galaxy together,\" then May the 4th (as in \"May the force/fourth be with you\") is the calendar equivalent of that binding communal energy. The holiday, also known as Star Wars Day, was built by fans on a grassroots level to forge a sense of community and belonging (something humans have needed more than ever since the solitary height of the pandemic).\"In studying human social behavior, I find that a fundamental need in people's lives is the need to belong. People get that need fulfilled in a number of ways\u2014whether by attending church or joining a bowling league\u2014but, for some, it's through simply gathering around a common cult interest,\" said Gregory Webster, Ph.D., a psychology professor at the University of Florida (UF). \"For fans of Star Wars, May the 4th has become a kind of cultural phenomenon that provides that opportunity for connection.\"Webster has not only studied this need for belonging and connection, but he has also published research on why certain fantasy narratives in modern media connect so deeply to the human psyche. Last fall, he co-authored \"Personality perception in Game of Thrones: Character consensus and assumed similarity\" for the American Psychological Association's Psychology of Popular Media journal.The study examined Big Five and Dark Tetrad personality perception for 56 characters from the popular book-based TV show, and it showed that nearly all characters were \"gray\" (meaning they displayed both good and bad traits, which made them universally relatable). This type of storytelling and character development is equally evident in the Star Wars canon, which has fueled the longevity of the fantasy narrative.\"Star Wars is compelling because it follows that hero's journey narrative arc. People want to watch changes over time in terms of how a character evolves from good to bad (not just a character being a good guy or bad guy the entire time),\" Webster said. \"When you see characters that you care about and identify with, and when they face some of the same ethical choices in everyday life that you do, you really connect with them.\"      And people long to connect with other people who connect with these same stories and characters. This common thread, and the desire to continue interweaving, is what leads to fans creating events like May the 4th (which does not have a definitive origin but may likely date back to the release of the first Star Wars film in 1977).Certainly, the holiday has gained more mainstream appeal since the advent of social media, as fans from across the world have bonded and brainstormed thematic gatherings. As the franchise continues to grow, with series like The Mandalorian reeling in new generations of fans and Disney+ adding the Lucasfilm collection to its offerings, so does the global popularity of May the 4th.Andrew Selepak, Ph.D.\u2014a professor in UF's Department of Media Production, Management, and Technology\u2014often examines the communal impact of Star Wars in the context of media psychology and pop culture.\"Because the Star Wars universe exists in a fantasy realm, people look to it as a form of escapism. The more disconnected we become as a society, people have more of a need for a communal experience and escapism from a world that is not a great place,\" Selepak said. \"Connecting like this was particularly important during COVID, when people around the world were isolated. At the end of the day, we are social creatures, and May the 4th is a great communal idea, especially in 2023.\"In a word, May the 4th is wholesome. It is a genuine way for fans to connect to a world set in a galaxy \"far, far away\" with people who sometimes live far, far away\u2014and to relate about stories that are near and dear to their own hearts.\"At a time when neighbors can be divided over politics and everything else, having something that can bring people together like May the 4th is good thing, and there's no rivalry in it,\" Selepak said. \"If you're a Han Solo fan and someone else is a Darth Maul fan, you're not going to be combative over that; you're still going to show up at the same events and appreciate how someone else dressed up as another Star Wars character. We need more opportunities for this kind of positive connection these days.\" Provided byUniversity of FloridaCitation:How our shared need for belonging made May the 4th a sacred Star Wars holiday (2023, May 2)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-4th-sacred-star-wars-holiday.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "A team of archaeologists affiliated with several institutions in Denmark and Italy has found buried medical waste in a Renaissance-era landfill that was once the site of Caesar's Forum in Rome. In their paper published in the journal Antiquity, the group describes the origin of the landfill and its contents.          The Forum in Rome, dedicated to Julius Caesar, was completed in 46 B.C. as a site for conducting public business generally related to the Roman Senate. Much later, during the 16th century, the site was still usable\u2014Renaissance-era people used it as a hospital. Doctors of the time knew that diseases could be infectious, so they set up protocols for dealing with them and the clothes and tools used to treat ill patients.Prior research has shown that doctors and medical researchers in Italy played a major role in establishing protocols, such disposal of instruments after a single use, and disposing of potentially contaminated belongings by burning or burying them. In this new effort, the research team found evidence of such protocols in practice\u2014a landfill next to what was once a hospital where people of the time buried or discarded materials associated with caring for sick people.The landfill was discovered just two years ago, and since that time, teams of archaeologists have been slowly digging out the material discarded there to learn more about Renaissance-era medical practices. The team in this new effort focused their efforts on a cistern that was found in the landfill.                Glass urine flasks excavated from the cistern.

DOI: 10.15184/aqy.2023.34             The researchers note that the cistern had been intentionally sealed with a clay cap after it was filled with medical waste. Removal of the cap showed that the cistern had been filled with a large array of beads, jars, figurines and even coins, but most notably, with matula\u2014glass urine flasks.

  "text": "Ever clicked on a link because of a sensationalist headline or image? Or worse, shared it on social media without even reading it? If so, you've fallen victim to what's known as clickbait, and you're probably not alone.          \"Humans are the weak link in online safety,\" said Esma A\u00efmeur, a professor in Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al's Department of Computer Science and Operations Research.A\u00efmeur, a specialist in computer security and artificial intelligence, recently published a review of recent research on fake news, disinformation and misinformation on social media in the journal Social Network Analysis and Mining.In it, she examines the many varieties of fake news: from clickbait, considered the least serious, to conspiracy theories, which can be much more dangerous. Other types include satire, which uses misinformation to ridicule; hoaxes, which are false or intentionally fabricated news stories; propaganda, which is information of a biased nature created by political entities; and rumors, which are ambiguous and unconfirmed claims.\"It's important to know about the types of fake news so you can be on guard and recognize them on social media,\" said A\u00efmeur.That is the crux of her message: the only way to fight online disinformation is public education, awareness and vigilance.Humans are flawedA\u00efmeur believes that lack of user awareness is responsible for the proliferation of fake news and disinformation on social media.\"Recent stats show that the majority of fake news disseminated on social media is unintentional,\" she noted. \"There are five times as many people sharing fake news with no intent to mislead others versus people who do so intentionally. And the percentage of people who say they have confidence in their ability to detect fake information is 10 times higher than the percentage who do not.\"In short, users share fake content without realizing it and are convinced of its veracity. Thus, the problem lies not so much in people's bad intentions as in their lack of critical thinking.To overcome it, A\u00efmeur advocates teaching children to critically assess the information they read online starting in primary school and to continue raising awareness among users of all ages.\"The ordinary citizen is capable of detecting fake news,\" she said. \"But only if they're educated, stay alert and know they can't believe everything they read or hear. If you're going to use a powerful tool like social media, you need to be aware of its risks. A one-hour workshop on information security doesn't cut it; it has to be integrated into the school curriculum at all levels.\"The same applies to the conversation robot ChatGPT, which sometimes gives wrong answers and even \"hallucinates.\" Everything we read must be taken a grain of salt\u2014and a dose of critical thinking.A\u00efmeur stressed the importance of checking the source of a piece of information. There are a number of warning signs that it may be untrustworthy, including spelling errors, non-secure web addresses, recently created websites and, in the case of an email, an urgent or insistent tone.      New tools in the fight against disinformationIdentifying fake news remains a challenge. Apart from a sharpened critical sense, what tools do we have?According to A\u00efmeur, AI technologies such as machine learning and deep learning are not yet up to the task.In fact, these technologies can actually be used to create and disseminate fake content. A notable example is the deepfake, in which a person's face or body is digitally altered to make them resemble someone else. Another is the use of so-called collaborative filtering algorithms, which predict what content users like to see based on the preferences of other users with similar interests. This creates an information bubble in which users are only presented content that confirms their beliefs and viewpoints.On a positive note, A\u00efmeur pointed to some online resources that people can use to separate fact from fiction in what they read online. For example, websites like FactCheck, PolitiFact and Snopes regularly check and rate the factual accuracy of stories circulating online. The browser extension NewsGuard gives a trustworthiness score for the websites you consult. Google's reverse image search function and TinEye can be used to trace the source of an image, and LinkedIn to check an author's professional credentials.\"Fake news can fuel fears, reinforce biases, sow confusion, incite hatred and discrimination, and erode the public's confidence in democracy,\" said A\u00efmeur. \"We need to put our efforts into prevention and to educating people. If we don't act now, we're heading for a brick wall.\" More information:Esma A\u00efmeur et al, Fake news, disinformation and misinformation in social media: a review, Social Network Analysis and Mining (2023).

  "text": "Winston Churchill famously said, \"Democracy is the worst form of government\u2014except for all those other forms that have been tried.\"          However, that presumes people agree on what the term actually means.\"Not everybody understands what democracy is, and understanding of democracy is tied to support for it,\" said Valery Dzutsati, visiting assistant professor of political science at the University of Kansas.\"Moreover, misunderstanding is also tied to not supporting it.\"His new article, titled \"Under the Veil of Democracy: What Do People Mean When They Say They Support Democracy?\" and published in Perspectives on Politics, uses global cross-national survey data that demonstrates individual variation in the understanding of democracy is linked to democratic support across countries and regime contexts. The results suggest one must consider divergent conceptualizations when analyzing opinions of democracy.Co-written by Hannah Chapman of the University of Oklahoma, Margaret Hanson of Arizona State University and Paul DeBell of Fort Lewis College, the article notes there is no such thing as a perfect democracy.\"There cannot be because we as humans are not perfect,\" Dzutsati said.So what country is closest to the textbook definition of this system of government?\"That's a controversial question because specialists also have very different views on what is a democracy, how to define it and how to rank it,\" he said.Dzutsati points out, for example, how some of the most celebrated democracies (the U.S. included) often end up with a two-party system. And, theoretically, these should be less effective since they feature limited choices.\"But at the same time, we do see multiparty systems in Europe which are so multiparty that they become dysfunctional,\" he said.\"Coalitions are hard to build because there are so many parties and each of them holds a small share of votes, so it is easy to block decisions. It is perhaps a 'better' democracy in a way, but it's not functional. You want to live in a functional society because roads need to be built and things need to be kept in order.\"The researchers based their findings on the last three waves of the World Values Survey, including the most recent one from 2017\u20132022. The analyzed data encompasses 85 countries. According to their conclusions, an individual's knowledge of democracy is fairly low on average.      \"A significant proportion of respondents conflate things like army rule or religious cleric rule with manifestations of democracy,\" Dzutsati said.\"What it means for us as educators is we need better education so that people understand what a democratic political system is. And, by the way, the U.S. is not an exception. A lot of Americans who say they support democracy also say they support a strong man's rule\u2014a strong man who is a man of action who does things no matter what, disregarding the legislature and elections if needed.\"Then should America still be deemed a democracy?\"With a fair amount of confidence, I would say yes. Why? Because voting still matters,\" he said. \"You can disagree with a variety of things, but you cannot disagree with the fact that this country can change very significantly through voting.\"Dzutsati was raised in North Ossetia (in the southwest of European Russia). As part of the former Soviet Union, his country's official system of government described itself as \"democratic centralism.\" Interestingly, he said the Soviet Union had voting but didn't actually have elections.\"That was because for every electable position there was only one candidate,\" he said.\"You did go to voting booths, and it was made like a public holiday held usually on Sundays. There would be events and food. People would come and cast their ballot, which didn't mean anything. It was simply a confirmation of the existing order.\"Contemporary Russia is in a very similar situation absent the Communist ideology, he said. Many Russians do not see a better alternative to Vladimir Putin's regime, which vigorously promotes the belief of Putin's indispensability along with the idea that no true democracy exists anywhere. Incidentally, support for democracy is among the lowest in Russia according to World Values Survey data.Dzutsati earned his doctorate in political science from Arizona State University. He is an expert in politics and conflict of Eurasia and Eastern Europe, and his past work includes \"Secessionist conflict as diversion from inequality: The missing link between grievance and repression\" and \"Russia's Syria War: A Strategic Trap?\" (co-written with Emil Souleimanov).He said the last decade has been quite insightful when researching the ebbs and flows of democracies, particularly in the U.S.\"One big error we had a few years ago is we had this kind of linear view of development. The world and this country are becoming more and more democratic. Everything is fine. You don't have to do anything. Sit and relax. That's not the case,\" Dzutsati said. \"I hope we have learned this lesson.\" More information:Hannah S.

  "text": "Increasing women's representation in science, technology, engineering and math majors will reduce\u2014but not nearly eliminate\u2014gender disparities in STEM occupations, Cornell sociologists report in new research.          Overall, 36% of the gender segregation seen among college-educated workers is tied to their undergraduate degrees, according to the most comprehensive analysis yet of that relationship. The rest is attributable to labor market factors, potentially ranging from discrimination to family leave policies, that may sort men and women into different types of jobs even when they have the same degree.The findings suggest that integrating academic majors\u2014particularly those dominated by men and closely linked to specific careers\u2014will help slowly chip away at gaps in pay, prestige and other aspects of gender inequality at work. On the other hand, most of the problem unfolds outside of higher education.\"Integrating fields of study is an important mechanism for addressing gender inequality in the labor market, especially in STEM fields,\" said Haowen Zheng, a doctoral student in the field of sociology. \"But even if you do that, you still have a long way to go to integrate the labor market among college graduates.\"Zheng is the lead author of \"How Gender Segregation in Higher Education Contributes to Gender Segregation in the U.S. Labor Market,\" published April 10 in the journal Demography with co-author Kim Weeden, the Jan Rock Zubrow '77 Professor of the Social Sciences in the College of Arts and Sciences, and director of the Center for the Study of Inequality.College majors are assumed to impart skills and credentials that lead to job opportunities, such that the labor market will echo gender or racial disparities in fields of study. Attention and resources have focused most prominently on STEM degree programs as pipelines for diversifying the STEM workforce, but few researchers have examined the relationship across the full range of fields and careers.The new study fills that gap, analyzing a sample of nearly 2.4 million college graduates from five years of census data (2015\u201319), which tracked 173 undergraduate fields of study and more than 400 occupations.      The data highlights well-known disparities across fields of study, with a smaller share of women earning STEM degrees and a larger share earning degrees in health, social sciences, humanities and education. The researchers said integrating \"high-linkage\" fields that funnel graduates into a limited number of professions, including many STEM fields, would be most beneficial for integrating male-dominated professions, compared with \"low-linkage\" fields like liberal arts or international studies.But Zheng and Weeden, borrowing a methodology developed recently by scholars of residential racial segregation, calculated that the different undergraduate degrees among men and women have a modest effect in the labor market, accounting for roughly one-third of occupational segregation.\"After that,\" Weeden said, \"if the goal is to even out what's going on in the labor market, you have to look beyond fields of study in college to figure out policy levers for integrating labor markets.\"Most occupational segregation, Zheng and Weeden found, reflects segregation within fields. Particularly in heavily male-dominated fields of study, they found, male and female graduates tend to enter more different types of occupations. Among mechanical engineers, for example, women are more likely to focus on health-related applications.The census data doesn't contain detail about subfields and why men and women end up in them, but research has identified factors that can push women out of male-dominated fields or professions. They include unwelcoming or hostile work environments; policies related to household and caregiving responsibilities; organizational cultures that promote \"overwork\"; discriminatory views of women's competence; and sometimes women's self-evaluations of their abilities.Zheng became motivated to study gender segregation as an undergraduate studying English in China, where her field was dominated by women steered toward low-paying teaching jobs, while men were more likely to land higher-paying corporate employment. Research has also documented a stalled gender revolution, with occupations integrating less and pay gaps shrinking more slowly since the 1980s.Zheng said teasing out the role of college degrees in career outcomes for women and men was a step toward understanding what is driving those trends.\"Just integrating fields of study is not enough,\" she said. \"We need more research and policies to figure out why we still see so much gender segregation in the labor market, even when women and men are from the same fields.\" More information:Haowen Zheng et al, How Gender Segregation in Higher Education Contributes to Gender Segregation in the U.S. Labor Market, Demography (2023).

  "answer_race": " Gender differences in job search and the earnings gap.",
  "question_squad": " What is the average gender gap in accepted offers?",
  "answer_squad": " 16%",
  "text": "A new paper in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, published by Oxford University Press, indicates that an important part of the pay gap between men and women has to do with how they conduct job searches, with women more likely to accept job offers early while men tend to hold out for higher pay.          Women in the United States earn 84% of what men earn, as of 2020. This disparity is well documented, and economists and the general public have known about the earnings difference for decades. The reasons for this phenomenon are a matter of considerable debate.Initial conditions in the labor market are long-lasting. Young workers who begin their careers during a recession face lower wages for at least 10 years relative to cohorts that entered during better economic times. Since workers typically switch jobs several times over their lives, personal characteristics that matter in early-career job searches (i.e., risk aversion and biased beliefs about their earning potential) will likely matter for subsequent job searches.Since looking for a job is a complicated process that involves considerable uncertainty, differences in preferences and beliefs by gender are likely to lead to different job search behavior and outcomes. Nevertheless, economists know surprisingly little about how these attributes contribute to gender differences in early-career gender pay gaps.A likely reason for this is that researchers usually have limited information on job search behavior throughout the job search process, the offers that people receive, and measures of risk aversion and biased beliefs. Even in cases where such information is available, the focus is typically on unemployed workers in general and not on the gender dimension.But the evidence here comes from surveys on job offers and acceptances from recent undergraduate alumni of Boston University's business school, where one of the study's authors teaches. Researchers asked graduates from the 2013-2019 graduating classes details about the job search process that led to their first job after graduating, such as the characteristics of their accepted and rejected offers, including salary components, job characteristics, job offer timing, and when the offer was accepted or not.      In addition, for the 2018 and 2019 cohorts, researchers also surveyed students before the start of the job search process and collected data on students' subjective beliefs regarding the number of offers and wage offers, etc.The study's authors found that women, on average, accepted positions about one month earlier than their male counterparts (60% of women accepted a job before graduation, compared to 52% of males). There was a clear, large gender gap in accepted offers, and the gap narrowed in favor of women over the course of the job search. The average gender gap (i.e., male-female difference) across all accepted offers started at around 16% in August of the senior year and declined to about 10% eight months after graduation.The researchers here believe that this gender difference can be partially accounted for by men's greater risk tolerance and overconfidence in their salary potential. In fact, they find systematic patterns between these traits and search outcomes. For example, more risk-averse individuals reported lower reservation wages and accepted offers earlier.The findings echo a similar observation in the field where, relative to women, men are more likely to have rejected an offer that is higher than the one that they end up accepting, are less satisfied with the job search process, and regret some aspect of their job search.Taken together, risk tolerance and salary expectations may explain a sizable proportion of the observed gender difference in earnings. Overall, risk preferences account for about 20% of the gender gap in job search timing. Empirically, the net effect of wage and search timing results in a positive association between risk tolerance/overconfidence and the timing of job acceptance. Gender differences in risk preferences and salary overoptimism account for a non-trivial proportion (about 30%) of the gap in accepted earnings.\"Our study shows that differences in the way men and women search for jobs matter for gender pay gaps in early career,\" said the paper's lead author, Patricia Cortes.\"Gender differences in risk preferences and overconfidence about future job offers result in women having lower reservation earnings, which translates into earlier acceptance of lower-paying job offers. Gender differences in these traits may explain as much as 30% of the difference between men's and women's earnings in their first jobs.\" More information:Patricia Cortes et al, Gender Differences in Job Search and the Earnings Gap: Evidence from the Field and the Lab, Quarterly Journal of Economics (2023).

  "text": "One person's trash may well be another's \"come up,\" or what the rapper Macklemore calls hidden treasures in the song \"Thrift Shop,\" but only if secondhand shoppers follow the rapper's lead and dig through what are sometimes messy bins. New research from Penn State and Texas Christian University shows that shoppers looking to \"pop some tags\" may be drawn to disordered thrift shop displays because they signal hidden treasure in their inventory.          \"Secondhand markets are growing in popularity, especially among younger people,\" said Lisa Bolton, professor of marketing and Anchel Professor of Business Administration at Penn State. \"We found that disorder in these markets increases consumer perceptions of risk but also the possibility of finding hidden treasure.\"These perceptions work against each other, meaning that risk\u2014such as concerns about product quality or wasted time and effort\u2014decreases purchase likelihood while hidden treasure perceptions increase purchase likelihood, according to the researchers.\"We wanted to see what sellers can do to dampen risk perceptions and increase perceptions of finding hidden treasure,\" Bolton said. \"Just because shoppers enter a messy store doesn't mean they should walk away. There could be good deals to find.\"The researchers conducted four separate studies to determine how disorder in brick-and-mortar secondhand retail locations affects consumer behavior and what retailers can do to encourage purchase likelihood.\"Unfortunately, we were in the middle of a global pandemic, so going out to secondhand stores to talk to consumers directly was not an option,\" said Bolton.Instead, the researchers went online and asked participants\u2014most of whom reported having experience shopping in secondhand retail stores\u2014to view images of ordered or disordered retail displays. They were asked to value the products and rate their likelihood of making a purchase under different scenarios. Scenarios included going to a thrift store to casually browse items versus going with the intent to buy a specific item, shopping at a store that offered a clear return policy, and shopping at a store where the retailer demonstrated low to high inventory knowledge.The research team found that disorder in the secondhand retail marketplace enhanced perceptions of risk and finding hidden treasure, but that risk perceptions outweighed perceptions of finding hidden treasure for a net negative effect on purchase likelihood. When retailers instituted clear return policies, perceptions of risk diminished, but so did hidden treasure perceptions as customers questioned the special nature of the items.      When retailers demonstrated high inventory knowledge through their ability to answer customer questions and share the backstories of items, shoppers viewed the products as being carefully curated by the seller. In response, risk perceptions decreased and perceptions of hidden treasure and purchase likelihood increased. The researchers reported their findings in the March issue of the Journal of Retailing.\"Consumers like tidiness and organization, but in a thrift store, where items are constantly coming in, it's difficult to stay organized,\" said Gretchen Ross, assistant professor of marketing at Texas Christian University, first author of the study and a doctoral graduate of Penn State.\"We found that when displays are messy and the seller has high inventory knowledge, hidden treasure perceptions increase. Consumers think the seller must know what to pick for their inventory, and they're not going to choose poor quality items, which reduces risk and increases purchase likelihood.\"Additional steps secondhand retailers can make to increase perceptions of hidden treasure and decrease risk are to incorporate \"hidden treasure\" in their shop's name and build community either online or by hosting annual events, according to the researchers.The study suggests that disorder in the form of messy displays is not as damaging as secondhand sellers may think, said Meg Meloy, professor of marketing and David H. McKinley Professor of Business Administration at Penn State.\"In general, there is excitement when people are shopping secondhand,\" she said. \"We're now seeing giant online retailers offering returned mystery boxes, so there is an appreciation for and an excitement that builds around the possibility of finding hidden treasure. If a consumer naturally appreciates the potential for hidden treasure, they won't necessarily be put off by disorder in the marketplace.\" More information:Gretchen R.

  "text": "The police murder of George Floyd sparked nationwide protests in the summer of 2020 and revived claims that public outcry over such high-profile police killings perpetuates a violent \"war on cops.\" In a new study, researchers assessed if and how patterns of firearm assault on police officers in the United States were influenced by the police murder of Floyd.          The study found that Floyd's murder was associated with a three-week spike in firearm assaults on police, after which the trend in such assaults dropped to levels slightly above those predicted by pre-Floyd data. The researchers strongly caution, however, that this spike is not evidence of a \"war\" and argue that this rhetoric exacerbates current police-public tensions.The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin, the University of Nebraska Omaha (UNO), and the University of Utah. It appears in Criminology.\"The police murder of George Floyd in May 2020 sparked what experts have described as the largest social movement in history,\" write the authors. \"Floyd's murder also coincided with a once-in-a-century pandemic that sharply shifted the behavior of individuals and social institutions.\" This combination of changes, the authors suggest, presented significant challenges to assessing whether Floyd's murder by police had a significant effect on violence against police.In their study, Sierra-Ar\u00e9valo and his colleagues used data from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), which captures fatal and non-fatal firearm assaults on police across the United States, from January 2014 through December 2020. They analyzed firearm assault data in the months prior to Floyd's murder (before and after the onset of COVID-19) to isolate the effect of the murder on firearm assaults of police. They asked: Did the police murder of Floyd lead to a change in the frequency of firearm assaults on police across the United States?Floyd's murder was associated with an approximately three-week spike in firearm assaults on U.S police officers that revealed a significant increase in retaliatory violence, the study found. That spike quickly subsided to levels only slightly above what would be expected in the absence of Floyd's murder. Overall, Floyd's murder led to approximately 37 additional firearm assaults on police between May 25, 2020, and December 31, 2020, the study found. Approximately 26 additional firearm assaults were estimated to have occurred in the three weeks immediately after Floyd's murder.      Among the study's limitations, the authors note that GVA data are limited in that they exclude less injurious but far more common simple assaults against police, which prevents generalizing these findings to all violence against police. In addition, the study could not discount the possibility that some of the spike in firearm assaults related to Floyd's murder were driven by changes in police behavior and their perceptions of the public. For example, indiscriminate and excessively violent police tactics were documented at Floyd protests nationwide, which could have increased the likelihood that officers were assaulted.However, the authors stress that this increase must be interpreted in the proper context. \"While our results show a significant, short-term increase in firearm assaults on police following George Floyd's murder, the shooting of a police officer remains a statistically rare event.\" In light of this, the authors argue that popular rhetoric about a \"war on cops\" is unsupported by available data.In addition to being used to discredit police critics, impede police reform, and solidify police power, \"war on cops\" rhetoric may also be implicated in current recruitment and retention difficulties reported by departments across the United States. \"By reducing departmental staffing levels, 'war on cops' rhetoric may be reducing police effectiveness and response time in ways that, ironically, decrease officer safety,\" the authors note.Instead of continuing to use this kind of language, the authors suggest a focus on strategies that can simultaneously improve community and officer safety.\"In light of our findings, rather than continue to amplify unsupported notions of a 'war on cops,' police executives and policymakers who want to reduce violence should implement strategies to reduce firearm violence through a mixture of enforcement and non-enforcement intervention,\" write the authors. \"To do otherwise is to double down on political rhetoric instead of investing in evidence-based solutions that can enhance public and police safety.\" More information:Michael Sierra\u2010Ar\u00e9valo et al, The \"war on cops,\" retaliatory violence, and the murder of George Floyd*, Criminology (2023).

The remains were acquired by Walter Roth (1861\u20131933). Roth was a medical doctor, anthropologist, and the first Northern Protector of Aboriginal people. He eventually sold the remains to the Australian Museum in Sydney, which held them for almost a century before repatriating them to the Traditional Owners in the 1990s.The remains were reburied, but later exposed by erosion\u2014which prompted Gkuthaarn and Kukatj community members to invite us to collaborate with them.In research published in Archaeologies, we show how bioarchaeological techniques have helped shed light on the experiences of these young Indigenous people who were displaced by European colonization.Unfortunately, we only know the name of one of the eight individuals\u2014a young woman named Dolly. Roth's records indicate Dolly was a member of the Gkuthaarn and Kukatj People, and was working at the police barracks (shown in the banner image) in the town of Cloncurry, about 382km south of Normanton, when she died.Driven from their landsIn 2018, we published a study that showed these individuals had experienced nutritional stress and, in some cases, syphilis. These findings are consistent with other evidence relating to the experience of Aboriginal people living on the Gulf Country during colonial expansion.Archaeological data and historical documents indicate Aboriginal people on the Gulf Country lived as foragers until the mid-1800s, when their lands were occupied by Europeans and stocked with cattle. The cattle depleted resources that were critical for a foraging lifestyle, and conflict ensued.As a result of the violence and loss of resources, many Aboriginal people on the Gulf Country became refugees in their own land. They had little choice but to move into camps on the fringes of towns such as Normanton. These camps were overcrowded and unhygienic, and many occupants died from infectious diseases as a result.We spoke to several Gkuthaarn and Kukatj people during the course of our research. One senior person expressed feeling relief when the remains were safely retrieved and reburied:\"[Researchers] put a tarp over and dug it [the remains] up real steady. [They were] fragile from the sun [\u2026] We felt like we was just welcome [by the spirits of the people connected with these remains], like they wanted to get reburied. [We] just had that feeling they wanted to get reburied; was a couple of times they had been exposed.\"      Insight into displacement, disease and dietIn our recent study, we analyzed strontium, carbon, and oxygen isotopes from the teeth of six of the eight individuals.                Maps showing the location of Normanton relative to the Gulf Plains region and Cape York. Credit: Shaun Adams et al             Measuring isotope ratios in human bones and teeth can reveal information about an individual's diet and geographical movements prior to their death. When we compare strontium isotope values from tooth enamel to an isotope map (called an \"isoscape\") constructed for this project, we can see where the six individuals grew up.Dolly's strontium value suggests she grew up near the Gulf of Carpentaria. This is consistent with Roth's suggestion that Dolly was a member of the Gkuthaarn and Kukatj People, as their traditional territory extends to the coast. The strontium results for the other individuals suggest they grew up some distance to the east or northeast of Normanton.Carbon isotope results indicate that in their early years, all six individuals had diets dominated by tropical plants and/or marine foods. However, Dolly's carbon value suggests her diet was especially high in such foods. This is again consistent with her having lived near the Gulf of Carpentaria when she was young.The oxygen isotope results we obtained are also high when compared to international samples. We suspect these elevated values can be explained by a combination of the environmental conditions in the Gulf Country, and the effects of infectious diseases that spread into the region with European settlers.Based on the formation times of Dolly's tooth samples, and her strontium and oxygen values, we estimate she moved from the Gulf of Carpentaria to the Cloncurry area sometime between the age of 2.5 and 10. Our analyses also suggest she was a young adult when she died.These assessments are in line with Roth's reports from the Gulf Country, which state that Indigenous girls were often taken from their families and made to work for Europeans, and that it was common for such individuals to succumb to diseases early in life.Speaking on the findings, one Gkuthaarn and Kukatj person told us:\"I am sad to learn of our people getting horrible diseases and, with the study completed, these were young people who left behind such a sad story that needs to be told so non-Indigenous people, not just throughout Australia but particularly in our region, know and understand that these traumas still impact on our people 120 years later.\"The VoiceCombined with historical documents and information from contemporary Gkuthaarn and Kukatj People, our results provide new individual-level insight into the devastating impact of European colonization on Aboriginal people of the Gulf Country.Australians are currently debating a constitutional amendment to create an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to Parliament. The proposed amendment is a key recommendation of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Another key recommendation is that of \"truth-telling\" about the experiences of Aboriginal people during European colonial expansion.Science can't tell us whether the Voice is the correct course of action. Yet our findings about these individuals\u2014whose remains we have been honored to analyze\u2014reveal that scientific work conducted with and by First Nations people has an invaluable role in the process of truth-telling.We hope such work will help reveal more truth of the experiences of those rendered voiceless by the violence of colonization. As one Gkuthaarn and Kukatj person explained:\"My old grandmother was one of those people who said they was horrible and didn't want to repeat it [i.e. they did not want to tell accounts of colonial violence to subsequent generations], but I believe it should be repeated [to] help us understand more about what really happened. People [are] just listening to one side of it. You've got people who say Aboriginals just live off the welfare, but there was a reason why that happened. Aboriginal people fought for this country. You've got people who say you've gotta get over that [colonial violence], but what I say is: lest we forget.\" More information:Shaun Adams et al, The Impact of Contact: Isotope Geochemistry Sheds Light on the Lives of Indigenous Australians Living on the Colonial Frontier in Late 19th Century Queensland, Archaeologies (2023).

  "answer_squad": " \"ideal worker\"",
  "text": "UK deputy prime minister Dominic Raab recently resigned following the publication of a report into workplace complaints about his conduct, including bullying allegations. But this element of his behavior wasn't the only concerning workplace problem highlighted by the report.          It also detailed how, seemingly unencumbered by responsibilities outside work, his working hours ran from 7:30am until 10pm, Monday to Thursday, while Fridays were spent on constituency business, usually followed by extensive work on weekends.When organizations or leaders support such working practices\u2014either by working long hours themselves or rewarding those that do\u2014it can deepen inequality in the workplace. Setting an expectation that it's OK (or even necessary) to work beyond your contracted hours disadvantages those that need more flexibility, such as caregivers, who are typically women.Unfortunately, long hours are essentially a requirement for promotion in many managerial and professional jobs. Such working practices accord with the very values that led to the emergence of modern capitalism and the creation of the concept of the \"ideal worker,\" as argued by sociologist Max Weber. It's hardly surprising, then, that many organizations value and require long hours, even if they are inefficient.But long working hours undermine health, raising the risks of cardiovascular disease, chronic fatigue, stress, depression, sleep quality, self-perceived health, use of alcohol and cigarettes, and a host of other conditions and problems. Inefficiently long hours could also contribute to low productivity, as well as promoting gender inequality at work and in the home.Work flexibility versus career progressionFeminist scholars have also long pointed to the adverse effects of long hours on women in particular. Research shows this is a key source of the gender wage gap disadvantage. The UK's Equal Pay Act made a substantial difference in narrowing the gender pay gap, but long working hours still stand in the way of this progress\u2014particularly for those who have caring responsibilities, such as mothers. It is partly because of care that the gender wage gap continues to widen up to the age of 42. During this time, those who can't work excessive hours could miss out on career opportunities.Any kind of work flexibility can come at a high price in terms of career progression, as I found in my study of professional and managerial women's exit from work, conducted with organizational psychologist Emma Cahusac. We found that even women who continued to work full-time after having a child were disadvantaged because in professional and managerial work, full time often means being available any time. Many women are pushed into less interesting work because face time and on-call availability are disproportionately rewarded.Reducing women's domestic work can contribute to closing the gender pay gap. Numerous studies have shown that housework is negatively associated with wages. This is why it matters when men do much less around the home than women. Their contributions have gradually increased to a small degree, with men's involvement in childcare picking up more than their participation in the mundane daily housework tasks. But women still perform the lion's share, and tend to take responsibility for domestic work, taking on the \"mental load\" of making sure chores get done.Organizations reinforce this unequal sharing in the home when they make working long hours a pre-condition for success. Such company cultures uphold an unspoken \"gendered contract\" that it is women who are meant to perform care.      Working fewer hoursIf long hours are an ingredient of success in modern organizations, not everyone is convinced\u2014even those who benefit. I conducted a study with University of Luxembourg sociologist Robin Samuel which showed that on average even male breadwinners\u2014the main beneficiaries of the long hours system and those who actually work the longest hours\u2014would prefer to work fewer hours for less pay. Further, when male breadwinners want to work fewer hours, our research shows it's often because they feel their jobs interfere with their family lives.Recent examples of toxic workplaces should encourage debate about what it is reasonable to expect from employees. Gender inequalities relating to the reconciliation of work and care remain largely a side issue within organizations, although both the crisis of care and how people can accomplish work and care are critical issues facing our society. The #MeToo movement shone a light on sexual harassment, but it hasn't been the turning point many had hoped for in terms of boosting gender equality at work. There has been a substantial backlash to it, in part emanating from the gulf in understanding between those affected by such abuse and those who perpetrate or condone it.A similar divergence can be seen in discussions about toxic workplaces\u2014whether that's about bullying or deep-rooted employer expectations about working practices such as long hours, which systematically disadvantage some employees. Some people may see working long hours as linked to being robust, high-achieving, results-driven and demanding, others believe it diminishes employees and degrades the workplace environment.

  "text": "Politicians who are the parents of daughters provide researchers with a \"natural experiment\" to test how personal circumstances influence legislators' roll call votes. Research published in 2008, by author Ebonya Washington, showed that members of the U.S. House of Representatives with daughters cast more liberal votes on women's issues during the period between 1997 and 2005. But another study published in 2019 by researchers Mia Costa et al., covering the period between 2007 and 2017, did not find such an effect.          In their new paper \"Revisiting a Natural Experiment: Do Legislators With Daughters Vote More Liberally on Women's Issues?\" published in the Journal of Political Economy Microeconomics, Donald P. Green, Oliver Hyman-Metzger, Gaurav Sood, and Michelle A. Zee set out to investigate this question further with additional data. Using a larger dataset than those analyzed in the previous studies, they find that having daughters has no effect on how legislators vote on women's issues.The authors start their analysis in 1981, prior to the analysis presented in the 2008 paper by Washington, and in a time when, they posit, political polarization was \"relatively tame by contemporary standards.\" They end their analysis after the presentation of the 2019 paper by Costa et al. Subsequently, the researchers determine the gender proportions of the children of the lawmakers serving in these 20 total congresses, via archives and congressional offices.From the voting record, Green, Hyman-Metzger, Sood, and Zee determined which roll call votes during each Congress concerned women's issues, and coded each legislator's voting record according to whether it was pro-feminist. They also tracked specific legislators' votes over time, in order to study if the specific roll call votes held in certain Congresses influenced the results of the previous work.The authors find that, across sessions of Congress, having daughters has little effect on how members voted on women's issues. This finding holds over time. \"If party polarization dampens the daughters effect, going backward in time should increase the apparent average treatment effect,\" the authors say. \"This prediction is not borne out,\" they write\u2014the rise of polarization does not change this pattern.The researchers note that they successfully replicated the results obtained in the 2008 paper by Washington and the 2019 paper by Costa et al. \"The only era during which the daughters effect is positive is the one that Washington happened to study,\" they say.\"The daughters effect found by Washington is a thought-provoking empirical result that seems to demonstrate that roll call votes are influenced by legislators' personal circumstances and experiences,\" the authors write, while the lack of such an effect reported by Costa et al. indicate that perhaps partisanship has taken precedence over family influences as political polarization has increased.\"The findings presented here seem to support a more mundane interpretation: Daughters do not seem to have any appreciable effect on legislators' roll call votes,\" the authors conclude.

  "text": "Many human resource and talent acquisition systems do not recognize digital non-degree credentials that are often included on resumes and in job applications, according to a Northeastern survey.          Instead, most hiring systems remain geared toward traditional educational information\u2014such as bachelor's and master's degrees\u2014and unstructured data such as PDF attachments.Northeastern's Center for the Future of Higher Education and Talent Strategy surveyed 750 human resources leaders in partnership with the 1EdTEch Foundation to understand better how employers use digital non-degree credentials in the hiring process.The 2021 survey confirmed that hiring managers are interested in the growing adoption of digital credentials and skills-based hiring practices but found that technical integration between HR systems is a significant barrier.Half the respondents reported that data-rich learning and achievement records would challenge their current systems and processes. In contrast, the other half said their systems were ready to incorporate digital credentials.Educational institutions and professional associations are issuing millions of digital non-degree credentials. But there is a seemingly large disconnect between what applicants submit and what the employers see and use to make a hiring decision.\"You have this huge trend, but you don't have other systems keeping pace,\" says Emilee Trieckel, a research associate at Northeastern. \"We talk a lot about the potential of digital credentials, but for that to be realized, these other systems must work in concert.\"The rise of intermediaries like LinkedIn, Indeed and others often adds a third party between the job seeker and the employer. As an applicant's credentials pass through these websites, they're often reduced to the lowest common denominator\u2014bachelor's degrees and master's degrees, for example.So many job seekers are adding information or data to their applications that will never make it to employers to review.Online credentials started to pop up in the early 2010s. The massively open online course platforms such as Coursera and edX partnered with some colleges to provide low-cost online certificates.In parallel, some degree-granting institutions\u2014mostly community colleges\u2014ramped up their own non-credit certificate offerings such as quick boot camp programs.The report's main takeaway is that hiring systems are not equipped to accept most of them.\"There are millions upon millions of data points,\" says Sean Gallagher, the founder and executive director of Northeastern's Center for the Future of Higher Education and Talent Strategy and Executive Professor of Educational Policy.The purpose of the analysis conducted across 2022 and early 2023 is to explore how existing human resources technologies treat non-traditional educational credentials. The research used representative sample software providers, interviews and demos.The number of education and professional credentials available in the United States has grown significantly since the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.According to the report, there are more than 1 million unique credentials, including about 660,000 credentials from non-academic providers.\"How does that get mapped into some consistent structure on the employer side?\" Gallagher asked.

  "text": "A new book shares the stories of Ph.D. students, early-career researchers, and established academics during the COVID-19 pandemic to shed light on the struggles faced by those in the industry.          The COVID-19 pandemic impacted every aspect of our lives, and academia was no exception. A new book titled \"Research and Teaching in a Pandemic World\" offers an insight into the personal stories of those within academia who were impacted by the pandemic.The book provides an archive of firsthand accounts of people's pandemic experiences, highlighting moments of resilience and personal growth, as well as trauma, grief, and loss.Edited by a group of researchers from Monash University, Deakin University and the American University of the Middle East, the book focuses on how the pandemic affected individuals' ability to build their academic identity.By allowing each author to narrate their own stories, the editors were able to identify how each individual's pandemic experience affected their own academic identity.Through the stories of the chapter authors, the book reveals four key themes:The pandemic exacerbated already existing inequalities in academia, with many authors feeling marginalized and undervalued.Parenthood complicated matters for those in academia, as they struggled to balance home and work life, which often negatively affected their future career prospects.The pandemic profoundly impacted the mental health and well-being of those in academia, leading many authors to question their academic career aspirations, although there were also stories of resilience and coping strategies.Solitude was a recurring theme throughout the book. Connecting virtually to their research supervisors, their workplaces, or their students made Ph.D. students, early-career researchers, and more established academics feel disconnected from academia.\"The sudden disruption to or disappearance of everyday activities left academics feeling helpless. We understand now, more than ever, how crucial human contact is in an increasingly interconnected world,\" said Dr. Cahusac de Caux, Assistant Professor of Sociology at the American University of the Middle East.\"Research and Teaching in a Pandemic World\" provides space for individuals to explore their own experiences and what they have learnt through the process. It is a collection of stories which presents windows into the worlds of the authors and highlights the idiosyncratic impact of the pandemic on those in academia,\" said Dr. Lynette Pretorius, an Academic Language Development Adviser at Monash University.\"Throughout the pandemic, its magnitude has, at times, felt overwhelming to comprehend. Reports on daily case numbers, job losses, extended lockdowns, and even worse, deaths, were common everyday information. Yet, it is important to take stock and remember that behind each of these figures is a person with their own unique story. Our goal with this book was to give some of these stories a voice within our own professional network, which is academia,\" said Dr. Luke Macaulay, Research Fellow at Deakin University's Center for Refugee Employment, Advocacy, Training, and Education (CREATE).

  "text": "The UK now has some of the highest levels of neighborhood trust internationally, while Britons have also become much more comfortable with having neighbors who belong to historically marginalized groups, such as gay people, those of a different race, immigrants, and people who have AIDS.          Research by the Policy Institute at King's College London finds the liberalization of social attitudes in Britain is reflected in changing views of who the public say they would not like to have as neighbors, with attitudes softening towards several groups.Of around 20 countries included in the study, the UK now ranks as the most, or among the most, relaxed about living next to a range of people\u2014including those of a different religion and those who speak a different language.However, this increasing tolerance does not extend to all in society: compared with when trends began, the public have in fact become less open to people who are addicted to drugs being their neighbors, while a majority still take issue with heavy drinkers.The analysis was carried out as part of the World Values Survey (WVS), one of the largest and most widely used academic social surveys in the world, in operation since 1981.The groups asked about, as well as the terms used to describe them, therefore reflect the priorities and language of different eras, yet have not been altered given the value of tracking long-term trends in public opinion.The latest UK data was collected in 2022, with data for other nations collected at various points throughout the latest wave of the WVS, which spanned 2017 to 2022.The UK has some of the highest levels of neighborhood trust internationallyOut of 24 countries, the UK (84%) ranks behind only three\u2014Egypt (86%), Sweden (89%) and Norway (90%)\u2014for levels of trust in the people in their neighborhood.Other peer nations fare worse on this measure, such as the US, where 72% say they trust the people in their neighborhood.And unlike the US, where trust fell from 80% in the mid-2000s to 72% in 2017, the British public's trust in their neighbors has risen, from 78% in 2005 to 84% in 2022.Trust also varies geographically within the UK:Northern Ireland (90%) is the UK nation where people are most likely to trust those in their neighborhood, ahead of England (84%), Scotland (81%) and Wales (81%).In England, people in the South West (93%) are the most trusting of their neighbors.Britons have become much more comfortable with some\u2014but not all\u2014historically marginalized groups being their neighborsIn 1990, nearly a third (31%) of Britons said they would not like to have homosexuals as neighbors. By 2022, this had fallen to 4%.Similarly, in 1990, a quarter (23%) of the public said the same about people who have AIDS\u2014a figure that has also now declined to 4%.Looking further back, between 1981 and 2022, the share of the public who cited immigrants/foreign workers decreased from one in eight (13%) to 5%.And over the same period, the proportion who said they would not like to live next to people of a different race dropped from one in 10 (10%) to just 1%.However, attitudes towards two groups have hardened or at least remained very negative:In 2022, 83% of Britons said they would not like to have drug addicts as neighbors\u2014far higher than the 63% who said the same in 1990.The proportion who say they'd rather not live next to heavy drinkers has risen from 48% in 1981 to 57% in 2022\u2014although this is less of a clear upward trend.In both cases, there has been a notable increase in people feeling this way since 2018.The UK public rank as the most, or among the most, accepting of a range of different groupsOf nearly 20 countries, the UK emerges as the most comfortable with the idea of having various groups as neighbors:4% of the UK public say they would not like to live next to people who have AIDS, with only Germany (6%) and Brazil (6%) coming close to such levels of acceptance.Similarly, the UK (4%) ranks as the least likely to take issue with someone who speaks a different language being their neighbor. Other higher-income democracies such as Greece (14%) and Australia (10%) fare worse on this measure.Only 1% of the UK have a problem with unmarried couples or people of a different religion being their neighbors\u2014the lowest among nations analyzed.Of a larger sample of more than 20 countries, the UK is also among the most comfortable with the prospect of neighbors who belong to other groups:The UK (4%) ranks alongside Sweden (3%) and Norway (2%) as the most relaxed about the idea of having neighbors who are gay.People in the UK (2%) are among the least likely to say they'd prefer not to have neighbors of a different race, on a par with those in Brazil (1%), Sweden (1%) and several other western nations.Other high-income democracies, such as Italy (18%), Spain (13%), France (10%) and Australia (9%), are all more likely than the UK (5%) to have a problem with their neighbors being immigrants.But by international standards, the UK ranks as somewhat less tolerant of frequent drug users or drinkers:83% of the UK public say they wouldn't like to live next to drug addicts, with the country less accepting of this group than the likes of Spain (61%), France (57%), Norway (57%), but more accepting than Australia (94%), the US (92%) and others.A majority of 57% in the UK say they would not like to have heavy drinkers as neighbors\u2014lower than in some peer nations, such as Canada (80%), but much higher than others, such as Norway (29%) and France (41%).Perceptions of neighborhood safety and quality of lifeThe research also explores the quality of neighborhood life and finds the UK fares worse than some comparable nations on perceptions of how often illegal or anti-social behavior takes place.For example, people in the UK (28%) are four times as likely as those in Germany (7%) to say that drug sales happen very or quite frequently in their neighborhoods.And the UK is on a par with the US for perceptions of how often robberies (UK 21%; US 21%) and street violence and fights (UK 14%; US 16%) take place.But the UK does fare better on perceptions of sexual harassment, police or military interference with people's private lives, and racist behavior. On the latter, 13% in the UK say this is a frequent occurrence in their neighborhood, compared with 24% in the US.Professor Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute at King's College London, said, \"The UK public are highly trusting of the people in their neighborhood and very comfortable being neighbors with a wide range of groups, compared with many other nations and our own past views.\"\"It seems absurd that as recently as 1990 nearly a third of people in the UK said they'd be uncomfortable with gay neighbors, but this is now down to just 4%, and reflects a wider rapid change of attitudes, shown in increased acceptance of people from different races and immigrants. These shifts have been seen in other countries too, but the UK has often shifted more than many others, putting us now among the most open countries in the study.\"\"This does not apply to neighbors engaged in illegal or anti-social behavior, however, with drug users in particular the least welcome, and the UK more hardline on this than many other countries.\"\"Our high levels of neighborhood trust and tolerance are somewhat at odds with relatively widespread experience of local illegal or anti-social behavior\u2014for example, 28% of us say we've seen drug dealing in our neighborhood, which is on a par with the US and compares with 7% in Germany.\" More information:Report: www.kcl.ac.uk/policy-institute \u2026 ve-thy-neighbour.pdfProvided byKing's College LondonCitation:UK public among most trusting of their neighbors internationally and increasingly comfortable living next to outsiders (2023, April 28)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-uk-neighbors-internationally-comfortable-outsiders.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Consumer sentiment was essentially unchanged this month, edging up less than two index points from March, according to the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers.          Sentiment is now about 3% below a year ago but 27% above the all-time low from last June. Sentiment rose for lower-income consumers, offsetting declines among those with higher incomes. Buying conditions for durables surged 11% due to improvements in affordability, said U-M economist Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys.However, the persistence of high prices more broadly left consumers with high expenses, weighing down their personal finances. Overall, consumers perceived few changes in the economic environment since last month.\"The mild recovery in consumer sentiment we saw last fall and winter appears to have stalled. Consumers are bracing for the labor market to weaken,\" Hsu said. \"Sustained, meaningful improvements in economic conditions\u2014which will have to come from cooling inflation, given how little room there is for labor markets to strengthen\u2014will be required for their sentiment to rise again.\"Despite easing inflation, concerns over high prices persistWhile consumers have noticed that overall inflation has slowed in recent months, the prices they face day-to-day remain painfully high, Hsu said. About 40% of consumers blamed high prices for eroding their personal finances, up from last month and a year ago when overall inflation was even higher.Concerns over gas prices are starting to grow again, with about 17% of consumers spontaneously mentioning gas, fuel or energy prices, up from 14% last month. Furthermore, consumers expect gas prices to rise in the year ahead, which would exert even more pressure on household budgets.Credit: University of MichiganConsumers aware of bank failures but sentiment largely unaffectedThe full month of data now available following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank confirms that the financial turbulence that ensued had little measurable impact on overall consumer sentiment, according to Hsu. That said, the recent developments have weighed on a small subset of consumers. In April, 13% of consumers, primarily those with higher incomes, spontaneously mentioned bank failures during their interviews, up from 8% in March.Consumers mentioning bank failures had more favorable long-run economic outlooks than those who did not. Those mentioning bank failures held stronger views of their personal finances and may feel better equipped to weather any economic downturn to come.While consumer sentiment regarding the economy was generally unaffected by bank failures, their confidence in commercial banks deteriorated markedly compared with last fall. This decline in confidence did not spread to other financial institutions; consumer views of the Federal Reserve are little changed from six months ago.Consumer sentiment indexThe Consumer Sentiment Index rose to 63.5 in the April 2023 survey, up from 62.0 in March and below last April's 65.2. The Current Index rose to 68.2, up from 66.3 in March and below last April's 69.4, while the Expectations Index rose to 60.5, up from 59.2 in March and below last April's 62.5.

  "text": "Since the beginning of journalism in America, newspapers have been funded by advertising. In the 18th century, alongside advertisements for shoe repair, corduroys, and cutlery, colonial newspapers sold and ran ads for enslaved and unfree men, women, and children, usually in the form of \"runaway\" and \"to be sold\" ads.          These advertisements show something that scholarship on early American slavery has not always fully acknowledged, says Anjali DasSarma, doctoral student at the Annenberg School for Communication. Along with Linford Fisher at Brown University, the two show that the presence of enslaved and unfree Indigenous people was ubiquitous in the American colonies as late as the 19th century, long after the peak of the African slave trade.In a new paper, published in Slavery & Abolition, DasSarma and Fisher use a century of these ads, from 1704 to 1804, to trace the presence of Indigenous slavery in homes and on plantations throughout the American colonies and to explore the connection between journalism and slavery.Archives and advertisements\"This study was inspired by two projects,\" says DasSarma. \"Fisher is the Principal Investigator of Stolen Relations, which collects stories of indigenous enslavement, and I am deeply inspired by Freedom on the Move, which gathers 'runaway' newspaper advertisements about enslaved people in America.\"In \"runaway\" and \"to be sold\" ads, enslavers and slave brokers shared descriptions of the individuals they wished to be \"returned\" or were putting up for sale. Indigenous people were often referred to as \"Indian\" or a person with an \"Indian look.\" The earliest \"runaway\" advertisement referencing an Indigenous person was printed in a 1704 issue of the Boston News-Letter:\"Ran away from Capt. John Aldin of Boston, on Monday the 12th Currant, a tall lusty Indian Man call'd Harry, about 19 Years of Age, with a black Hat, brown Ozenbridge Breeches and Jacket: Whoever will take up said Indian, and bring or convey him safe either to John Campbell Post master of Boston, or to Mr. Nathaniel Niles of Kingstown in Naraganset, Master to said Indian, shall have a sufficient Reward.\"DasSarma uncovered this ad in a database of historical newspapers after months of combing through every ad that mentioned the word \"Indian\" between the years 1704 and 1804. There were over 75,000 of these in this database alone, which doesn't include every paper published during that time period.Many of these ads were used to sell goods like \"Indian blankets\" and \"Indian corn,\" but 1,066 advertised enslaved and unfree Indigenous people.      The scope of indigenous slaveryThe researchers used these ads to track the number of published advertisements by year and map the locations noted.\"We found ads for enslaved and unfree Indigenous individuals in every one of the original 13 colonies,\" DasSarma says. \"And there was a surprising consistency in the number of ads placed between 1704 and 1804. Indigenous slavery didn't taper off after the American Revolution.\"\"Our analysis of these advertisements reveal an overlooked and important aspect of the history of this country,\" says Fisher. \"America was not only built on Native American land, it was also built on the backs of Native American laborers, who were enslaved by the tens of thousands and who worked alongside enslaved Africans on plantations and in households well into the nineteenth century.\"National narratives and academic histories need to be revised to recognize this fact, they say.The complicity of journalismDasSarma, who studies the history of journalism, is interested in how early American newspapers' participation in the business of slavery factors into the relationship between communities of color and journalism today.\"There is a historic and contemporary distrust of newspapers within communities of color that can be traced, in my opinion, directly back to these types of advertisements.\" she says.Not only did newspaper printers directly profit from slavery by charging for these ads, but they also perpetuated the idea that slavery was acceptable.\"In a way, printers themselves acted as slave brokers by facilitating the buying and selling of people,\" DasSarma says.She points out that \"runaway\" ads are framed as calls to action, encouraging everyday newspaper readers to become slave catchers. Readers are promised rewards for the \"return\" of enslaved and unfree Indigenous individuals and some ads even warned that \"runaway\" slaves might \"pretend to be free.\"One ad reads:\"RUN-AWAY from the subscriber, living at New Lots, King's county, on Long-Island, the 16th instant, a negro fellow named NAT; has lost his right eye, about 24 years old, pitted with the small-pox, 5 feet 8 inches high, Indian hair, and of a yellow complexion: Had on when he went away, a whitish surtout coat, a homespun coat, and light colored jacket-Whoever takes up and secures the said fellow, so that he may be had again, shall receive Five Dollars reward, and all reasonable charges, paid by HENRY WICKOFF.\"This framing encouraged readers to constantly question the freedom and trustworthiness of Indigenous and Black citizens, DasSarma says, something she sees in crime reporting today.\"I think pointing to the complicity of newspapers in slavery is really important,\" DasSarma says. \"When you open a newspaper, you're promised truth, and in the 1700s, you opened a newspaper and saw people being advertised.\" More information:Anjali DasSarma et al, The Persistence of Indigenous Unfreedom in Early American Newspaper Advertisements, 1704\u20131804, Slavery & Abolition (2023).

  "text": "A trade war between China and the United States triggered by former president Donald Trump created an unexpected boost for Vietnam, new research has shown.          A series of tariffs introduced by the president between 2018 and 2019 covered some \u00a3200billion of Chinese goods and included 19,000 products, a move which left US-based businesses scrambling for alternative import options.One of the biggest 'winners' of the trade war was Vietnam which, according to new data, saw a 40 percent boost in its exports of tariff-affected products to the US between 2017-2020, as well as a significant increase in jobs and wages for Vietnamese workers.The results were published in a new paper, Trade Policy and Jobs in Vietnam: The Unintended Consequences of Trump's Trade War, co-authored by Dr. Pierre-Louis Vezina, Dr. Sanchari Roy and Anri Sakakibara, of King's College London, and Professor Lorenzo Rotunno, of the Aix-Marseille School of Economics.The researchers write, \"The value of Vietnamese exports to the US grew by 40 percent as a result of Trump's tariffs on China. This was driven by both increased exports in products Vietnam already exported to the US, and by an increased likelihood of new exports in Trump-affected products relative to non-affected ones. Previously exported products were also less likely to exit from the US market. This indicates that the adjustment for Vietnamese exporters to the Trump-induced trade shock occurred at both the intensive and extensive margins.\"\"Importantly, our results suggest that Trump's trade war led to an acceleration of the shift of manufacturing exports away from China and towards other emerging economies.\"In sectors targeted by the US trade tariffs, Vietnam saw a 15 percent increase in the number of jobs, while individuals worked on average an extra 50 minutes per week. While the gains in employment were mostly for men, women enjoyed higher wage gains, indicating that increased trade between Vietnam and US ensuing from the US-China trade war may have helped close Vietnam's gender wage gap.However, there was no sign that the increase in exports to the US resulted in occupational upgrading in Vietnam, with researchers suggesting this may have been because the new jobs created were predominantly in low-skilled occupations.The study is published on the preprint server SocArxiv.

  "text": "Three years after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020, many public health restrictions have been lifted and organizations are requiring workers to return to the office.          The desired return to pre-pandemic societal norms versus the pushback from employees who want to continue to enjoy the benefits of working from home has sparked debate about what the future job market will look like.Hybrid and remote arrangements became commonplace during the COVID-19 pandemic and became vital tools for the continued functioning of society, the economy and all levels of government.These arrangements enabled thousands of employees to keep their jobs, companies to remain operational and the public sector to continue providing essential goods and services to citizens.Dramatic changes to how we workConsequently, the pandemic caused sudden and profound changes to traditional work models.While some thought these changes would be permanent, a partial and gradual return to the conventional workplace has begun.Does this simply involve adapting the full-time, pandemic-fueled remote work model to current times, or does it signal a complete return to the pre-pandemic way of working?We're exploring the behavior and decision-making process of the government of Canada in terms of remote and hybrid work environments before, during and after the pandemic.Our analysis results from a thorough review of several official government documents, including new information released through access-to-information requests and additional informal observations and insights from the field.The evolution of remote workA year prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, the federal government started experimenting by offering \"new and flexible (shared) workplace solutions\" for employees in 14 departments who could work remotely.But prior to 2020, the number of Canadian employees who worked at home full-time was statistically low: Statistics Canada's General Social Survey 2016 reported that less than four percent of employees were working from home most of the time.This suggests that even though remote work was already recognized as a viable employment option by some organizations before the pandemic, it wasn't used efficiently as a widespread work arrangement until COVID-19.As a result of the pandemic, the government of Canada has provided guidance to departments and agencies to outline how the public sector can best provide remote and hybrid work arrangements to their employees in an effort to normalize this new way of working.      No direct contact with citizensThe pandemic has dramatically changed the way public sector employees work, especially in the federal government, where a wide variety of jobs don't require direct interactions with the public.As Evert Lindquist, a public administration scholar at the University of Victoria, has noted, remote and hybrid work models were accelerated by the digitization of the government:\"Many governments have instituted digital service agencies, established open data platforms, adopted social media channels, created innovation labs and proclaimed commitment to 'open government.'\"In the public sector, remote work became a way for governments to continue functioning remotely during COVID-19.Once the pandemic stabilized, the government of Canada began a gradual, partial return to the designated workplace, initially giving departments considerable latitude to experiment with different hybrid models and the opportunity to make their own choices with few limitations.But this strategy\u2014based on flexibility and managerial discretion\u2014didn't last very long.New rules were imposed by the Treasury Board Secretariat on departments in December 2022, including a requirement for public servants to work 40 to 60 percent of their regular monthly schedule at the designated workplace. These rules have been criticized by many who believe they mark the beginning of a return to the pre-pandemic way of working.Remote work as a negotiation issueAll these changes happening in a short period of time have created uncertainty and even distrust on the part of federal government employees toward their employers\u2014so much so that remote work is now a central issue in the negotiations for the new collective agreement with the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) representing 120,000 employees.The ability to continue to work from home is a point of contention, particularly pertaining to employees who were hired during the pandemic since they don't have a physical office and have only ever worked from home, especially those in rural areas.The federal government and federal employees are both navigating uncharted territories.On the one hand, those who currently work remotely want to preserve as much flexibility as possible in their work patterns.On the other hand, enshrining the right to work remotely in a collective agreement will significantly limit the employer's ability to impose return-to-office mandates over the long term. It could also create inequality and competition among those whose jobs can easily be done remotely and those who provide direct services to the public.Multiple issues at playIn addition, there's uncertainty about the long-term impact on the quality of team work, the management and design of government buildings and the psychological impact of isolation on employees. There's a lot more at stake in these negotiations than salary issues.Although the rules have recently been tightened and are still a major focus of the current bargaining process, the government of Canada has shifted significantly when it comes to the role of remote and hybrid work before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.The crisis has irrefutably transformed the workforce in all sectors, and a complete reversal to pre-pandemic work models isn't likely.Even though many political and administrative decisions on remote work loom on the horizon, we argue that workplaces will continue to evolve in the months and years ahead.

  "text": "New research involving the University of Sydney Business School has found researchers underestimate the degree of uncertainty in their findings.          In empirical science, researchers analyze samples to test hypotheses, and this creates a within-researcher variation due to sampling error. Re-sampling yields different values of the estimator, and the standard deviation of this distribution is referred to as standard error.Researchers are less aware, however, that there is an additional level of uncertainty due to there not being a standard analysis path.Researchers vary in what they deem to be the most reasonable path, and estimates may vary across researchers as they might pick different paths. This is referred to a non-standard error.The study, led by Professor Albert Menkveld at the Vrije University of Amsterdam and nine other academics, involved 164 teams testing the same hypotheses on the same data to measure the impact of non-standard errors.A separate team of highly experienced researchers was engaged to peer review the work of each of the 164 teams.The research, scheduled to be published in the Journal of Finance, found that such non-standard errors were substantial and similar in magnitude to standard errors.A relatively straightforward hypothesis about market share produced a non-standard error rate of 1.2%. For a more complex hypothesis about market efficiency, the non-standard error rate was up at 6.7%.Non-standard errors were smaller for better reproducible or higher-rated research, and slashed in half by adding peer-review stage.Study participant Professor Joakim Westerholm from the University of Sydney Business School said the research highlights the importance of researchers taking into account the potential dispersion in estimates when testing hypotheses due to the researchers' choice of analysis path.\"If researchers are not aligned on key decisions, such as selecting a statistical model or treating outliers, their estimates are likely to differ\u2014adding uncertainty to the estimate reported by a single team,\" Professor Westerholm said. \"This type of uncertainty is often underestimated by researchers, which is why we need to be aware of our own bias and the steps we can take to minimize its impact.\"While we cannot expect every question to be investigated by a team of 160 seasoned research teams, we can design approaches that take non-standard errors into account\u2014for example, each member of a team could perform independent tests that are then compared and evaluated.\"Professor Westerholm said the next stage in the research may be to replicate the study using artificial intelligence and machine learning to see whether this has any impact on the rate of non-standard errors.The study is currently available as a working paper in the SSRN Electronic Journal.

  "text": "Alleged misconduct generally reduces public support for political candidates, but many people would still vote for someone accused of sexual harassment, according to a new paper in the journal Electoral Studies from Queen Mary University of London and Brunel University London.          An outsider observing politics would be forgiven for thinking that politics and scandals go hand in hand. Some politicians step down from their roles when accused of misconduct, while others do their best to ride out the storm\u2014but how do allegations of sexual harassment affect voters?Research so far shows that voters tend to punish politicians accused of sexual misconduct, though some maintain party loyalty despite allegations against their candidate. Other studies suggest that voters care less about sexual scandals than corruption. Evidence also highlights the impact of timing; for example, scandals breaking in an election campaign can cause more problems for candidates, and when such news is repeated over time it can intensify the negative effects.New research published today in the journal Electoral Studies has investigated whether people are less likely to vote for a candidate accused of sexual harassment, and how much personal values affect the likelihood of voting for such candidates.The new study involved more than 700 American adults who were eligible to vote in the 2020 US elections. Participants were given basic information about a hypothetical male candidate standing for governor from the participant's favored party, outlining his policy priorities and presenting him as a family man. When asked how likely it was they would vote for him, based on the information they had been given, 90% expressed support for the potential governor.Participants were then randomly assigned to two different groups and given additional information about the candidate. One of the groups was given details of his work with local schools, while the other read media reports of recent sexual harassment allegations by former colleagues which led to the candidate settling a lawsuit. The first group remained supportive and voting intention increased to 94%, while the second group showed a fall in voting intention to 43%.Although the allegations of sexual harassment reduced support overall, the study also revealed that a sizeable minority would still vote for a candidate accused of sexual harassment, with personal values playing a strong role in these outcomes. For example, voters aged 60-69 were more favorable to the accused candidate than those aged 18-30\u2014welcome news for politicians involved in scandals when you consider that older people are more likely to vote.Study author Dr. Sofia Collignon, lecturer in comparative politics at Queen Mary University of London, explained, \"We found that personal values of universalism and benevolence were particularly important. If the voter prioritized the welfare of other people over power and ambition, they were more likely to switch away from the accused candidate.\"Study author Dr. Manu Savani, senior lecturer in behavioral public policy at Brunel University London, continued, \"Individual values guide people in their decision making in all aspects of life, including politics. What we wanted to know was whether this also explained why some voters were more likely than others to punish candidates at the polls if accused of sexual misconduct.\" More information:Manu M.

  "answer_squad": " benevolence",
  "text": "Sustainable diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) transformation requires a committed community who are empowered to openly reflect on their institution's culture, policies and practices. However, the open information-sharing and critical reflection that underlies this type of transformation requires vulnerability\u2014sometimes intense personal vulnerability\u2014and is usually a radical shift from business as usual.          Research suggests that knowledge and information-sharing, culture change and broader institutional innovation are mediated by trust. Therefore, trust should be considered a key element of effective and sustainable DEI transformation. But what is trust?Trust explainedTrust is an important antecedent for authentic connection, willful information-sharing and commitment to culture change and innovation (including for DEI). Scholars, including David Schoorman, Roger Mayer and James Davis, who are deeply involved in trust-related research, argue that trust is defined by integrity, benevolence and ability.Integrity is the trustor's perception that the trustee adheres to a set of principles that the trustor finds acceptable. In other words, it's not enough that trustees act in generally good and reliable ways\u2014they must also follow whatever set of values the trustor adheres to.Benevolence is the extent to which a trustee is believed to want to do good to the trustor, aside from an egocentric profit motive. Meaning, there should be some level of emotional attachment between trustor and trustee, and a belief that the trustee will act in the best interests of the trustor.Ability is the set of skills, competencies and characteristics that enable a party to have influence within some specific domain.Importantly, Schoorman, Mayer and Davis emphasize that trust can be measured by a willingness to take risks. Thus, the level of risk (and therefore the level of trust) in a community might be assessed by the number of people who share sensitive, personal or experiential information with leadership. This type of information sharing is important in organizational trust literature. Some scholars have described trust in a professional setting as the extent to which stakeholders act in ways that suggest they believe they will not be exploited as a result of sharing their knowledge. Connecting this idea to DEI, stakeholders will not invest in risk-taking behaviors, like openly speaking about microaggressions in their department, without trust.In short, trust can be interpreted as a willingness to be vulnerable because of a belief that it's safe to do so\u2014the individual or institution possesses integrity, benevolence and ability. Arguably, trust itself is an equity-issue, given safety as a precursor. This might seem incredibly intuitive, but it's important evidence to have on hand. Resources are available to measure trust, such as validated surveys by Mayer and Mark B. Gavin or N. Gillespie.Given trust is reliant on trustors' perceptions of integrity, benevolence and ability\u2014and the extent to which trustors believe they can act with some level of vulnerability, without negative consequences\u2014connecting with and engaging your community is foundational to promoting information sharing and collaboration. Foster trust in yourself and your institution according to each of the criteria:      IntegrityBelow are three requirements for building integrity:Operate under a shared set of principles. Use community-accepted methods and processes. Maintain transparency in knowledge production, exchange and use.Operate under a shared set of principlesConstructing and complying with agreed-upon principles, commitments or a code of conduct can foster psychological safety, and help trustors' perception that your community shares the same values. If you are in a leadership position, it's helpful to avoid strong advocacy for a particular outcome during this process and, instead, offer compelling evidence to guide your community toward more desirable outcomes. This allows you to be viewed as more neutral (so no group feels slighted), but still promote outcomes that are evidence-based, inclusive and forward-thinking. Furthermore, explore resources for navigating local politics and political sensitivities, particularly when it comes to DEI.Use community accepted methods and processesAdditionally, it's important to use methods of gathering information and generating solutions that are acceptable and accessible to your community. For example, communities that have low levels of trust might value anonymous feedback mechanisms more than identifiable ones, or they might demand that a diverse set of stakeholders with varying identities and levels of power oversee solution generation. This might involve excluding community members with the most power from developing solutions that disproportionately impact community members with the least power.Maintain transparencyAll communities benefit from open and accessible information. Establish shared measurement processes that shift power from a select few to entire communities, clearly and accessibly explain the rationale behind those processes, freely share information and maintain clear quality and control mechanisms. If mistakes or limitations arise, make a strong effort to clearly characterize and mitigate them.BenevolenceThe key to building your community's perception of you, and your institution, as benevolent is explicitly communicating good intention and consistently following-through to carry out the good intention, with positive and tangible results For example, if your community perceives your institution as one that consistently works in the interest of profit, rather than staff or client well-being, you need to make a strong statement to address the concern, establish policies and practices that support staff and client well-being and report back with measurable progress. This idea relates to institutional accountability mechanisms, and collecting valid and reliable data that can be replicated and monitored over time.Unfortunately, for those who want to make quick moves to gain trust from their community members, benevolence may prove to be one of the most notable inhibitors. A major factor for establishing benevolence, and trust in general, is time and emotional acknowledgement. It takes time to build evidence that you are responsive to the interests and needs of your community and to demonstrate that you operate with transparency and accountability when you make a mistake.AbilityEvidence can help garner trust in you and your institution's ability. For example, if your institution has a strong history of championing DEI, you can garner trust by citing successes from past projects, or by sharing promising research conducted by your institution. If you need to build a reputation around your ability to further DEI, consider taking the following actions:Appoint permanent-position leaders who have expertise in DEI and/or experience implementing DEI strategies/roadmaps to actively demonstrate you care about qualified leadership.Engage in long-term professional learning and development in order to build individual capacity and foster community-consensus.Hire external experts to guide your institution and lend credibility and transparency to your approaches.Importantly, there needs to be legitimacy to the advice your institution generates and promotes\u2014ideally informed by experts and crowdsourcing\u2014as well as the methods for handling conversations around sensitive topics. If stakeholders feel they cannot trust your advice, or conversations have been mishandled, you may lose their cooperation. They may turn to others for different, and potentially counterproductive, information, risking the possibility that they become further entrenched in their original beliefs.Maintaining trust through personal accountabilityWhen you lead and engage your community in DEI work, you must be prepared to consistently respond to, and act in, support of your people. Some of the feedback you receive may be hard to hear, or you may even disagree with the feedback entirely. In all instances, the feedback you get must be treated as valid, real and worthy of action.It's also important to resist controlling and/or manipulating the narrative to benefit you or the institution. Pulling from literature about trust repair, you risk losing the trust of your community if you fail to be open and follow up and follow through. Beyond that, you risk exerting your power in unintentional ways (i.e., making decisions that only you and a select group of people under your influence agree with), effectively undermining your own efforts toward a DEI culture. Leaders must be reliable, honest and fair, and keep their promises to their community to build and sustain the trust required to implement and evaluate a DEI transformation. But keep in mind that accountability must go beyond leadership\u2014all institutional stakeholders are accountable for DEI.

When I evaluated existing menstrual leave policies around the world, I found that they were not progressive or beneficial for female reproductive health or gender equality.The thing is, it is really hard to argue against something that sounds good, even if the available evidence suggests otherwise. Humans seem to be bad at going beyond surface thoughts and we may even prefer stories that align with rather than challenge gender stereotypes.So, here is a quick outline of what I think you should know about this policy.What is the problem?There are four main arguments used by those promoting menstrual leave policy:It will make the workplace fit for the menstruating female body.It will improve menstrual health.It will reduce menstrual shame and stigma, and associated discrimination.It will improve gender equality in the workplace and beyond. However, it has never been made clear exactly how the policy will deliver these outcomes. In fact, based on what we know about existing menstrual leave policies, it might not contribute to any of them.For instance, the policy does not make it easier to manage your period at work because your employer doesn't have to change a thing. Instead, you are encouraged to stay away from the workplace.The policy also does nothing to improve menstrual health. The 90% of people who menstruate and do not regularly experience severe symptoms do not need to take a whole day off work during their periods.Meanwhile, the minority who do regularly experience severe symptoms almost always have an underlying health issue, such as endometriosis, heavy menstrual bleeding, polycystic ovary syndrome, fibroids, auto-immune disorders, depression or premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Encouraging people to cope with severe symptoms alone at home every month, is not an effective or humane solution.These health conditions deserve effective and timely medical diagnosis and treatment, sick leave and reasonable workplace adjustments. The same things that apply to all chronic health conditions and are already covered by EU and UK labor policies.Menstrual leave also does not help to reduce menstrual shame, stigma or discrimination. It actually encourages the removal of menstruation\u2014and by extension women\u2014from the public realm by hiding it at home.This sex-based policy conflates healthy periods with debilitating menstrual health conditions, which both pathologises the normal female body and undermines health conditions that mainly affect women. This is partly why women and conditions that mainly affect women are more likely to be dismissed by doctors, sometimes taking years to get a formal diagnosis.Finally, by medicalising the menstrual cycle (that is, positioning it as an illness rather than a healthy process) these policies reinforce sexist beliefs that make it seem like all women are biologically inferior (mentally and physically). This is a major contributing factor in gender discrimination, especially in the workplace, since these ideas are used to undermine the value, contribution and leadership potential of women.      Menstrual leave might even make things worseNot only have existing menstrual leave policies failed to address the problems they set out to solve, they have also directly resulted in discrimination against female workers. This is largely due to the gender myths reinforced by the policy. It makes all women seem like more expensive and less consistent and productive employees. It can also lead to a backlash from colleagues and employers against a sex-based benefit.We already know that shared parental leave (for parents regardless of gender) is a more effective policy than maternity leave (which is female sex-based). It improves the gender pay gap, women's hiring, promotion and leadership opportunities, child health outcomes, fatherhood experiences and gender equality in wider society.These improvements occur because the policy avoids the gender-based backlash associated with maternity leave. This backlash is driven by the conscious or unconscious resentment of, and associated discrimination against, working women due to a perceived unfair advantage (paid time off work) and/or biological liability (the female reproductive body). The same issues apply to menstrual and menopausal health workplace policies.We need to improve workplace (and school, and medical) knowledge of reproductive health and well-being. We should all know what's normal or the sign of an underlying health condition. Likewise, it's shocking that some people do not know why we menstruate or how to reduce cyclical changes.We also need to make workplaces (including schools) fit for those who have periods and to promote more flexible and equitable work cultures and practices that benefit all employees. For instance, challenging \"presenteeism\" if employees feel obliged to work even when feeling unwell, and ditching \"timed\" toilet breaks.While these actions are not quite as simple or catchy as \"menstrual leave,\" they would at least make a positive difference in the lives of millions of workers\u2014without unintentionally worsening gender inequalities.

  "question_squad": " What is the purpose of a balance sheet policy?",
  "answer_squad": " to increase the monetary supply and energize the economy",
  "text": "Central bank balance sheet policies are among the most popular stabilization policy tools but are still poorly understood theoretically and empirically. A new study by Bocconi University, Milan, professors Luigi Iovino and Dmitriy Sergeyev published in The Review of Economic Studies shows that such balance sheet policies are effective if investors behave according to a plausible alternative behavioral assumption to the demanding requirement of rational expectations.          Central bank balance sheet policies include quantitative easing and foreign exchange interventions. They are often pursued by central banks in response to specific economic events. Quantitative easing (QE), for example, is a balance sheet policy in which the central bank purchases financial assets in order to increase the monetary supply and energize the economy and can be pursued with the intent of helping to bring the economy out of a recession.Although balance sheet policies are common, it is unclear whether they are actually effective. Empirically, it is difficult to identify the causal effect of these policies. This is because they are usually implemented in response to a specific event, such as the use of QE in response to a recession\u2014which makes it challenging to disentangle the effects of the policy from the effects of the event that motivated the policy in the first place.Theoretically, a standard class of macroeconomic models predicts balance sheet policies to be in general irrelevant. This is because these models assume investors have rational expectations, which implies they anticipate all future contingencies of any given policy. Under rational expectations, investors correctly forecast how the government and other investors will respond to an intervention.Suppose that a central bank engages the balance sheet intervention of purchasing private risky assets and in exchange creates reserves or sells short-term public bonds. The investor under rational expectations understands that any gains or losses to the central bank's portfolio will eventually be transferred indirectly back to it through taxes.As a result, it is as if the central bank had increased the riskiness of the portfolio of each investor. Investors then respond by reducing their individual demand for risky assets in order to hedge against the new tax risk. But since investors also correctly forecast the actions of other investors, each investor believes every other investor is also going to decrease their total demand for risky assets in a way that exactly compensates the action of the central bank. Thus, each investor anticipates that, following the balance sheet policy, future asset prices will be unaffected. Current asset prices then remain the same and the policy is rendered irrelevant.      The puzzle is that although standard theory predicts this irrelevance, central banks do use balance sheet policies. The new paper by professors Iovino and Sergeyev helps understand this puzzle by demonstrating that under an alternative plausible representation of how investors reason, central bank balance sheet policies are effective. Instead of rational expectations, the authors assume level-k thinking: investors form higher-order beliefs about the behaviors of others only up to some finite level k.While in rational expectations investors forecast the behavior of others perfectly, in level-k thinking different investors can have varying levels of limited sophistication about how they update their beliefs after a balance sheet intervention. Level-1 thinkers observe the intervention but do not update their expectations about future variables affected by the policy, such as taxes. Then, level-2 thinkers do update their expectations about variables affected by the policy but do so under the belief that all other investors are level-1 thinkers: thus the change in belief of level-2 thinkers will not match the change they would have under rational expectations. And so on and so on.Level-k thinking breaks away with the demanding assumption of rational expectations that all people anticipate all future contingencies of a policy change and at the same time allows agents to have varying degrees of sophistication about how they predict the actions of others. The authors find that if we model investors as having such varying degrees of level-k thinking, as opposed to rational expectations, then central bank balance sheet policies are effective. Moreover, Professors Iovino and Sergeyev find empirical support for this model.Beyond this important result which grounds the effectiveness of balance sheet policies, the authors also characterize how the ability of balance sheet policies to stimulate aggregate output depends on the interplay between investors' attitudes toward risk and the risk-return characteristics of the assets involved in the policy. This characterization brings attention to potential unintended consequences of balance sheet policies. In particular, Professor Sergeyev highlights that purchases of long-term public debt may potentially harm aggregate output.

  "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced how often urban residents intersect with people from different income brackets, according to a new study led by MIT researchers.          Examining the movement of people in four U.S. cities before and after the onset of the pandemic, the study found a 15% to 30% decrease in the number of visits residents were making to areas that are socioeconomically different than their own. In turn, this has reduced people's opportunities to interact with others from varied social and economic spheres.\"Income diversity of urban encounters decreased during the pandemic, and not just in the lockdown stages,\" says Takahiro Yabe, a postdoc at the Media Lab and co-author of a newly published paper detailing the study's results. \"It decreased in the long term as well, after mobility patterns recovered.\"Indeed, the study found a large immediate drop-off in urban movement in the spring of 2020, when new policies temporarily shuttered many types of institutions and businesses in the U.S. and much of the world due to the emergence of the deadly COVID-19 virus. But even after such restrictions were lifted and the overall amount of urban movement approached pre-pandemic levels, movement patterns within cities have narrowed; people now visit fewer places.\"We see that changes like working from home, less exploration, more online shopping, all these behaviors add up,\" says Esteban Moro, a research scientist at MIT's Sociotechnical Systems Research Center (SSRC) and another of the paper's co-authors. \"Working from home is amazing and shopping online is great, but we are not seeing each other at the rates we were before.\"The paper, \"Behavioral changes during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased income diversity of urban encounters,\" was published in Nature Communications. The co-authors are Yabe; Bernardo Garc\u00eda Bulle Bueno, a doctoral candidate at MIT's Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS); Xiaowen Dong, an associate professor at Oxford University; Alex Pentland, professor of media arts and sciences at MIT and the Toshiba Professor at the Media Lab; and Moro, who is also an associate professor at the University Carlos III of Madrid.A decline in explorationTo conduct the study, the researchers examined anonymized cellphone data from 1 million users over a three-year period, starting in early 2019, with data focused on four U.S. cities: Boston, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Seattle. The researchers recorded visits to 433,000 specific \"point of interest\" locations in those cities, corroborated in part with records from Infogroup's U.S. Business Database, an annual census of company information.The researchers used U.S. Census Bureau data to categorize the socioeconomic status of the people in the study, placing everyone into one of four income quartiles, based on the average income of the census block (a small area) in which they live. The scholars made the same income-level assessment for every census block in the four cities, then recorded instances in which someone spent from 10 minutes to four hours in a census block other than their own, to see how often people visited areas in different income quartiles.Ultimately, the researchers found that by late 2021, the amount of urban movement overall was returning to pre-pandemic levels, but the scope of places residents were visiting had become more restricted.Among other things, people made many fewer visits to museums, leisure venues, transport sites, and coffee shops. Visits to grocery stores remained fairly constant\u2014but people tend not to leave their socioeconomic circles for grocery shopping.\"Early in the pandemic, people reduced their mobility radius significantly,\" Yabe says. \"By late 2021, that decrease flattened out, and the average dwell time people spent at places other than work and home recovered to pre-pandemic levels. What's different is that exploration substantially decreased, around 5% to 10%. We also see less visitation to fun places.\" He adds, \"Museums are the most diverse places you can find, parks\u2014they took the biggest hit during the pandemic. Places that are [more] segregated, like grocery stores, did not.\"Overall, Moro notes, \"When we explore less, we go to places that are less diverse.\"      Different cities, same patternBecause the study encompassed four cities with different types of policies about reopening public sites and businesses during the pandemic, the researchers could also evaluate what impact public health policies had on urban movement. But even in these different settings, the same phenomenon emerged, with a narrower range of mobility occurring by late 2021.\"Despite the substantial differences in how cities dealt with COVID-19, the decrease in diversity and the behavioral changes were surprisingly similar across the four cities,\" Yabe observes.The researchers emphasize that these changes in urban movement can have long-term societal effects. Prior research has shown a significant association between a diversity of social connections and greater economic success for people in lower-income groups. And while some interactions between people in different income quartiles might be brief and transactional, the evidence suggests that, on aggregate, other more substantial connections have also been reduced. Additionally, the scholars note, the narrowing of experience can also weaken civic ties and valuable political connections.\"It's creating an urban fabric that is actually more brittle, in the sense that we are less exposed to other people,\" Moro says. \"We don't get to know other people in the city, and that is very important for policies and public opinion. We need to convince people that new policies and laws would be fair. And the only way to do that is to know other people's needs. If we don't see them around the city, that will be impossible.\"At the same time, Yabe adds, \"I think there is a lot we can do from a policy standpoint to bring people back to places that used to be a lot more diverse.\" The researchers are currently developing further studies related to cultural and public institutions, as well and transportation issues, to try to evaluate urban connectivity in additional detail.\"The quantity of our mobility has recovered,\" Yabe says. \"The quality has really changed, and we're more segregated as a result.\" More information:Takahiro Yabe et al, Behavioral changes during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased income diversity of urban encounters, Nature Communications (2023).

  "text": "People leave jobs all the time, whether they're laid off, fired, or just quit. But how do their departures affect coworkers left behind? According to a new study from the UBC Sauder School of Business, those exits can lead many others to call it quits.          The researchers delved deeply into employment data from a major retailer that was experiencing high turnover to find out why. They reviewed data for roughly a million employees\u2014including when they were hired, which store, which position, when they left, and why.The study authors also had access to employee performance records, so they could evaluate whether workers were high performers or low performers.\"We looked at these stores as systems, and looked at the flow of employees in and out of them over time,\" explained UBC Sauder assistant professor Sima Sajjadiani (she/her), who co-authored the study with John Kammeyer-Mueller and Alan Benson of the University of Minnesota. \"It gave us a great opportunity to look at the immediate, short-term and long-term effects of each exit event, and compare them over time.\"Past studies have looked at how turnover affects remaining employees, but they typically focus on employee performance after others leave\u2014and on the performance of the company overall. The UBC study is the first of its kind to look at the extent to which employee exits lead to even more departures, what types of exits cause the most churn, and the role that the performance level of exiting employees plays.The researchers found that layoff announcements have a strong and immediate effect, and boost voluntary turnover among those who survive the layoffs.\"It's very bad news for organizations, especially if they are laying off high performers, because if those positions get eliminated, both high and low performers start quitting,\" said Dr. Sajjadiani. \"It's a signal that people's jobs aren't secure, and the organization doesn't care about them, no matter how hard they work. So they think, 'I should leave as soon as possible.'\"When employees quit their jobs voluntarily, their departures give a more moderate boost to voluntary turnover, and it takes longer for that ripple effect to occur.\"To high performers, voluntary exits are a positive signal that there are better opportunities elsewhere,\" said Dr. Sajjadiani. \"So while employees might not leave immediately, they do begin to look for other opportunities.\"When workers are dismissed, however, their departures have a relatively small and fleeting effect\u2014and can even reduce voluntary turnover.\"Usually these are people who are disruptive or abusive, or aren't doing their fair share,\" said Dr. Sajjadiani. \"When they go, high performers tend to stay longer, and the risk of voluntary turnover actually goes down.\"However, when a high performer is dismissed without clear justification, employers not only open themselves to legal headaches, it also sends the wrong message to other high performers. They also start heading for the door.According to Dr. Sajjadiani, organizations vastly underestimate the ripple effects of people leaving and the resulting human capital costs. The research also sends a clear message to organizations that they should be extremely careful when they make exit decisions, or they risk destabilizing the whole organization very quickly.\"Communicating clearly and compassionately, justifying these decisions and trying to avoid the most severe course of actions are better for organizations than simply cutting people,\" Dr. Sajjadiani said.

  "question_squad": " What percentage of women over 16 have experienced physical violence by their partner or ex-partner?",
  "answer_squad": " 11%",
  "text": "In Spain, 11% of women over the age of 16 have experienced physical violence by their partner or ex-partner at some point in their lives. Sexual violence has been suffered by 8.9%, and 31.9% have reported being subjected to psychological violence. An overwhelming percentage of these women (more than 80% in all three categories) say that the episodes happened more than once.          These figures are taken from the 2019 macrosurvey of violence against women, undertaken by the Government of Spain's Ministry of Equality. After going through these experiences, some of these women face another process which can be just as painful: reporting the violence, and going through the legal proceedings.In their study, The Impact of Intimate Partner Violence on Women in Criminal Courts: Beyond the Victim-Survivor Dichotomy, Alazne Aizpitarte, Josep Maria Tamarit-Sumalla, Patricia Hern\u00e1ndez-Hidalgo and Laura Arantegui Arr\u00e0ez, researchers in the Criminal Justice System group (VICRIM) at the UOC (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya), examine how the self-perception of a group of 23 women living in Spain was determined by the experience of suffering from violence inflicted by their partner, and by their interaction with professionals in the justice system.A process that leads to revictimizationThe experience of suffering from violence, fear and intimidation by a partner has a major effect on women's self-perception. As a result, many suffer from contradictory feelings, low self-esteem, and a psychological complexity which makes them clearly vulnerable, this being evident when they report the violence and have to cope with the judicial process.\"It's important to understand that victims of gender violence have emotional baggage when they reach the criminal justice system,\" explained Patricia Hern\u00e1ndez-Hidalgo, a member of the UOC's Faculty of Law and Political Science, a researcher in the VICRIM research group, and a co-author of the study.\"Their experience of this system is not a harmless one for them, because as a result of their particular emotional vulnerability they are at greater risk of being revictimized by the system itself: many of them feel they are judged and questioned by people working in the justice system, they feel they're not believed, they don't understand how the process works or the information they're given, they feel that they have to prove their version of events, and that they have to fit into a profile of a victim who is weak, submissive and passive.\"\"But, at the same time, they're told to confront the issue, end the relationship, be strong and move on.\"As she explains, the justice system plays a crucial role in assigning victimhood to women who report their abusers. \"At this point in the process, the system recognizes that the woman is a victim, and the institutions are generally geared towards guaranteeing their social, employment and economic rights in a paternalistic way.\"Women who go through these processes are often labeled victims or survivors. The concept of a victim is initially linked to adjectives with negative connotations, such as fragile, weak, or dependent, while that of a survivor has more positive connotations, such as empowerment or the ability to take control of their recovery process. However, both concepts act as labels that interfere with the women's recovery process, and are key factors in their experience of the justice system and how they are viewed by society.\"In our study, we found that the dichotomy between a victim and a survivor is insufficient to accommodate the complex casuistry in these situations. What's really interesting and important is to understand that the healing process is personal for each victim, and that what's important is to move on and not to become anchored in the role and label of victim,\" she said.\"That's what we should be offering abused women as a society, without labeling them, without judging them, helping them at their own pace, taking into account their special circumstances and the position that each one of them may have in terms of their situation and their experience.\"      The testimony of 23 womenThe study is based on the experiences of 23 women living in Spain who suffered from violence within their heterosexual relationships and reported what had happened to them. There are significant differences in their accounts as regards how they dealt with the process and their self-perception.The results show the negative psychological impact that interacting with people working in the justice system often had on the victims: \"Many of them said they had felt they were questioned, judged or not listened to,\" the study states. Likewise, there are some issues that are inherent to the judicial process (e.g. those relating to the implications of the presumption of innocence), while others arose from factors that were not legal (such as prejudices arising from the patriarchal view of women as being particularly vulnerable and fragile).According to the researchers, these narratives show the justice system's tendency to reproduce the dynamics of social attribution of the traits of victimization. \"As a society, and as a result of the conceptual framework of Spanish Organic Law 1/2004, the image we have of abused women is of weak, vulnerable, passive women who need special protection. That is epitomized in a vision of the 'good victim,\" who meets society's expectations and who's considered eligible for care services and aid,\" said Hern\u00e1ndez-Hidalgo.\"But what happens when an abused woman doesn't match that profile? What happens when she doesn't look untidy, or worn out, or weak, or dresses well and is carefully made up when she comes to testify in court? Some of the women we interviewed explained to us that, as this description applied to them, their status as a victim was called into question, using phrases such as 'you don't fit the profile of a victim of gender violence.\" These situations are undoubtedly regrettable due to the additional psychological harm they do to these women, and they're a consequence of working on the basis of clich\u00e9s and labels.\"Main conclusionsThe study's main conclusion is that the wide range of experiences cannot be limited to the victim-survivor dichotomy, and that within the criminal justice system the process of labeling based on clich\u00e9s and preconceived ideas about what a 'good victim' should be like and behave like is very influential.Systems based on this reductionist point of view are inadequate and insufficient to respond to the needs of women who have suffered or are suffering from gender violence, and they also increase the risk of secondary victimization.What has been shown to be positive for these women is freeing themselves from their abuser, receiving psychological help, and the passage of time. In most cases, they do not find their experiences during the legal process to be helpful. However, there are some strategies that could help make the justice system more receptive and sensitive to these cases:Providing specialized training for professionals working in the justice system.Creating specific professional services and positions to support, train and prepare these women so that they can deal with the impact of going through the judicial process. Giving them ways to participate actively in the judicial process without feeling overwhelmed, to help them feel able to cope with the situation and reinforce their determination. Applying an approach to sentencing that addresses the harm caused by the offender rather than merely focusing on punishment. \"One way to improve the proceedings would be to move beyond the presumption of vulnerability as regards the female gender, and look at the real situation on a case-by-case basis. We should try to offer a response that is as tailored to each woman as possible, and end the prohibition on criminal mediation, but leaving its application open to cases in which it is possible,\" said Hern\u00e1ndez-Hidalgo.The system could find significant support in the results obtained from academic research in terms of improving this process and responding to the demands of society. It would also be useful to assess the interventions that are carried out, to determine whether the interventions are useful and what aspects need to be changed.\"In short, we need to listen to women who have experienced gender violence to find out first-hand what their needs are, the problems they face and the aspects that can be improved in terms of providing them with care and assistance,\" concluded Hern\u00e1ndez-Hidalgo.The research is published in the journal Victims & Offenders.

  "text": "Most Gen Z young people are characterized as ambitious and forward-thinking, believing all things are possible. But what if you are a teen whose father is, or has been, in prison? How does that affect your outlook on life? How does that affect your optimism in regard to going to college and completing your degree?          University of Notre Dame professors Anna Haskins, the Andrew V. Tackes Associate Professor of Sociology and associate director of Notre Dame's Initiative on Race and Resilience, and Joel Mittleman, assistant professor of sociology, along with the University of Maryland's Wade Jacobsen, used data from the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) to determine how 15-year-old children of incarcerated fathers view their own educational futures.In the study, \"Optimism and Obstacles: Racialized Constraints in College Attitudes and Expectations Among Teens of the Prison Boom,\" recently published in the journal Sociology of Education, the researchers found that although teens with incarcerated fathers were optimistic about their futures and fully committed to the importance of a college degree, they had lower expectations of actually completing college\u2014and this was especially true for impacted Black youth.Of the 3,205 youth who responded to the FFCWS survey, about 60 percent of the teens in the sample who experienced paternal incarceration reported that college graduation is very likely, an additional 37 percent reported it as being somewhat likely and 3 percent said it was unlikely.Their findings, the researchers said, point to the complexity of contemporary teens' college-related attitudes in the wake of the \"prison boom,\" the era of mass incarceration in the United States between 1970 and 2010. This 40-year period has resulted in nearly half of Americans reporting that they have had an immediate family member in prison or jail, including more than 2 million children who currently have an incarcerated parent and 10 million children who have had a parent imprisoned at some point in their lives.Scholars estimate that 1 in 4 Black children, 1 in 10 Latino children and 1 in 25 white children experience parental incarceration by their early teens, the study said. The researchers' work focused primarily on incarcerated fathers because 93 percent of incarcerated parents are men.      \"This research looks at a sample of children that I have followed since they were born,\" Haskins said. \"I have looked at the impact of a father's incarceration on them at age 3, 5, 9 and now 15. We know the effects on them as children, but we wanted to see if\u2014and how\u2014those effects continue. And what we're seeing is that the effects continue to persist into early adulthood.\"Mittleman added that research has already shown that parental incarceration has negative impacts on children's academic performance beginning at a very young age. \"What our study shows is that\u2014even after taking all of those negative impacts into account\u2014the stigma of incarceration itself seems to limit the kind of academic future that Black teens can imagine for themselves,\" he said.Haskins explained that most education research focuses on the tangible consequences of parental incarceration, such as graduation rates and GPAs. \"This study examined the psychosocial measures\u2014in other words, how might parental imprisonment impact the way in which teens see their future,\" she said.\"Because our criminal legal system is so racialized, it's not surprising to find this sort of calibrating downward of one's expectations for oneself,\" Haskins said. \"But this limits [the student's] potential and truncates the educational trajectory for this next generation of young people, without them having done anything wrong. And that's not what we want for them as a society.\"The spillover stigma of familial incarceration can be very stunting for young people,\" Haskins continued. \"And when you think about it, a college education has massive implications for social mobility and later success in life.\"The impacts of the prison boom are long-lasting, Haskins said, and are influencing more consequential educational life decisions. She suggested two things to help reduce that impact: further research and additional resources targeted toward the most impacted populations.\"We need to encourage more research to be done that considers the role of the criminal legal system and how it impacts educational trajectories,\" Haskins said. \"And if we have Black students with an incarcerated parent, then high school or college counselors can do a little more work in trying to shore up other avenues or other types of support that can bolster them, to help them see their educational futures differently.\"This is something Haskins hopes her research\u2014and further research\u2014can do to help encourage the next generation of college-bound students, regardless of what their parents have done or their time spent in prison.\"Our Notre Dame mission of advancing justice and addressing inequality\u2014walking with those that are struggling\u2014is truly important to me,\" Haskins concluded. \"It speaks to families that are touched by the criminal legal system in all of their humanity.\" More information:Anna R.

  "text": "Women and people far from corporate headquarters often need help to get recognition for their ideas. One way to help is to put all ideas on equal footing through a \"blinding\" strategy.          Researchers Linus Dahlander from ESMT Berlin, alongside Arne Thomas, Amsterdam Business School, Martin Wallin, Chalmers University of Technology, and Rebecka \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m, Stockholm School of Economics, wanted to find out if there were biases in how managers evaluate their employees' ideas. They conducted a field experiment in a large multinational technology company where they tested two different ways of evaluating ideas: one where managers did not know anything about the person who came up with the idea (what is known as \"blinding\") and one where they did see the person's name, which unit they worked for, and where they were located.The results were surprising. The researchers found no bias against women and employees who did not work in the same location and unit as the evaluator. The findings are published in the Strategic Management Journal.\"Often, evaluators use the information they know about an idea proposer as a signal for idea quality. This may be reinforced when evaluators lack information, expertise, or resources to assess an idea's details,\" says Dahlander. \"Prior research shows that nepotism and hierarchy, for instance, can impact whether an idea is seen more favorably. Counterintuitively, our new findings clearly show that the gender or a shared unit or location of the evaluator has no impact on whether the idea is approved. It is clear that biases against these groups exist in other places but may not be universal.\"What can companies do in light of these findings? \"Our research tells managers that simply hiding the identity of idea proposers, that is, what we call 'blinding,' is no silver bullet to improving idea evaluation,\" Linus Dahlander explains.To conduct the study, the researchers used a blind evaluation tool, similar to those used in blind recruitment, blind auditions, and blind academic reviews, to remove any potential unconscious biases that evaluators might have. The logic was simple: is an idea evaluated differently when you can see the identity of the person who suggested it, as opposed to when you only see the idea but know nothing about its origin?      The researchers asked 38 innovation managers from a leading multinational company in the information and communication technology sector, all of whom had experience in evaluating early business ideas, to evaluate ideas proposed by other employees. Some ideas were displayed in a blind condition where evaluators were given no information on the idea proposer, while others were displayed in a non-blind condition with information on the employee behind the idea. Each innovation manager evaluated almost 50 different ideas, of which half were blind, and half were not. To ensure that the innovation managers acted candidly in their decision-making, they were unaware that the evaluation task was part of a wider experiment.The researchers found that innovation managers provided the same evaluation score to ideas proposed by men and women, showcasing that the gender of the idea proposer had no impact on whether the innovation manager thought it was a good idea or not. The researchers also found that whether an evaluator shared the same unit and location as the proposer of the idea had no impact on the likelihood of the evaluator approving the idea.The researchers suggest that these findings harm the business case for implementing blinding to erase biases. Although blinding ideas is technically straightforward and relatively cost-neutral to implement, missing out on blocked information can have some opportunity costs. According to the researchers, the flip side of blinding is that it reduces the potential to connect employees with similar interests and learn from what other people are working on.Given that evaluation is not an end goal for companies but one of many steps from an idea to a successful product, the researchers suggest that blinding is most helpful on a smaller scale to determine whether, how, and where biases exist before scaling any idea evaluation initiative within or across organizations. They encourage companies to carefully test and experiment with blinding to figure out how widespread biases are in their organization. Because biases are not as general as we may think, and clearly blinding is not the one-solution to improving idea evaluation. More information:Linus Dahlander et al, Blinded by the person?

  "text": "The Picts of Scotland who have long intrigued and have been ascribed exotic origins in fact descended from indigenous Iron Age society and were genetically most similar to people living today in Scotland, Wales, North Ireland and Northumbria. Adeline Morez of Liverpool John Moores University and Linus Girdland-Flink of the University of Aberdeen report these findings in a new study published April 27 in the journal PLOS Genetics.          The Picts, who inhabited early medieval Scotland from about 300\u2013900 AD, formed the first documented kingdoms of eastern Scotland, but have often been a subject of mystery due to the lack of historical and archaeological evidence and due to their enigmatic symbol tradition inscribed on stone. In their new study, Morez and Girdland-Flink sampled Pictish burials to extract genomes to explore how the Picts are related to other cultural groups in Britain. They sequenced DNA from two individuals from central and northern Scotland that dated from the fifth to the seventh century AD. They compared the resulting high-quality genomes to more than 8,300 previously published ancient and modern genomes.The analysis revealed that Picts descended from local Iron Age populations, who lived across Britain before the arrival of mainland Europeans. Additionally, the researchers found genetic similarities between the Picts and present-day people living in western Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Northumbria. Medieval traditions, including from the time of the Picts themselves, had ascribed exotic origins to the Picts including them coming from Thrace (north of the Aegean Sea), Scythia (eastern Europe), or isles north of Britain, but the new research suggests much less sensational origins.A further analysis of DNA sequenced from seven individuals interred in a Pictish cemetery showed that the individuals did not share a common ancestor on their mother's side. This finding suggests that females may have married outside their own social group and runs counter to older speculation, such as that mentioned by the great English scholar Bede, that the Picts were matrilineal; that they had had a society based on kinship through the mother's lineage.The new findings support current archaeological theories that Picts descended from Iron Age people in Britain. The study also provides novel insights into the genetic relationships that existed among Pictish individuals buried in cemeteries together and between ancient Picts and present-day groups in the United Kingdom.PLOS spoke to Dr. Morez about the research.      What did you choose to investigate in this study, and why?Dr. Morez: In this study, I chose to investigate the genetic ancestry of the Picts\u2014people living in Scotland during the early medieval period (here from individuals buried in eastern and northern Scotland). It has never been done and many historical-based hypotheses stated that they were biologically diverse from their neighbors, with possible ties from the Eurasian steppes.Once we realized they were actually genetically very similar to their contemporaries living in the UK, we decided to push the limit in terms of analytical resolution using imputation of genotypes and analyses based on the autosomal haplotype information (chunks of DNA shared from parents to offspring, modify by mutation and recombination). It allows us to study the fine-scale genetic structure between the Picts and ancient and modern individuals from the UK and Europe.What are the key findings from your research on ancient Pictish genetics?Dr. Morez: The two Picts studied here showed a greater affinity (by haplotype sharing) with present-day populations from western Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Northumbria compared to the populations from southern England, which is important for understanding how present-day diversity formed in the UK.Thanks to comparison with previously published genomes from Pictish people living in the Orkney islands, we could also show that individuals living in the Orkney and in mainland Scotland, likely gathered under the same cultural unit, were slightly divergent likely because of limited gene flow between the two regions and small population size in Orkney, which is known to speed up genetic divergence.What most surprised or interested you about your findings?Dr. Morez: I was surprised to find that the two Pictish genomes from eastern and northern Scotland show a slightly higher but noticeable haplotype sharing with present-day people living in western Scotland, rather than with those from the East where Pictish culture is believed to thrive. This was unexpected and may be caused by several reasons; either we are detecting a population movement from the west of Scotland toward the east but which did not leave a long-lasting genetic signature, or later population movements in the East replaced some of the Pictish ancestry. We still don't know which one is correct.What do you hope your findings might lead to, and what are the next steps for your research?Dr. Morez: I hope the fascination for the Iron Age and medieval period in the UK will increase and lead to more genomes being discovered and analyzed, to get a better understanding of the genetic structure across Scotland. Thanks to these genomes, those already published and the many more yet to come, the UK will soon become the first country where we understand in detail how genetic diversity has formed.Future research will provide new information on the Pictish lifestyle, thanks to archaeologists from the University of Aberdeen and co-authors of the study. Gordon Noble who is reassessing and excavating new Pictish sites, and Kate Britton who investigates dietary habits and mobility using stable isotopes. Linus Girdland Flink (senior author, University of Aberdeen) is coordinating further research on Pictish DNA. This ongoing project will provide an excellent tool to facilitate interdisciplinary research to connect archaeology, archaeological science, history, and human population genetics.

  "answer_squad": " spend more time with a partner",
  "text": "More than half of Americans believe that moving in with a significant other before tying the knot is a good idea\u2014that cohabitation before marriage or even engagement can increase their changes of a happy and successful marriage.          But a new national survey from the University of Denver, published by the Institute for Family Studies, says otherwise.Psychologists and DU psychology professors Galena Rhoades and Scott Stanley say their findings indicate that living together before being engaged can actually decrease a couple's odds of a successful marriage.Rhoades and Stanley used a representative sample of approximately 1,600 Americans who were married for the first time between 2010 and 2019. The study found that 34% of marriages ended among those who lived together before being engaged, while just 23% of marriages ended among couples who waited until after engagement or marriage to move in together.A pattern of resultsThe study's results are in line with similar research Rhoades and Stanley have conducted over the years. One might assume that as societal norms around living together before marriage or engagement have shifted, the statistics on related divorce rates may have also changed. But, Stanley says, that's simply not the case.When people started studying this phenomenon back in the '70s and '80s, it was unusual for couples to live together before marriage, Stanley says. Now that it's more common\u2014with 70% of married couples having lived together first\u2014some sociologists expected that the risk to diminish.But Stanley and Rhoades did not. What they had found in previous studies is that the point at which a couple clarifies their intentions to marry makes a difference.\"That nuance is what's missed, oftentimes,\" Rhoades says. \"The risk is really in living together before the two of you have made a clear and mutual decision\u2014and an announcement, even\u2014to get married.\"Sliding versus decidingIn the current study, Rhoades and Stanley asked survey respondents who cohabited prior to marriage to one of the following descriptions as to why they started living together.\"We didn't think about it or plan it. We slid into it.\"\"We talked about it, but then it just sort of happened.\"\"We talked about it, planned it, and then made a decision together to do it.\"Most people chose option one or two, which Rhoades and Stanley coded as having \"slid\" into living together, while they coded option three as \"deciding\" to live together.They found that those who slid into living together were 13 percentage points more likely to divorce, compared to those who had talked about it and decided beforehand. However, as Rhoades and Stanley note, this difference was cut in half after controlling for other characteristics of the survey participants, suggesting that some of the risk of sliding is due to factors like background characteristics, age at marriage or prior relationship history.This finding, Stanley says, is less robust.\"Getting the sequence right about the timing of moving in together seems to matter more,\" he says.\"Based on this and other research, we do believe that sliding adds to risk and deciding is protective, and that partners should talk openly and clearly about living together\u2014and what it means\u2014beforehand,\" Rhoades says. \"But instead of talking merely about the nuts and bolts of moving in together, many couples need to talk about each partners' expectations and intentions regarding marriage. Where is this relationship heading?\"      Reasons for living togetherAlso important are the reasons people cite for moving in together.Rhoades and Stanley asked respondents to choose one of the four following options as their top reason:\"Made sense financially.\"\"Test the relationship.\"\"Spend more time with partner.\"\"Inconvenient to live apart.\"The most frequently reported top reason for moving in together was to spend more time with a partner. Rhoades and Stanley found that those who listed \"made sense financially\" and \"test the relationship\" as their top reasons were more likely to get divorced than those who reported moving in to spend more time together.\"Identifying the reason why you want to move in together is just as important as identifying the reason why you want to get married,\" Rhoades says.Asking tough questions about why you want to move in together is the best course of action, Stanley says\u2014even if the answers are painful.\"It's obviously not real wise to avoid asking yourself or your partner tough questions from time to time in a relationship,\" he says. \"I mean, one person could be totally sure they want to marry the other, but are they sure that their partner isn't kind of going along for the ride because, 'We're already living together?'\"More cohabiting partners = higher risk of divorceAnother interesting finding from the study is that having a higher number of previous cohabitating partners (i.e., having lived with more romantic partners) is also associated with a higher risk of divorce.Risks associated with having a higher number of cohabitating partners include having a more difficult romantic or family life, more strained economic circumstances, and higher odds of having children with different partners\u2014all of which can increase your odds of divorce.\"More cohabitation experience will often also mean more experience with relationships ending, which can lower barriers to divorce,\" the study says. \"Although no one wants to see a marriage that is dangerous or damaging continue, many couples in marriage struggle at some point, and having a sense that one can easily move on can also mean moving toward the door too quickly in a marriage that might have succeeded with more effort.\"How to mitigate these risksDespite these risks and concerns, Rhoades and Stanley say it's not all doom and gloom. Even couples whose relationships include the aforementioned risk factors can work toward strengthening their relationships and lowering their odds of divorce.\"An earlier study of ours shows that people who lived together without being engaged can lower their risks after they are married,\" Stanley says.\"We know from other research we've done that working on your relationship together or taking a relationship education class ameliorates the risk associated with having lived together before engagement,\" Rhoades says. \"Other studies we've conducted show that people who live together before they got engaged have more conflict and poor communication. Those are skills that people can learn, right? So, if you're married and you lived together before you got engaged, we might suggest that you take a look at your relationship and think about if there are some ways that you could work together to strengthen it.\"And that's part of the work that Rhoades and Stanley do. They don't just study relationships; they use the findings of their research to design programs that can help couples form healthier, stronger relationships.\"One of the reasons this is important, and why we want to study this, is that it's actionable research,\" Rhoades adds. \"This is something that people can make decisions about for themselves, which may impact their futures in really important ways. And I think I can speak for both of us in saying we like doing research that has an impact in that way, and that makes some meaningful contribution to how people live their lives.\" Provided byUniversity of DenverCitation:Study highlights risks of living together before engagement (2023, April 27)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-highlights-engagement.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Models based on the principles of statistical physics can provide useful insights into how languages change through contact between speakers of different languages. In particular, the analysis reveals how unusual linguistic forms are more likely to be replaced by more regular ones over time.          The field of historical linguistics explores how languages change over time, with a particular focus on the evolution of sounds, meanings, and structures in words and sentences. So far, however, it hasn't been widely studied from the viewpoint of statistical physics\u2014which uses mathematical models to explain patterns and behaviors in complex, evolving systems.Through a series of models described in EPJ B, Jean-Marc Luck at Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, together with Anita Mehta at the Clarendon Institute in Oxford, use statistical physics to show how exceptions to well-established grammatical rules are linked to the influence of neighboring languages.According to linguists, languages essentially evolve in two different ways: either through modifications of their roots in more ancient languages, or by borrowing aspects from other modern languages through contact between speakers. In their study, Luck and Mehta drew from the principles of statistical physics to develop a series of mathematical models which allowed them to examine the evolution of word structures more closely\u2014with a particular emphasis on the rules governing verb conjugation.Through 'static' models, the duo expressed the relative numbers of rules and exceptions to grammatical structures in languages; while in their 'dynamic' models, they focused on the emergence of exceptions to these rules.Luck and Mehta's analysis showed how unlikely survivors of these changes are winners against the odds: emerging when the influence of neighboring languages exceeds their tendency towards 'regularization'\u2014where irregular linguistic patterns are replaced by more regular ones over time.In English, for example, past participles like '-ed' added onto the ends of verbs tend to prevail over more unusual linguistic forms, like the '-uck' in 'stuck' or 'struck.' These insights could help linguists to better understand how languages evolve, and even identify aspects of modern languages which are more likely to change in the future.The findings are published in The European Physical Journal B.

  "text": "Allocating land for people to use is one of the most powerful tools a government can have. A newly published study by an MIT scholar now identifies the extent to which state land distribution can be a politically charged act.          The research, focused on Kenya in recent decades, challenges some conventional wisdom while bringing new empirical data to the subject. To explain the \"property rights gap\" in some countries\u2014in which people do not own the land they work on\u2014numerous scholars have concluded that many nation-states are too \"weak,\" and lacking in administrative capacity, to grant extensive rights.This study finds something different: Even supposedly low-capacity states can grant land rights, but they generally choose not to, especially when autocratic leaders are in charge. Instead, property rights are granted more frequently when democratic regimes are in power\u2014though these decisions are made seemingly to bolster electoral support.\"It's clear the state is very able and willing to give out property rights at certain moments in time, when it makes political sense for them,\" says MIT political scientist Mai Hassan, co-author of a new paper detailing the study's findings.\"We found that property rights were much more likely to be given out, and the property rights gap more likely to close, under electoral democracy,\" Hassan adds. \"During autocratic periods, if the property rights gap narrowed at all, the property rights gap was more likely to close only for the autocrats' core supporters in society.\"The paper, \"Closing the Gap: The Politics of Property Rights in Kenya,\" is published in this month's issue of World Politics. The authors are Hassan, an associate professor in MIT's Department of Political Science, and Kathleen Klaus, an associate senior lecturer at Uppsala University in Sweden.Seeking electoral supportAbout one-third of all countries have attempted major land reforms in the last century, and many experts believe full property rights make land use more efficient and spur economic growth. However, scholars estimate that 2 billion people globally still farm land to which they have no formal rights.Researching land rights grew out of ongoing work Hassan and Klaus have each conducted about Kenya for more than a decade.\"You can't understand the Kenyan state without thinking about land and how it is administered, and who owns it, and the rules around ownership and property rights,\" Hassan says.Kenya has had distinct periods of democratic and authoritarian rule since gaining independence from Britain in 1963. Kenya's first president, Jomo Kenyatta, moved the country from a multiparty democracy to an autocracy by 1969; he was followed by Daniel arap Moi, who transitioned back to competitive elections in 1991. Moi was succeeded in 2002 by Mwai Kibaki, who held office via competitive elections from 2002 through 2013.To conduct the research, the scholars used government land-registration documents, census data, and election results, from the early 1960s through 2013. In that time, Kenya has developed 494 land-use \"settlement schemes\" that have located about 279,000 households on government property, covering nearly 10% of the country's arable land.The study pinpoints which subdivided properties were given a particular type of land-registration status in Kenya in a given year, the first major step to allotting individual ownership rights to that property.Overall, Hassan and Klaus found that during democratic periods, 9% of Kenya's settlement schemes were registered for property rights transfers on an annual basis when there was a democratic government, compared to 6% per year when Kenya had an autocratic government.Examining the data further, the scholars found a clear pattern related to the ethnicity of those being granted land. In Kenya, political support is significantly based around ethnic-group identification. Hassan and Klaus found that when Kenya has had an autocrat in power, the chances of land being registered in a given year is 13 percentage points higher when that land is occupied by people of the same ethnicity as the president. But when Kenya has a democracy, the likelihood of land being registered is 15 percentage points higher when the land is occupied by people of a different ethnicity than the president.In short, autocrats seem to be favoring people of their own ethnicity who are often considered their staunchest followers, while elected leaders may be seeking support from people from ethnic groups besides their own.\"Presidents in the lead-up to elections were much more willing to grant property rights for settlement schemes inhabited by swing ethnic groups who weren't decidedly in the opposition, or core members of the president's coalition,\" Hassan observes.      Not weak, just politicalGiven the long-run trends they found, Hassan and Klaus believe we should think differently about the capabilities of the Kenyan government, and can now see its land-use policies in a different light.\"Kenya's leaders were not allocating state resources in a manner that makes sense if their fundamental goal was to pursue economic development by having people procure property rights,\" Hassan says.Instead, the study suggests scholarship on the topic should take into consideration three interlocking points raised by the study, which may apply beyond Kenya's borders as well. One is that the type of regime a country has may matter considerably for its land-use policy. A second is that governments may understand property rights as an especially significant resource they can distribute. Unlike, say, jobs or subsidies, property rights can be harder to revoke, making political calculations about them even more salient.And finally, the state capacity of Kenya, and many other places, may be greater than outsiders have supposed. Failing to distribute property rights may be a matter of choice, not capacity.\"There's this idea that African states or developing countries are weak,\" Hassan says. \"People think it's not fundamentally possible to administer property rights in Africa or the developing world, and that's why you see this property right gap. But even 'weak' states can be utilized by leaders for personal or policy goals.\" More information:Mai Hassan et al, Closing The Gap: The Politics of Property Rights in Kenya, World Politics (2023).

  "text": "Three new Roman fortified camps have been identified across northern Arabia by a remote sensing survey by the University of Oxford's School of Archaeology. Their paper, published in the journal Antiquity, reports the discovery may be evidence of a probable undocumented military campaign across south east Jordan into Saudi Arabia.          The camps were identified using satellite images. According to the research team, they may have been part of a previously undiscovered Roman military campaign linked to the Roman takeover of the Nabataean Kingdom in AD 106 CE, a civilization centered on the world-famous city of Petra, located in Jordan.Dr. Michael Fradley, who led the research and first identified the camps on Google Earth, suggests there is little doubt about the date of the camps. He says, \"We are almost certain they were built by the Roman army, given the typical playing card shape of the enclosures with opposing entrances along each side. The only notable difference between them is that the westernmost camp is significantly larger than the two camps to the east.\"According to Dr. Mike Bishop, an expert on the Roman military, \"These camps are a spectacular new find and an important new insight into Roman campaigning in Arabia. Roman forts and fortresses show how Rome held a province, but temporary camps reveal how they acquired it in the first place.\"The camps would have been built by the army as temporary defended stations when they were marching on campaign. Dr. Fradley adds,\"The level of preservation of the camps is really remarkable, particularly as they may have only been used for a matter of days or weeks\u2026They went along a peripheral caravan route linking Bayir and D\u00fbmat al-Jandal. This suggests a strategy to bypass the more used route down the Wadi Sirhan, adding an element of surprise to the attack. It is amazing that we can see this moment in time played out at a landscape scale.\"Professor Andrew Wilson, a co-author on the paper, says, \"These marching camps\u2014if we are correct in dating them to the early second century\u2014suggest the Roman annexation of the Nabataean Kingdom following the death of the last king, Rabbel II Soter in AD 106, was not an entirely straightforward affair, and that Rome moved quickly to secure the kingdom.\"Given the distance between each camp is 37 km to 44 km, the team speculate it was too far to be crossed by infantry in a day and were instead built by a cavalry unit who could travel over such barren terrain in a single day, possibly on camels.On the basis of the distance between the camps there is also a suggestion that another camp may have been located further west at the later Umayyad fort and well station at Bayir.The newly discovered camps run in a straight line toward D\u00fbmat al-Jandal in what is now Saudi Arabia, but which was then a settlement in the east of the Nabataean kingdom. It suggests Rome had to force its takeover, whereas the surviving Roman history argues the transfer of power was a peaceful event at the end of the reign of the last Nabataean king.Archaeologists still need to confirm the date of the camps through investigation on the ground, but there are other questions that need to be answered. Professor Wilson questions, \"Why does the western camp have twice the capacity of the other two? Did the force split, and if so, where did the other half go? Was it half wiped out in a battle, or did they remain in the western camp to resupply the other camps with water?\"The camps were identified by the Endangered Archaeology in the Middle East and North Africa project (EAMENA), and were later photographed by the Aerial Archaeology in Jordan project (APAAME).

  "answer_squad": " The Perceptions of Research Trustworthiness",
  "text": "A Vanderbilt University Medical Center-led team has developed a scale to measure trustworthiness in biomedical research among minority populations\u2014a landmark tool for researchers to use to improve their own trustworthiness, and thus participation in research.          The Perceptions of Research Trustworthiness (PoRT), described in an original investigation published in JAMA Network Open, is a groundbreaking tool designed as an on-going gauge of perception of trust and distrust in biomedical research, said team leader Consuelo H. Wilkins, MD, MSCI, Senior Vice President and senior associate dean for Health Equity and Inclusive Excellence and professor of Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC).By focusing on the trustworthiness of research and the investigators, the burden of 'trust' is moved from the participant to the researcher\u2014a rebalancing of the historical approach to trust in science, Wilkins said.Usually, the onus of trusting the process is placed on the participant, who is perceived to have at least a latent trust in science.However, the culture and experiences of historically marginalized and minoritized racial and ethnic groups foster a deep-rooted distrust of science and biomedical research. Wilkins is ardently pushing for the research institution to take on the burden of being trustworthy\u2014and measuring their success in earning and maintaining trust.\"The critical message of this validation of PoRT is about how are we as researchers being trustworthy? So often we put the burden on the research volunteer, the patient, the community to be trusting of us. We're not asking, 'Are we worthy of their trust?' They have valid reasons to not trust researchers and institutions. We have to change how we communicate and act with cultural humility and acknowledge past exploitations while clearly illustrating the benefit of participating in their community and society. The hard work of 'trust' is on us,\" Wilkins said.The research team wants PoRT to be used in projects across the country to measure and understand how trust influences outcomes, especially behaviors and willingness to participate.\"This is a process; the work is ongoing because you have to peel back the layers to identify what is fueling trust or distrust in individual populations. We tend to place all minority and marginalized groups in one bucket when it comes to understanding the rationale for trust and mistrust. However, one of our studies shows that Black Americans had lower levels of trust in biomedical research compared to White Americans, and factors contributing to differing trust levels varied by group. This points to the need for tailored or targeted strategies in approaching different populations to improve trust in the biomedical research processes,\" said Jennifer Cunningham-Erves, Ph.D., MPH, associate professor in Meharry Medical College's Department of Internal Medicine.The development and validation of PoRT took many years. Yet, being able to measure and gauge trustworthiness is vital to recruiting study participants who are representative of the population. This tool is a way for researchers to put commitments to equitable studies into action by actively improving themselves before launching the study.\"The journey to measure abstract concepts such as 'trustworthiness,' along with the multidimensional relationship between 'trust' and 'distrust' is exciting and challenging. We've had confidence that researchers can behave in a more trustworthy manner even as people along the way said it can't be proved or reliably measured. I found that emboldening,\" said Sarah Stallings, Ph.D., research assistant professor in the genetic medicine division at VUMC. More information:Sarah C.

  "text": "Ukraine is facing a depopulation crisis that was being felt by ordinary Ukrainians even before the Russian invasion, according to new research by the University of Southampton.          Researchers are now calling on policy makers to support Ukrainians with jobs, housing, and policies to help them start families to help stop spiraling depopulation.Ukraine has one of the highest rates of population decrease in Europe. Its population has been steadily declining since 1993 and this was exacerbated by the annexation of Crimea in 2014, the rebellion by pro-Russian separatists in the east, and the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2021, Ukraine's population had shrunk by over 10 million people in 20 years.\"Before the Russian invasion, Ukraine was already facing a triple burden of depopulation\u2014low fertility, high mortality and substantial emigration,\" says Professor Brienna Perelli-Harris from the Centre for Population Change at the University of Southampton.\"The Russian invasion has accelerated this decline in ways we could scarcely have imagined when we conducted our research just six months earlier.\"To understand how Ukrainians were experiencing this depopulation, researchers conducted online focus groups in several locations in eastern Ukraine: rural villages; Mariupol, which was then receiving internally displaced people; the large city of Kharkiv; and Donetsk, held by Russian-backed separatists.'Bleak' rural villagesThe 'triple burden' was particularly apparent in rural areas. According to the participants, a lack of job opportunities, the degradation of infrastructure, and limited public transport had resulted in more and more people, especially young people, leaving villages.Credit: University of Southampton'Thriving' Mariupol and KharkivAt the time of the study, the cities of Mariupol and Kharkiv were growing due to people coming from surrounding villages and an influx of internally displaced people who had arrived from eastern Ukraine after 2014.Most participants in Kharkiv and Mariupol acknowledged the benefits of specialists and experts coming to their cities, but some were concerned about straining infrastructure and resources.Professor Perelli-Harris says, \"It's horrific that cities which our focus groups described as vibrant, bustling, and optimistic about their future have been devastated by war with Russia. Places which had been safe havens for people displaced by conflict have now found themselves in a warzone.\"      'Empty' DonetskDonetsk experienced armed conflict in 2014, followed by a massive outflow of people in subsequent years. Residents spoke of empty apartments, deserted neighborhoods, and eerily quiet streets. The 10pm curfew, which had been in effect since the start of the war, stifled any evening activity or nightlife.The study says that even before the Russian invasion, depopulation was having dire consequences for Ukraine, leading to a shrinking labor force, severe aging, and a general lack of development.\"People in the areas we studied have now been displaced, made destitute, detained, forcibly deported, conscripted into the Russian army, or worse,\" says Professor Perelli-Harris. \"Looking to a post-war future, policymakers across the world must recognize the issue of depopulation in Ukraine, and provide support to its people in rebuilding, regenerating, and stopping the spiral of depopulation. In the short-term, Ukrainians should be supported with jobs, housing, and policies to help them start families.\"The study, \"The triple burden of depopulation in Ukraine: examining perceptions of population decline,\" has been published in Vienna Yearbook of Population Research.

  "text": "Research from experts at City, University of London's Department of Sociology and Criminology suggests that although women students feel largely safe while on campus, universities have a responsibility that extends beyond campus and encompasses surrounding areas and commuter routes into and out of study areas.          The research, captured the lived experiences of 24 women students at City across a two-week period using a chatbot app, City Life, which was developed for the purposes of the study. The project concluded with a series of semi-structured interviews.City Life recorded lived experiences both during and outside of university contact hours with the aim of gaining a more situated understanding of fear. Students were given the opportunity to chart their emotions while traveling in and out of university, moving around campus and socializing.Key findings from the study include:For women students, the experience of fear is closely associated with mobility on campus (in effect, moving between buildings). This fear was more pronounced at darker times of day and when there was little company. Women students experienced more fear while moving through the wider environment outside of campus. Accordingly, non-campus universities are significant here, as students have greater distances to travel between buildings and locations, as well as more complex public transport routes. Public transport and the sharing of enclosed spaces was also a major factor in students' encountering of fear. Students frequently carry expensive equipment, including laptops, phones and tablets on their person. This generally exacerbated the fear felt by some participants of the study when traveling to and from university. City Life made participants more cognisant of their surroundings and how they experienced these surroundings\u2014a sense one participant described as \"safety in knowledge\".The study was led by Dr. Michael Saker, Senior Lecturer in Digital Sociology and Societal Change with Dan Mercea, Professor of Digital and Social Change and Dr. Carrie-Anne Myers, Reader in Criminology at City.Having successfully gathered data and established the feasibility of the chatbot app, the researchers now plan to build a more sophisticated, upscaled system with the aim of rolling out to other institutions and a far wider pool of students.Dr. Saker said he hoped the feasibility of the study would help upscale the operation and further develop City Life to better comprehend fear of crime, and that this comprehension could be parlayed into more suitable policy.\"High-profile incidents in the news have highlighted the fear many women and women students encounter in their everyday lives,\" he said.\"Previous research indeed tells us that it prompts them to avoid certain areas and activities which directly and indirectly evoking emotions of fear\u2014such as forgoing evening classes and social activities in favor of traveling home during sociable or lighter hours.\"\"Our study shows the feasibility of exploring situations of fear using technology such as an app. The next step is to develop our system further and grow it into a more enhanced tool for wider engagement and awareness.\"Professor Mercea commented that the report could help universities understand and mitigate the triggers of fear to improve overall student experience.\"Students generally carry expensive possessions\u2014laptops, tablets, phones\u2014on their person, while being focused within an area of space. Carrying such items around can evoke a level of fear in itself.\"\"Although our pilot shows that City's campus is widely regarded as a safe place, universities must reognize the external triggers in their institutional designs and safeguarding initiatives. Doing so will help them provide a more inclusive experience where students can take part in extracurricular activities without the fear of experiencing crime.\"Dr. Myers said a study of this kind was highly topical to current trends in higher education.\"The post-Covid environment means students are returning to campus, while a cost of living crisis is forcing many to commute longer distances to their university.\"\"This increases the likelihood of encountering 'off-campus' fear, such as on train journeys and walking to and from terminals.\"\"Providing students with the means to report feelings of fear\u2014as our chatbot app did\u2014creates the opportunity for institutions and local authorities to form a situated understanding of what students see as safer environments.\"      About the studyCity Life is a chatbot app developed by the research team using the FlowXO chatbot software, and distributed using Telegram.Twenty-four participants used the app over a two-week period, completing eight tasks that pertained to university life and their relationships with the emotion of fear. Participants were women aged between 18 and 40, with a mean age of 25.

  "text": "In a review of more than three decades' worth of studies that examine support for, or opposition to, policies with racial equity implications, a Cornell-led research group found that more research on messaging that includes the voices of historically marginalized people is necessary in the push toward equity.          \"It is quite striking, given that these are messages about racial equity, but most of the studies are about what white people think about these issues,\" said Jeff Niederdeppe, professorof communication and public policy in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) and senior associate dean of faculty development in the Cornell Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy. \"Ironically, this research on racial equity centers the perspectives of white people.\"Niederdeppe is corresponding author of \"Strategic Messaging to Promote Policies that Advance Racial Equity: What Do We Know, And What Do We Need to Learn?\" published April 25 in Milbank Quarterly.Co-authors include Neil Lewis Jr. '13, assistant professor of communication (CALS) and co-director of the Action Research Collaborative in CALS and the College of Human Ecology; Jiawei Liu, postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Communication (CALS); and Mikaela Spruill, doctoral candidate in social psychology.This research\u2014initiated in the summer of 2019\u2014was informed by an observation Niederdeppe, Lewis and their collaborators noticed in how research about racial equity-related issues were being communicated by scientists and more broadly being discussed in public discourse. There were bold claims regarding the discussion of race and racial equity that were based on single studies, which nonetheless garnered a lot of media attention.\"There are lots of statements and messages about advancing racial equity,\" Lewis said. \"Especially over the past two to three years, there's been a lot of, 'This is what we should say, this is what we shouldn't say,' and so on. We've seen these messages a lot. But it's worth taking a moment to ask, 'What do these messages do? Are they helpful, or do they just make us feel good for saying them?'\"Niederdeppe and his team\u2014including researchers from Wesleyan University and the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, part of the Collaborative on Media and Messaging (COMM)\u2014analyzed 55 papers reporting on 80 different studies, published between January 1990 and April 2021, that tested the effects of one or more message strategies in shaping support for racial equity-related policies.      The messaging strategies featured in each study were put into one (or more, if relevant) of the following categories:racial cues (brief messaging identifying the race of the people involved in an issue);racial stereotypes (messaging that includes race-related stereotype information);non-racial cues (messages that could invite racial connotations but that do not explicitly mention race);social comparison frames (messages that explicitly compare social conditions and/or outcomes between racial groups);causal frames (messages that include statements about the root cause of racial inequity);responsibility frames (messages focusing on who is responsible for addressing a particular social issue);diversity frames (messages describing the value of diversity); andstrategy frames (lengthier messages that depict policymaking as a strategic move to win votes).Of the studies analyzed, 45% featured messaging strategies that employed racial cues; social comparison framing was featured in 24%. Most studies (91%) analyzed short-form messaging, and all were cross-sectional (i.e. in the moment, not studying the effects of messages over time).One overarching finding: Brief cues that signal the Black identity of victim(s) or perpetrator(s) in the context of a social problem, in the absence of a broader contextual discussion of the causes of social issues, can undermine support for racial equity-promoting policies among white respondents. However, very few studies explore how these broader contextual discussions can move people toward greater support for racial equity, and several studies suggest that this is indeed possible.Another takeaway for Niederdeppe and Lewis: It's not just an issue of Black and white, yet that's what most of the studies are about.\"The nation and broader world are much more complex than that,\" Lewis said. \"We don't study as much how race intersects with things like gender, sexuality and many other factors that we know impact people's lives and experiences. We need to move forward with studying some of those complexities, if we really want to have a better understanding of how these things are going to work in real life.\"There's no one-size-fits-all answer, Niederdeppe said, and researchers must examine this issue with a sense of humility.\"There are different kinds of policies to talk about, different audiences, different political landscapes,\" he said. \"There's no checklist\u2014'You do this, and you will magically achieve your communication outcome.' It's a moving target; that's part of the humility. Even if we studied this really well, we're going to have to continue to learn and evolve and respond.\"The authors concluded with a call to action: \"The time has arrived to invest the effort and resources to develop, test and disseminate communication interventions that advance racial equity through policy advocacy, community mobilization and collective action.\" More information:Jeff Niederdeppe et al, Strategic Messaging to Promote Policies that Advance Racial Equity: What Do We Know, and What Do We Need to Learn?, The Milbank Quarterly (2023).

Landmark research published in Nature Communications by mathematicians Dr. Robyn Araujo at QUT and Professor Lance Liotta of George Mason University in the U.S. sets out the definitive picture of biological adaptation at the level of intermolecular interactions.Dr. Araujo, from the QUT School of Mathematical Sciences, said the research findings represented a blueprint for adaptation-capable signaling networks across all domains of life and for the design of synthetic biosystems.\"Our study considers a process called robust perfect adaptation (RPA) whereby biological systems, from individual cells to entire organisms, maintain important molecules within narrow concentration ranges despite continually being bombarded with disturbances to the system,\" Dr. Araujo said.\"Until now, no one had a general way to explain how this vital process was orchestrated at the molecular level through the vast, complex, often highly intricate networks of chemical reactions among different types of molecules, mostly proteins.\"We have now solved this problem, having discovered fundamental molecular-level design principles that organize all forms of biological complexity into robustness-promoting, and ultimately, survival-promoting, chemical reaction structures.\"Dr. Araujo said they had found that collections of interacting molecules in living systems cannot simply \"transmit\" biochemical signals but must actually make \"computations\" on these signals.\"These complex intermolecular interactions must implement a special type of regulation known as integral control\u2014a design strategy known to engineers for almost a century.\"However, signaling networks in nature are vastly different, having evolved to rely on the physical interactions between discrete molecules. So, nature's 'solutions' operate through remarkable and highly intricate collections of interactions, without engineering's specially designed, integral-computing components, and often without feedback loops.\"We show that molecular network structures use a form of integral control in which multiple independent integrals, each with a very special and simple structure, can collaborate to confer the capacity for adaptation on specific molecules.\"Using an algebraic algorithm based on this finding, we have been able to demonstrate the existence of embedded integrals in biologically important chemical reaction networks whose ability to exhibit adaptation could never before be explained by any systematic method.\"Professor Liotta said the quest to uncover the fundamental design principles of biological systems throughout nature is considered to be one of the most important and far-reaching grand challenges in the life sciences.\"On the basis of this ground-breaking new research, RPA currently stands alone as a keystone biological response for which there now exists a universal explanatory framework.\"It's a framework that imposes strict and inviolable design criteria on arbitrarily large and complex networks, and one that now accounts for the subtleties of intricate intermolecular interactions at the network microscale.\"At a practical level, this discovery could provide a completely fresh approach to tackle grand challenges in personalized medicine such as cancer drug resistance, addiction, and autoimmune diseases.\" More information:Robyn P.

  "text": "The momentum brought to Cornish learning during the pandemic needs to be used as a springboard to encourage more people to take up the language, an expert has said.          Online courses and materials boosted efforts to keep Cornish alive, and this energy must not be allowed to disappear, according to Kensa Broadhurst, from the University of Exeter.She has said the switch to online learning should be used to create new online and in-person activities and to bring together both new and existing speakers of the language.In a new study Ms Broadhurst outlines how lockdowns benefitted the teaching of the Cornish language. Although Cornish teaching provision had been available outside Cornwall prior to this date, during the pandemic widespread access to the teachers based in Cornwall and elsewhere was now available to people anywhere in the world. As classes initially moved online it became apparent that there was a demand for them for students from outside Cornwall.The research, published in the Proceedings of the Harvard Celtic Colloquium, also shows the challenges which exist to keep Cornish language learning alive. It warns offering Cornish in secondary schools would require a vast increase in resources and teacher training, both of which currently rely heavily on the voluntary sector within Cornish adult education. For Cornish to succeed at primary level, it needs both the support of headteachers and a teacher who is able either to speak Cornish, or to run the sessions.Ms Broadhurst said, \"For Cornish to succeed within the state education system, it requires status, a place within the school day, properly resourced and paid peripatetic teachers, or resources and retraining for existing teachers within schools. For Cornish to be attractive to both students and teachers at a secondary level it needs to have a purpose beyond the classroom. This could include creating opportunities either for examination success or for further use beyond secondary education\u2013 within higher education or the workplace.\"      \"As yet, Cornish does not have enough of a stronghold within the primary system in Cornwall either within curriculum time, or as part of a club, due to inadequate manpower provision. However, if school staff become more willing and confident to deliver the language, and less reliant on outside providers, uptake should continue to grow. A key marker of the success of Cornish in primary schools will be the acceptance of Cornish as a modern or ancient foreign language.\"The study cites survey data showing in 2021 there were 217 Cornish language learners\u201485 beginners and 65 intermediate. There were fifty-four students at a high level and twenty-three students were fluent speakers who continue to attend classes. A similar survey in 2014 reported forty-four beginners and thirty intermediate students.Ms Broadhurst said, \"The year 2020 witnessed a concerted effort to support those teaching Cornish within adult education, both by providing training, especially in online teaching and through the production of high-quality, modern resources which have been made freely available. The modernization of Cornish language teaching and teaching resources could serve to break this negative cycle of expectation.\"Efforts are currently underway to modernize and professionalize the teaching of Cornish in adult education, to increase the availability of the language at the pre-school level, and to provide some availability at primary level. The language movement now needs to consider what benefits it can offer to secondary, further, and higher education. A new GCSE might be possible, which in turn could lead to A Level provision. However, the availability of teachers capable of teaching at these levels and the quality of educational resources remains one of the biggest problems. Remedying this would necessitate the provision of a training programs for teachers and a wide variety of language materials.\"Through seeking to provide as diverse a range of education, and educational materials, it should be possible to preserve the language as a living being, fit for purpose in everyday situations and to better reflect the purposes for which it was originally used. None of these issues will be resolved overnight.\" More information:'Cronnack an hager dhu' Sign of a flourishing language?

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the book that Fox and others have written about serial killers?",
  "answer_squad": " Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder",
  "text": "Looking at the most-streamed movies or television shows on any given streaming service, it would be easy to assume that serial killers lurk behind every corner. The stories of Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Bundy and the Boston Strangler still loom large\u2013\u2013even if the likelihood that you'll encounter another Zodiac Killer has never been lower.          Since the 1970s and 1980s, a high activity period for serial murderers, the numbers have dropped significantly. Numbers peaked in the 1970s when there were nearly 300 known active serial killers in the U.S. In the 1980s, there were more than 250 active killers who accounted for between 120 and 180 deaths per year. By the time the 2010s rolled around there were fewer than 50 known active killers.This data is based on numbers from the Radford University/Florida Gulf Coast University Serial Killer Database that have been further analyzed, combed through and published in the recently-updated \"Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder\" by James Alan Fox, Jack Levin, Emma Fridel.But what accounts for this dramatic decrease over the last 40 years?According to Fox, a criminology professor at Northeastern University, it comes down to several major changes in forensic science, policing, criminal justice and technology that have made it harder than ever for the BTK Killers of the world to escape capture.The decline that started in the 1980s mirrors a decrease in a nationwide crackdown on crime that occurred in the 1980s and 1990s made it difficult for serial killers, let alone anyone involved in violent crime, to stay out of prison.\"Part of it has to do with the same reason the murder rate has gone down,\" Fox says. \"You have a surging number of people behind bars, so some of the would-be serial killers were likely behind bars as opposed to in the bars looking for victims.\"Between 1980 and 1992, the incarceration rate in federal and state prisons more than doubled to 332 per 100,000 U.S. residents, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.Advances in forensic science and DNA testing have also made it possible for police to more effectively investigate murders, even those that have remained open or questionable for decades.\"The first case I was involved with in 1990, I was on a task force investigating the murders of five college students,\" Fox says. \"We had DNA, but it was pretty crude. We couldn't get DNA from hair\u2013\u2013now you can. You needed a lot of genetic material to be able to identify the DNA pattern\u2013\u2013now you don't.\"                Credit: Northeastern University             Forensic genealogy, recently used in the case of suspected quadruple murderer Bryan Kohlberger, has even made it possible to test DNA collected at a crime scene against DNA collected from a suspect's family.And serial killers can leave a digital fingerprint too. Fox says the proliferation of surveillance cameras and the advent of the cellphone with its GPS tracking capabilities have made it harder for serial killers to abduct their victims in the first place. Investigators also have even more tools at their disposal to track a killer's whereabouts, whether it's an IP address or, in the case of the BTK Killer, the metadata off of a floppy disk.Fox also attributes the decrease in serial killers to changing behaviors among the public as well. With widespread social and cultural changes in the 60s and 70s\u2013\u2013drug use, hitchhiking, the hippie movement, anti-establishment sentiment\u2013\u2013conditions were prime for predators to go on the prowl, Fox says.But things have changed in the last few decades. Fears around mass killings have increased, as has the public's general anxiety and distrust for one another. People are \"much more aware and cautious than we used to be\" and might be less likely to accept help from a stranger who says they just want to help you fix your flat tire.Changes in how parents think about their children's safety also mean some of the most common targets for serial killers, young women and girls, are less vulnerable than in decades past. According to Fox, Levin and Fridel, of the 5,582 victims killed by serial killers since 1970, more than half are female. About 30.2% of those female victims are between the ages of 20 and 29 and 23% are between the ages of 5 and 19.Laurie Kramer, a professor of applied psychology at Northeastern, says many parents now feel like the world is a \"more dangerous and risky\" place, even at school, places they previously assumed were \"risk free.\"\"There is that sense that parents need to be much more participatory and intentional about selecting those opportunities in which their kids are going to be beyond school and church or other sorts of things that are pretty normative for them,\" Kramer says. \"There's just a general anxiety, and I think that plays out with being protective.\"Kramer also speculates that the shift toward social emotional learning that occurred in school systems across the country over the last decade could partly explain why there are fewer serial killers now. SEL helps students develop empathy and manage their frustration and anger, while also giving educators a chance to \"compensate for some trauma that kids may have experienced in other settings, like their homes,\" Kramer says. Although it's not a guaranteed fix, that extra layer of support could help prevent potential serial killers from developing in the first place.\"By having some ability to identify individuals early in life who are having difficulty, to provide appropriate forms of intervention and treatment earlier and to provide more effective forms of treatment, all of this is improving,\" Kramer says.Even though there are fewer serial killers stalking American streets, the culture at large remains fascinated by the horrific, sordid tales of who Fox calls \"the legacy killers.\" Serial killers may have an oversized cultural presence given how unlikely it is for people to encounter them, but Fox says it is still vitally important to study and, hopefully, prevent them from killing.\"The Boston Strangler killed 13 people and impacted their loved ones, but also was able to hold this entire city in a grip of terror for years,\" Fox says. \"The idea that there was one person who wreaked so much havoc on the city, whatever we can do to understand and prevent and capture someone like that early on, the better off we are.\" Provided byNortheastern UniversityCitation:Why are there fewer serial killers now than there used to be?

  "answer_squad": " huge uncertainty around the future trajectory of AI technology",
  "text": "On November 30 2022, OpenAI launched the AI chatbot ChatGTP, making the latest generation of AI technologies widely available. In the few months since then, we have seen Italy ban ChatGTP over privacy concerns, leading technology luminaries calling for a pause on AI systems development, and even prominent researchers saying we should be prepared to launch airstrikes on data centres associated with rogue AI.          The rapid deployment of AI and its potential impacts on human society and economies is now clearly in the spotlight.What will AI mean for productivity and economic growth? Will it usher in an age of automated luxury for all, or simply intensify existing inequalities? And what does it mean for the role of humans?Economists have been studying these questions for many years. My colleague Yixiao Zhou and I surveyed their results in 2021, and found we are still a long way from definitive answers.The big economic pictureOver the past half-century or so, workers around the world have been getting a smaller fraction of their country's total income.At the same time, growth in productivity\u2014how much output can be produced with a given amount of inputs such as labour and materials\u2014has slowed down. This period has also seen huge developments in the creation and implementation of information technologies and automation.Better technology is supposed to increase productivity. The apparent failure of the computer revolution to deliver these gains is a puzzle economists call the Solow paradox.Will AI rescue global productivity from its long slump? And if so, who will reap the gains? Many people are curious about these questions.While consulting firms have often painted AI as an economic panacea, policymakers are more concerned about potential job losses. Economists, perhaps unsurprisingly, take a more cautious view.Radical change at a rapid pacePerhaps the single greatest source of caution is the huge uncertainty around the future trajectory of AI technology.Compared to previous technological leaps\u2014such as railways, motorised transport and, more recently, the gradual integration of computers into all aspects of our lives\u2014AI can spread much faster. And it can do this with much lower capital investment.This is because the application of AI is largely a revolution in software. Much of the infrastructure it requires, such as computing devices, networks and cloud services, is already in place. There is no need for the slow process of building out a physical railway or broadband network\u2014you can use ChatGPT and the rapidly proliferating horde of similar software right now from your phone.It is also relatively cheap to make use of AI, which greatly decreases the barriers to entry. This links to another major uncertainty around AI: the scope and domain of the impacts.AI seems likely to radically change the way we do things in many areas, from education and privacy to the structure of global trade. AI may not just change discrete elements of the economy but rather its broader structure.Adequate modelling of such complex and radical change would be challenging in the extreme, and nobody has yet done it. Yet without such modelling, economists cannot provide clear statements about likely impacts on the economy overall.      More inequality, weaker institutionsAlthough economists have different opinions on the impact of AI, there is general agreement among economic studies that AI will increase inequality.One possible example of this could be a further shift in the advantage from labour to capital, weakening labour institutions along the way. At the same time, it may also reduce tax bases, weakening the government's capacity for redistribution.Most empirical studies find that AI technology will not reduce overall employment. However, it is likely to reduce the relative amount of income going to low-skilled labour, which will increase inequality across society.Moreover, AI-induced productivity growth would cause employment redistribution and trade restructuring, which would tend to further increase inequality both within countries and between them.As a consequence, controlling the rate at which AI technology is adopted is likely to slow down the pace of societal and economic restructuring. This will provide a longer window for adjustment between relative losers and beneficiaries.In the face of the rise of robotics and AI, there is possibility for governments to alleviate income inequality and its negative impacts with policies that aim to reduce inequality of opportunity.What's left for humans?The famous economist Jeffrey Sachs once said,  What humans can do in the AI era is just to be human beings, because this is what robots or AI cannot do.But what does that mean, exactly? At least in economic terms?In traditional economic modelling, humans are often synonymous with \"labour\", and also being an optimising agent at the same time. If machines can not only perform labour, but also make decisions and even create ideas, what's left for humans?The rise of AI challenges economists to develop more complex representations of humans and the \"economic agents\" which inhabit their models.As American economists David Parkes and Michael Wellman have noted, a world of AI agents may actually behave more like economic theory than the human world does. Compared to humans, AIs \"better respect idealised assumptions of rationality than people, interacting through novel rules and incentive systems quite distinct from those tailored for people\".Importantly, having a better concept of what is \"human\" in economics should also help us think through what new characteristics AI will bring into an economy.Will AI bring us some kind of fundamentally new production technology, or will it tinker with existing production technologies? Is AI simply a substitute for labour or human capital, or is it an independent economic agent in the economic system?Answering these questions is vital for economists\u2014and for understanding how the world will change in the coming years.

  "text": "A George Washington University study offers new insights into why human cultures become more complex over time. The study finds that people combine and generalize socially acquired knowledge over time, resulting in new and more complex knowledge. The ability to combine and generalize socially learned knowledge appears to occur prior to formal schooling and may represent a unique feature of human intelligence called generative cultural learning.          The article, \"Generative Cultural Learning in Children and Adults: The role of compositionality and generativity in cultural evolution,\" was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B on April 26, 2023.A team from GW's Social Cognition Lab, led by associate professor Francys Subiaul, assigned preschool-age children and college-age adults to build a tower by stacking two cubes, linking two flat squares, and then combining the two components. In a previous study, none of the preschool-age children and only 5% of adults provided with cubes and squares had produced the optimal tower on their own. However, after observing a model stack cubes and another model link squares, over 40% of children and 75% of adults imitated the demonstrated actions and built an optimal tower.The current study replicated the methods used in the previous study, but provided participants with twice as many cubes and squares. Not only did the participants use the social knowledge provided and extend it to the new exercise, they also spontaneously combined these two newly developed responses with additional cubes and squares to form one new, extra-tall tower. Although adults were better at the task overall, both children and adults learned at equivalent rates and made similar errors.\"The similarity of performance between children and adults, despite the wide gulf in experience, offers powerful evidence that these skills are neither learned in school nor explicitly taught by caretakers,\" Subiaul said. \"Instead, this mode of social learning involving the combination and generalization of social knowledge appears to be done by default. These results provide compelling evidence as to why only human cultures evolve and become increasingly complex over time.\"The research team consisted of Subiaul, Columbia University graduate student Adrian Varallyay, and GW undergraduate student Nathalia Beller.

The researchers, including Jonathan Homola, an assistant professor of political science at Rice, were interested in how parental leave for non-traditional caregivers impacts individuals' deeply ingrained attitudes about stereotypical gender roles and sexism\u2014which can have adverse consequences when it comes to personal socioeconomic status and politics.For the study, the researchers examined the attitudes of 1,362 new parents who were and were not directly affected by a policy reform in Estonia that tripled the amount of fathers' leave time for babies born on or after July 1, 2020.They found that families with fathers who received more parental leave saw an increase in belief in gender equality among both men and women. They also found that direct exposure to such policies raised support among women for pro-female policies such as requiring political parties to field more female candidates at the expense of male candidates.Indirect exposure to such policy reform didn't change attitudes, the researchers found.\"We hope this study will show governments and organizations how direct exposure to progressive social policies can weaken sexist attitudes and be a practical and effective tool to reduce harmful biases,\" he said.The paper was co-authored by Margit Tavits of Washington University in St. Louis, Petra Schleiter of the University of Oxford and Dalston Ward of ETH Zurich and Stanford University.

  "text": "A new paper in the Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology indicates that the methods researchers use to report on analyses of survey data vary widely, and frequently contain mistakes. Publications containing these incorrect analyses yield results that can misinform policymakers, researchers, and practitioners. The researchers here propose new standards to improve the reporting of analyses using complex sample survey data.          For decades, researchers have documented methodological problems and analytic errors that are common in papers that use complex sample survey data of populations. These surveys employ sampling design features that\u2014when used appropriately\u2014can produce unbiased estimates of a population. For example, population samples routinely use complex design features to improve statistical efficiency, reduce costs, and increase sample sizes of underrepresented populations. However, complex samples deviate from simple random samples. This has important implications for analyzing and reporting the results.By default, most statistical software programs assume that data come from simple random samples. But not all survey data are collected using a simple random sample. It is therefore essential that investigators use the correct software procedures to account for complex sample design features when analyzing such data. Failing to account for complex design features can yield biased estimates and incorrect interpretations of the material.A 2016 paper analyzed data from the Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System and found that only 7.6% correctly accounted for sampling in variance estimation. The same paper found that a little more than half (54.5%) of papers correctly accounted for the sampling weights in analyses and only 10.7% of papers used appropriate subpopulation estimation. A separate review of publications analyzing data from the National Inpatient Sample found that some 80% of papers did not account for the sample's clustering and stratification. Another analysis found that less than half of papers analyzing data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey described appropriate weighting or variance estimation.The researchers here propose an itemized checklist to guide researchers in publishing analyses using complex sample survey data. The checklist, which they call the Preferred Reporting Items for Complex Sample Survey Analysis (or PRICSSA), consists of 17 important items to report for any analyses conducted on complex survey data, including sample sizes for all estimates, missing data rates and imputation methods, information about any data deleted, and an explanation about survey weighting and variance estimation. In addition to the checklist, the investigators here propose that researchers using complex survey data make all corresponding software code available.The authors believe that such reforms could greatly increase transparency and make analytic mistakes easier to spot. This, in turn, would make academics or other researchers less likely to commit them. The researchers here emphasize that they modeled their checklist after other checklists, such as the PRISMA checklist, widely used for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and the CONSORT guidelines, which are standard in randomized trials.Scholars and institutions have invested tremendous resources into survey design and data collection to try to produce accurate population estimates. Analyzing such data correctly necessitates that researchers incorporate certain complex survey design features into their work. The authors of this paper want to ensure that results reported in peer-reviewed publications do not misinform policymakers, practitioners, and researchers. They argue that their proposed checklist has the potential to increase the rigor and reproducibility of survey research by improving the quality of analysis and increasing transparency.\"It's a problem when papers get published and the analyses were performed incorrectly or cannot be reproduced,\" said the paper's lead author, Andrew Seidenberg. \"We created this checklist to help prevent that from happening.\" More information:Andrew B Seidenberg et al, Preferred Reporting Items for Complex Sample Survey Analysis (PRICSSA), Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology (2023).

  "text": "It's tempting to argue with someone who is misinformed by showing them studies and articles that prove they're wrong. But new research shows that there's another less confrontational way to get someone to change their mind.          A new study in Scientific Reports, led by Dolores Albarrac\u00edn, a social psychologist who specializes in attitudes and persuasion, and serves as the Alexandra Heyman Nash Penn Integrates Knowledge University Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, has found that \"bypassing\" misinformation is just as effective as debunking it head-on.This way requires considering what conclusions one wants their audience to reach\u2014is it that vaccines are safe, or that genetically modified (GM) foods are something to support?\u2014and supporting those conclusions with positive facts the audience may not have considered.The bypassing misinformation strategyThough debunking falsehoods with contrary facts works to change people's beliefs about falsehoods, it isn't easy. No one likes to be corrected and repeating misinformation to correct it runs the risk of cementing that misinformation into a person's memory or alienating them if they feel attacked.In the paper, Albarrac\u00edn\u2014Director of the Science of Science Communication division at the Annenberg Public Policy Center (APPC) and a faculty member at the Annenberg School for Communication, the School of Nursing, and the Department of Psychology\u2014and co-author Christopher Calabrese, formerly a postdoctoral fellow at APPC and now assistant professor at Clemson University, propose bypassing as a new method for addressing the outcomes of misinformation.The bypassing strategy involves identifying a conclusion, such as \"vaccines are safe,\" and figuring out how to bolster that conclusion with accurate information that doesn't directly refute misinformed claims.For example, to bypass a belief that vaccines cause health harm, one might highlight the positive impacts that vaccines have had around the world, such as vastly reducing child mortality. That alone can increase the conclusion that vaccines are desirable, without confronting that person with facts and figures to counter a false belief about vaccines.\"A fear that vaccines cause autism might be one belief that shapes a person's attitude toward vaccines,\" says Albarrac\u00edn, who is also the director of the Social Action Lab at Annenberg, \"but humans hold many beliefs at once. Bringing attention to positive ones can change people's minds.\"      Correcting vs. bypassingFor the study, Albarrac\u00edn and Calabrese carried out three experiments to test the efficacy of this strategy.During the first two experiments, participants read an article falsely claiming that a newly-developed GM corn product causes severe allergic reactions.Some participants then read an article disputing the previous article through facts and an alternate explanation\u2014a correction to the misinformation. Others read an article highlighting a positive benefit to GM foods, either their role in saving bees or ending global hunger\u2014bypassing the misinformation.As a control, some participants didn't receive a second article, and others read a second article on an unrelated subject. A third experiment tested a different misinformation article\u2014one falsely claiming that GM corn accelerates tumor growth in rats.ResultsDuring each experiment, the researchers measured participants' attitudes toward policies that restrict the manufacturing of GM foods (marking them as good or bad and helpful vs. unhelpful) as well as their intention to support these policies.They found that both bypassing and correction led to less support for GM food restrictions, implying that both had reduced the initial impact of the misinformation that GM foods cause allergies. These results held for attitudes toward GM restrictions and intentions to support the restrictions, which were less positive.We live in a world where misinformation spreads like wildfire. Bypassing is a tool that policy makers and influential figures should use to fight this misinformation, the researchers say.\"There's this perceived pressure to go out and debunk misinformation, but we can also strengthen other beliefs and consider misinformation within the wider system of beliefs people hold,\" Albarrac\u00edn says. \"Bypassing allows you to work from the point of view of what conclusion you want\u2014highlighting beliefs that support it instead of focusing solely on contradicting the misinformation.\" More information:Christopher Calabrese et al, Bypassing misinformation without confrontation improves policy support as much as correcting it, Scientific Reports (2023).

  "text": "Revelations and research over the last few years have shed light on how Instagram may negatively affect its youngest users. The most popular social media platform among 13- to 21-year-olds in America, Instagram was designed to connect people with shared interests. However, recent research has pointed to the use of social media as possibly contributing to a rise in mental health and eating disorders among teenage girls.          Researchers at Drexel University and Vanderbilt University are trying to figure out exactly what young users are experiencing on Instagram, in hopes of curtailing the negative trend and getting them the support they need.In a new paper, the team of researchers from Drexel's College of Computing & Informatics and Vanderbilt School of Engineering laid out the findings from their analysis of Instagram direct messages between users who asked for help in their conversations on the app.While this age group is known to use Instagram the most, the paper, entitled \"'Help Me:' Examining Youth's Private Pleas for Support and the Responses Received from Peers via Instagram Direct Messages,\" published in the Association for Computing Machinery's Proceedings of the 2023 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, is the first study looking at user-contributed private messages among teens to better understand the dynamics of how they ask for support from their peers on Instagram.\"Due to logistical challenges and privacy concerns there has been very little research on how this age group interacts in private online conversations\u2014particularly to exchange support,\" said Afsaneh Razi, Ph.D., an assistant professor in Drexel's College of Computing & Informatics, who a was a co-author of the paper. \"This study is the first of its kind to provide insight about these exchanges and lay out a framework for how the platform could offer support for users who are suffering.\"The team looked specifically at how youth initiate peer support conversations in private messages, the topics for which they're seeking support, and the types of support they received.Their findings suggest that young people on Instagram are more likely to share negative experiences\u2014ranging from everyday stress to severe mental health issues\u2014in private messages with friends and acquaintances they met online. Most disclosures were met with positive peer support; though the team also found specific sets of circumstances that led to support being denied.      The dataset analyzed was donated by 189 volunteer participants, ages 13-21, who each shared at least three months of their Instagram data from when they were between 13 and 17 years old. Each submission included direct message exchanges with at least 15 people, with at least two messages that made them or someone else feel uncomfortable.In total, the researchers collected 7 million messages. They sifted them down to 82 relevant conversations that included the words \"help me,\" comprising more than 336,000 individual messages. They found that most disclosures asking for help fell into four broad categories: mental health concerns, relationship issues, daily life issues, and abuse.\"Our study is one of the first to unpack how youth use social media platforms to privately seek support about serious issues. As researchers and designers, that means we need to account for this behavior in the design of social media platforms as well as improve education and awareness on equipping youth how to handle these types of hard conversations in a safe way,\" said Pamela Wisniewski, Ph.D., an associate professor in Vanderbilt University's Department of Computer Science.Mental health concerns came up in 61% of the conversations they analyzed. These ranged from emotional challenges and social anxieties, to riskier conversations about eating disorders and thoughts of suicide. Relationships issues\u2014among family, friends and romantic partners\u2014were discussed in 41% of the conversations; daily life issues\u2014work, school, health and financial problems\u2014in 27%; and abuse, including harassment, bullying and violence, was disclosed in 11%.Few conversations started out with someone seeking support\u201494% began as casual conversations, 74% as one-on-one chats, and evolved into a disclosure and a request for help. They found that about half of them were between friends, and about a quarter between acquaintances who had only met online; none of the conversations included family members.But in almost all cases, support was offered in some form\u2014from offering emotional support or kind words to build up the individual's self-esteem, to offering helpful information, tangible assistance, or a connection to support networks.\"We saw that in a large majority of conversations, when someone made a difficult disclosure, others in the conversation offered support by attempting to relate or empathize with their situation by sharing a similar experience, and providing information that could be helpful,\" said Jina Huh-Yoo, Ph.D., an assistant professor in Drexel's College of Computing & Informatics, who helped to lead the research. \"These mutual disclosures seemed to establish trust, even among people who had just met on the platform.\"The team also made a unique observation about the few times that someone did not offer support in a help-seeking conversation. These occurred in just a handful or fewer instances in each conversational category, but they followed a pattern that could be important, the researchers contend.\"We noticed that support was denied in instances when a participant in the conversation did not feel they were in a mental or emotional position to help or when there was a perceived imbalance in mutuality of support,\" Razi said. \"While this is a small subset of conversations, it represents a set of behaviors that has not been identified in previous research, so we believe it is a significant area for future research.\"Continuing to study teens' interactions on social media platforms, such as Instagram, could provide relevant insight into the increase in depression and self-harm that has emerged in recent years. Instagram is a particularly useful portal for this work, they suggest, because it invites informal and wide-ranging discussions that are not primarily focused on seeking help, which helps to avoid any perceived stigma associated with formal help-seeking activities such as counseling or therapy.In addition, the public-facing side of Instagram serves as a conversation starter based on mutual interests. This allows teens to grow a support network that includes more than just their offline friends\u2014and is not primarily focused on sharing problems or seeking support. In many cases, the team observed, conversations between two people who have a relationship offline allowed for a more authentic interaction, free from performative behavior or hindered by entangled relationships with others.What this all means, the team suggests, is that Instagram interactions present a valuable opportunity to integrate automated technology for providing support. They note that protecting the privacy of users and the integrity of conversations on the platform are paramount for preserving it as a channel where teens feel safe sharing their problems and asking for help, but tools could be created that would automatically and subtly provide resources and guidance within a conversation.\"Based on this finding, automatic support from conversational agents powered by Artificial Intelligence could help conversation members to know how balanced they are in exchanging support and when they would need extra support based on the frequency of exchanges and direction of the changes,\" they write. \"The automatic agents could help conversation members with guidance to additional resources when the other person refuses to support or provides unsupportive comments.\"While these findings are drawn from a small subset of Instagram users, who voluntarily participated in the research, the researchers suggest that their model for studying teen interactions on Instagram, and the tool they created to securely collect the data, is an entryway for expanding this important line of inquiry. The team notes that future research could look at how users' demographic background\u2014age, sex, race, or gender, for example\u2014affects how they seek support on social media. It could also expand to look at how help-seeking behavior differs between social media platforms.

A new survey conducted across the United States led by Professor in George Mason University's College of Public Health Amira Roess and faculty in the Department of Psychology, Leah Adams and Keith Renshaw, and student investigator Laura Henderson, shed new light on the changing demographic of firearm purchasers in response to the pandemic.The survey found that younger individuals (ages 35-40) were more likely to report purchasing a firearm for the first time due to the pandemic, as were individuals living in urban areas. They were also more likely to be Democrats, which had not previously been reported. Prior to the pandemic, American firearm owners were more likely to be male and 65 years and older, live in a rural setting, and be Republican.\"Understanding the changing demographic of who is purchasing firearms can prepare public health, law enforcement, and other responders for a possible surge in firearm-related societal impacts,\" said Roess.\"Our findings suggest that health education interventions that promote secure firearm storage are needed for new firearm owners and for firearm owners who live with children and others. This is a critical need especially given the reality that the United States does not have policies, nor will likely have any in the near future, to effectively reduce firearm-related violence, morbidity, and mortality.\"The survey found that Americans who purchased firearms during the pandemic, regardless of prior ownership, were more likely to report stockpiling behavior. Additionally, the survey found that keeping children at home and staying home in response to the pandemic were associated with pandemic firearm purchasing among both prior owners and new owners. The authors note that this is concerning because having children and firearms present in the same household has previously been linked to a significantly greater risk of firearm-related death.Researchers surveyed 3,853 online participants between December 2020 and January 2021. Quotas were set to match the U.S. Census Bureau's Voting and Registration Supplement to the Current Population Survey parameters for age, gender, race, educational attainment, census region, and Hispanic ethnicity. With the results, researchers compared demographic, pandemic-related behaviors, emotional response to COVID-19, and other determinants of those who purchased firearms in response to the pandemic with those who did not.The work is published in the journal Public Health.

  "text": "About one-third of our lives are spent at work, and the relationships we build there can have personal and professional benefits. But a majority of workers indicate difficulty connecting with co-workers socially, especially in the new landscape of remote and hybrid work arrangements.          To ease the friction caused by reduced in-person interaction, a team of researchers from Carnegie Mellon University's Human-Computer Interaction Institute created a Slack application that helps to initiate casual conversations and create affinity groups in an online workspace.\"We were freshly out of the pandemic, and we realized that everyone around us was complaining about how it's hard to build genuine connections,\" said Shreya Bali, the project's principal investigator who earned her master's degree from CMU's School of Computer Science in 2022. \"Online modes of communication do provide us with the technical tools to make connections, but there is still a lot of hesitation to actually initiate such conversations when you are not in the same room as someone.\"The team's new application, called Nooks, offers users a low-risk way to start new conversations in three phases: creation, incubation and activation. It starts with someone anonymously submitting a topic of interest. Then, the topic is incubated while the system presents it to other Slack users, allowing them to indicate if they are interested in the same topic. Once the incubation period is over, a private channel\u2014or \"nook\"\u2014is activated for this newly identified affinity group.\"Typically, when everyone's in the office at the same time, you can usually tell that if someone is near the water cooler it's OK to go and disturb them. Or if someone is walking in the corridor, you can start a conversation as you walk past,\" said Pranav Khadpe, an HCII Ph.D. student and one of the paper's co-authors. \"But online, we don't have those lightweight signals. Nooks can help to replace these social cues.\"Some of the app's features include batched notifications to avoid frequent disruption and anonymity not only in proposing a new topic, but also once the nook is created. No one can see the list of who is already a member of a certain nook\u2014a feature that could be especially helpful to newcomers.      \"Anyone interested can hop into a nook and break the ice without any preconceived notion of who is in the group,\" Bali said. \"This helps to avoid social anxiety of, say, not knowing anyone in the Nook or feeling intimidated if you see it includes colleagues of a different team or higher level.\"In addition to Bali and Khadpe, the research team includes Chinmay Kulkarni, of the HCII, and Geoff Kaufman, the Robert E. Kraut Associate Professor of Human-Computer Interaction and the institute's Ph.D. program director.The team tested the app for nine weeks with 25 student workers in a CMU summer research program. Eighty percent of these students were new to the university, and most were unacquainted, working across four different locations on campus. Of these participants, 22 participated in at least one Nook, with most participating in six.Topics ranged from discussing books and television shows to arranging meetups and sharing LinkedIn profiles. The researchers found that usage was higher in the beginning of the nine weeks and decreased toward the end. Participants indicated that by that point in their program, they had identified co-workers with whom they connected and took their conversations offline or in-person.\"In their interviews, most of the participants indicated that they felt Nooks did help to decrease the friction and perceived social risk of initiating new conversations and making new connections,\" Bali said.The system could improve collaboration and productivity by fostering positive social interactions at work, while simultaneously helping employers understand the needs and interests of their employees.\"Through Nooks, employers could find that a lot of people in their organization are interested in certain topics,\" Khadpe said. \"So in a way, it gives them a discovery mechanism they could use to organize more formal events or more formal interest groups in the workplace.\"The team will presented their paper \"Nooks: Social Spaces To Lower Hesitations in Interacting With New People at Work\" on Wednesday, April 26, at the Association for Computing Machinery's Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2023) in Hamburg, Germany. The paper is also published as part of the conference proceedings.The team says that in the future their framework can extend beyond Slack and integrate with other online messaging platforms, and they are looking for participants who would like to integrate the app into their workplace to continue deploying the application and seeing its use potential.\"Beyond supporting personal well-being, positive social interactions at work diffuse ideas, accelerate decision-making, promote better collaboration and enhance productivity,\" Khadpe said. \"It's a neat win-win situation that Nooks can help facilitate.\" More information:Shreya Bali et al, Nooks: Social Spaces to Lower Hesitations in Interacting with New People at Work, Proceedings of the 2023 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (2023).

  "text": "A brand's communication through social media posts is all the more effective the more it is in line with the image and values the public associates with the brand. This is the subject of a recent article in the Journal of Interactive Marketing by Sara Valentini of the Bocconi University, Milan, co-written with Elisa Montaguti of the University of Bologna and Federica Vecchioni, data scientist at Reply.          The study investigates what can drive followers to share promotional content posted by brands on social media and sheds light on what can influence the effectiveness of communication and the likelihood that a post will go \"viral\".A brand's presence on social networks is primarily intended to create \"engagement,\" that is, interaction via posts. In particular, one aspect of engagement that brands find attractive is the spontaneous sharing of content by users themselves, in marketing parlance \"rebroadcasting.\"When a follower shares commercial content with his or her network of acquaintances and friends, its impact, quite predictably, is much stronger because it is conveyed by the user and not directly by the brand, which can in turn take advantage of what is known in jargon as \"earned media.\"Those who communicate through social channels are therefore constantly under pressure to try to achieve this result, and may resort to eye-catching content that has little or nothing to do with brand values. Companies, for example, often try to tie their content to popular online themes, such as puppies, aphorisms, facts or trendy celebrities.However, these themes often do not match the brand's story and positioning. Thus, if using these easy elements failed to generate engagement, the end result would be doubly negative, having contributed to diluting the brand's online positioning.The authors conducted three different empirical studies aimed at testing to what extent the congruence of posts with brand values and the presence of promotions within the posts are important for rebroadcasting.In the first study, they monitored and analyzed one year of social media posts by four major brands. The second study is a field test conducted in cooperation with Samsung Italy. In this case, the company allowed the authors to tweak the content of experimental posts on their own pages, precisely for the purpose of collecting relevant data for this research.Both studies showed that consistency between online content and the values that followers associate with the brand has a positive effect on rebroadcasting frequency. Consequently, companies should be careful about using social media strategies that include elements unrelated to their image, as this may pose a risk of losing the attention of their fans.      Most interestingly, consistency with brand identity can generate a high number of shares even for posts containing price promotions. Indeed, it is not always easy for companies to persuade their fan base to share online content containing commercial cues such as discounts.However, they are about 109% more likely to get their followers to share a high-consistency post with a promotion than a generic post. In contrast, promotions associated with content out of tune with the brand turn out to be those with the lowest probability of spontaneous spread.The reasons for this phenomenon need to be explained. A third experiment, conducted using a panel of respondents provided by a market research firm, showed that the strongest driver for sharing a post with consistent promotional content is altruism. If people assume that a certain piece of content will be useful to their acquaintances, they will pass it around. Conversely, if a user feels manipulated, he or she will tend to do the opposite of what is desired, with an attitude known in cognitive psychology as \"reactance\".\"Our results suggest that posts consistent with brand values are less likely to trigger reactance. Therefore, companies that post online content on their pages must maintain a delicate balance to attract the interest of their audience while avoiding elements that are not in line with the brand image,\" Sara Valentini explains.\"At the same time, posts must spur the fan base to share communication with others. Including promotional incentives, for example, can elicit altruistic motivations in the fan base. However, it can also activate reactance; for this reason, it is important to match the incentive with cues that are consistent with the brand or in line with brand values.\" More information:Elisa Montaguti et al, Content That Engages Your Customers: The Role of Brand Congruity and Promotions in Social Media, Journal of Interactive Marketing (2022).

  "text": "Do you want to create a society through design where people with and without disabilities can live together as they are? Prof Mao Kudo of the Department of Media Design hopes that her research results are not just used to research further but that they become rooted in the fabric of society in transportation systems, and educational and public facilities. With her paper published in Visual Language, she set out to clarify the elements of graphic design in pictograms that make them easy for people with intellectual disabilities to understand.          People with intellectual disabilities rely on pictograms in public spaces to circumvent their difficulty understanding textual information. Pictograms in public places are support tools for receiving necessary information. There are efforts to standardize the JIS design of pictograms, but more surveys and feedback must be incorporated into the designs to make them more effective.People with intellectual disabilities have difficulty learning or understanding the meaning of existing pictograms, so surveying elucidates which designs are more intuitively understood.Through the study, Prof Kudo clarified five design elements that are factors in increasing pictogram comprehension.Adding a person to symbolize the location: adding a person asking another person questions instead of \"i\" symbol for \"information.\"The location element: adding the platform for the train station and the bus stop pole for the bus stop.The actual orientation: show items as they are oriented in real life, key, and locker in their actual orientation.Motion line: adding three little lines to represent movement or sound.Arrow: the longer the axis, the easier it is to understand. (1.9 times the length of the standard pictogram)Although the graphic elements that increase the comprehension of pictograms were elucidated, they did not apply to every circumstance. For example, there were some IQ groups (21 to 35 versus the 36 to 50) that were found to differ in their preference of pictograms as the position and directions of \"stand in two lines\" and \"please stand on the right or left.\" Further investigation into the conditions of the pictograms is needed.For example, the addition of the motion line was effective in increasing the understanding of the emergency button by (p<.05), but for \"please stand on the right or left,\" it had no effect. Prof Kudo could only speculate, based on her prior experience teaching at special needs schools, as to what elements the target pictogram had that caused the different outcomes. She wonders perhaps it is not very meaningless to add effective graphic elements if the object itself is drawn with abstract expression. She hopes to investigate this further.Interestingly, both people with and without intellectual disabilities had similar results with motion lines. The study also found that the longer the axis was for the arrows, the easier it was for people regardless of their disability status. This is important, that pictograms are understood by people with or without disabilities.It seems obvious, but it had not been clarified before that the same graphic elements have different effects depending on the subject. In addition, Prof Kudo had only been able to answer the question of what elements of the target pictograms are responsible for the different effects.                Five graphic elements were effective in increasing the understanding of pictograms. Credit: Visible Language When Prof Kudo began working on this issue during her doctoral program, she was asked, \"Why are you researching pictograms when they are already complete?\" However, as the research progressed, she found that people with and without disabilities both found the standardized, commonly observed pictograms challenging to understand.Furthermore, they both found the addition of a graphic element for context made it easier to understand the pictogram. Even when we think we have \"perfected\" the existing pictogram, we may have a bias of assumption. Rather than traveling far to discover the unknown, sometimes new findings can be made by approaching familiar things from a different perspective.Also, pictograms generally function in a particular environment as part of a sign. Still, it is not clear how people with disabilities perceive and interpret symbols and pictograms in the general environment.While it is essential to study and progress the design, it is even more important to know how people who use and see them perceive them, and this seems to shake up the design itself. Prof Kudo would like to work on this point for future studies. She hopes you will contact her if you too are interested in creating a society where people with and without disabilities can live together as they are.

  "text": "Young women seem to be less drawn to degrees in science or technology. But what is putting them off? A sociological study at UZH has revealed that outdated gender stereotypes\u2014such as supposed differences in analytical thinking\u2014play a major role.          Why do so few female school leavers with good grades in mathematics choose to study a technical subject\u2014despite the high salaries and good employment prospects in the STEM sector? This question has long preoccupied the social sciences, especially as studies show that girls and boys do equally well in mathematics at school.It is possible that socially embedded gender stereotypes play a role, such as: men think logically and in abstract terms, women are more creative; men should be the breadwinners, women take care of the family; men are competitive, women are more risk-averse. A study by Benita Combet from the Department of Sociology at the University of Zurich has now shown that some of these ingrained beliefs do indeed influence people's subject choices.Considering factors in isolationUntil now, researchers have struggled to conclusively answer the question of motives. \"The problem is that many of these field of study characteristics are simultaneously present,\" says study author Combet. For example, most STEM subjects involve a lot of math, require an affinity for technology, and can lead to high salaries, with part-time work in these fields (still) being rather rare. But how do we know which of these considerations is the deciding factor for or against a subject for prospective students?Combet chose a new approach for her study: instead of asking the participants about their interest in real subjects such as mathematics or psychology, she presented them with hypothetical fields of study that differed in specific ways\u2014for example, in terms of the possibility of part-time work or the requirements for analytical thinking and emotional intelligence. This enabled her to separate out the various factors in her analysis. About 1,500 Swiss high school students took part in the survey.Old habits die hard\"Surprisingly, the male students were influenced by two factors only: their preference for mathematics, and materialistic values such as salary and prestige,\" says Combet. The other factors seemed to be irrelevant for the young men. For young women, the picture was completely different: they were averse to subjects that required analytical rather than creative thinking and that demanded little in the way of social and emotional skills in everyday work.They also showed a preference for less competitive fields with the possibility of part-time work. Contrary to expectations, however, they were attracted to occupations with high salaries and prestige, just like the men.\"Especially with regard to factors such as logical thinking style and technical skills, strong gender stereotypes still exist, which obviously significantly influence the decisions of female high school students,\" says Combet. \"We should therefore continue to work on challenging and questioning these fixed beliefs.\" With regard to analytical thinking, for example, it has by no means been scientifically proven that there are differences between men and women. Moreover, the ability to think analytically is a basic requirement for almost every subject area.Combet also believes schoolchildren should be given better and more detailed information about future subject choices: \"Many of their current perceptions are not accurate.\" For example, many believe that to be good at engineering, all you need is an affinity for technology. In fact, says Combet, \"interpersonal and creative skills are also important in engineering, for example working in a team to develop new products.\"The study is published in the journal European Sociological Review.

  "text": "A new study has shown that the expectation that a bribe will be accepted leads to more attempts at bribery. However, in the experiment the actual corruptibility of officials of certain nationalities did not match the expectations of those offering bribes. Researchers urge that actively fighting biases can reduce corruption.          Whether or not people bribe\u2014or attempt to bribe\u2014others depends on which country the counterpart comes from. The nationality of the briber, in turn, is barely significant. That is the result of a study conducted with the participation of three researchers at the University of Cologne: Professor Dr. Bernd Irlenbusch, member of the Cluster of Excellence ECONtribute, Professor Dr. Andreas Gl\u00f6ckner and Dr. Angela Rachael Dorrough as well as scientists at the University of Amsterdam and the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin. The study has been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.With increasing globalization, more and more people interact across national borders. Until now, however, behavioral research has focused mainly on corruption within individual countries. Irlenbusch and his team explored corruption in a highly controlled, international environment in a large-scale experiment. As part of the study, approximately 6,500 people from 18 countries participated online in a bribery game. They took on the roles of citizens and officials, keeping their actual nationalities. The citizens had to decide whether they would buy a license through official channels or bribe the responsible officials in order to obtain the license at a lower price and to receive more money at the end of the experiment. The officials could either accept or refuse the bribe.In total, the citizens had to decide 18 times whether to bribe or not\u2014once for each nation in the sample. They were then asked to estimate how likely it was that the officials would accept the bribe. If the assessment was largely correct, they were paid a bonus. In a further step, the participants swapped roles. The study also accounted for the harm corruption causes within societies: For each successful bribe, the researchers actually donated less money to a non-governmental organization working to fight climate change.It turns out that citizens of all nations offered bribes above average to officials from countries with a reputation for corruption. Indian officials, for example, were almost twice as likely to be offered bribes as Canadian ones. \"Our study shows that the nationality of one's interaction partner and the expectations it gives rise to has a greater influence on the offering of bribes than one's own nationality,\" said Bernd Irlenbusch.However, the participants tended to over- or underestimate the acceptance rates: Officials from countries with a reputation for corruption were less likely to accept bribes than people expected. At the same time, \"citizens\" underestimated how often officials from countries that do not have a reputation for corruption accepted the money. For example, on average, participants expected 42% of U.S. citizens to accept bribes in their roles as public officials, while in fact they were successfully bribed 56% of the time. Among Russian officials in the game, the acceptance rate of 33% was significantly lower than the expected 47%.The results show a pattern of human behavior. \"People often base their behavior on what they expect others to do,\" Irlenbusch added. Efforts to overcome biases about certain nations could hence contribute to fighting corruption around the world, he concluded.

  "question_squad": " What was the average loan-to-value for a prime office loan in 2021?",
  "answer_squad": " 56.8%",
  "text": "The latest Bayes UK Commercial Real Estate Year-end 2022 report shows that despite the increase in interest rates in Q3 2022 and the decline in real estate market transactions, lenders continued to close new loans.          It does not come as a surprise that 65% was the result of refinancing. The strong business activity was also supported by an active secondary market, 24% of new lending was syndicated or concluded as a participation, hence overall average loan size was also larger than in previous years, with \u00a370m average loan size.Findings by Dr. Nicole Lux, lead author and Senior Research Fellow at Bayes Business School (formerly Cass), show that the alternative lender segment including insurance companies now provide 31% of new loans.Debt funds dedicated 55% of their new lending to development projects, with lenders confirming their financing support for transitioning assets, carbon zero assets and assets with clear, improved Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) credentials.Key highlights from the report, which covers data up to December 2022, also show:Development lending made up 23% of new origination in 2022, showing a new increase in commercial development finance, which for the first time post pandemic includes speculative development finance.Debt funds have taken on larger-scale asset transitioning projects, and supplied 61% of commercial development finance. Margins for prime office loans have moved out by 0.16%, to 2.7%, but loan margins for secondary offices moved by 0.46%, to 3.87%. The largest movement was seen for secondary industrial property which moved by 0.69%to 3.58%. Small to mid-size lenders price loans more expensively, 3.05%, than larger lenders, 2.31%. The pricing gap is even larger for secondary assets, such as secondary office, 5.17%versus 2.75%.42% of lenders have reported breaches and 47% have reported defaults across their loan book. In total, the average amount of loans in defaults reported was 3.5%, showing an increase again since 2021 (2.9%). The second half of 2022 was dominated by the increase in interest rates, which has left many real estate investors worried about the incremental cost of financing. This resulted in increased refinancing activity in Q4 2022 and borrowers refinanced early rather than waiting longer in 2023, or extended loans in to 2024.In addition to increasing lending margins, lenders also notably lowered the loan amounts on new loans. The average loan-to-value for a prime office loan is now 54.8%, while in 2021 it was still 56.8%. Similar movements were observed for all other property types.      Dr. Lux said, \"We are definitely seeing that large institutional borrowers are rushing to negotiate the best debt deals. As long as the income remains stable, new asset valuations are holding up and borrowers are negotiating their refinancing as early as possible.\"Credit: City University LondonMark Manson-Bahr, Global Head of Real Estate Finance, Allen & Overy LLP, said, \"2022 was a year of two halves with greater stress in the market due to macroeconomic risks, inflation and realignment of global supply chains affecting deal volumes in H2. It is pleasing to see from the Bayes 2022 report that real estate finance lenders are responding to this challenging environment to offer flexible credit solutions and certainty of execution, which continue to be prized by borrowers. Despite the retrenchment of some traditional lenders, increased activity from alternative credit providers looking to deploy capital will provide a competitive environment for borrowers seeking new financing or refinancing options in 2023.\"\"Lenders are demonstrating greater selectivity when granting loans. ESG and stewardship remain a core part of lenders' activities, notwithstanding market challenges, and this is a trend we expect to continue to gain momentum in 2023.\"Chris Gow, Head of Debt & Structured Finance, CBRE said, \"The Report helps highlight similarities and differences between the UK and US debt markets. In both markets Logistics and Living remain the most favored assets classes, smaller lenders have a greater percentage of loans in default and the significant year-on-year increase in the all-in-cost of debt has mainly been driven by higher reference rates. But there is no sign of a credit crunch in the UK. Banks are well capitalized, their liquidity remains strong and most continue to support borrowers and look for new origination opportunities, albeit at more conservative levels that before. We are also fortunate to have a very active and continually growing roster of Non-Bank Lenders who are eager to step into any further dislocation.\"Neil Odom-Haslett, President, Association of Property Lenders, said, \"2022 turned out to be a year with a number of challenges, with unexpected events both nationally and internationally. As the Bayes report highlights, the world of real estate started the year strongly but as the year moved forward the impact of these events caused the market to react with valuation corrections and increased interest rates\u2014it really was a year of contrasting halves. For the lenders it was a case of 'battening down the hatches' in H2 2022 and, as the report highlights, a number of lenders had an increase in loan covenant breaches and defaults. With lending liquidity reduced, of the lenders that were still actively lending, LTVs were reduced and spreads increased. The report also notes that certain asset classes are proving tricky to finance (e.g., secondary retail).\"\"The lending market has shown in the last few months it is able to pivot and adjust\u2014however the era of cheap (and easy) lending does seem to be over, certainly in the near term.\"Peter Cosmetatos, Chief Executive of CREFC Europe, said, \"At a time when financial regulators show renewed interest in both banking sector stability and real estate risk, we are fortunate to have this rich resource to provide insights into the intersection between the two.\"\"Unsurprisingly, given the rapid change in the interest rate environment, the research reveals rising stress, particularly in the parts of the lending market\u2014like smaller challenger banks and especially debt funds\u2014that serve higher risk real estate. However, there is little to suggest widespread real estate-related problems in the financial sector. The market is diversely funded and has not experienced excessive exuberance this cycle, and leverage has remained at sensible levels.\"Euan Gatfield, Head of EMEA CMBS and Loan Ratings, Fitch Ratings, said, \"2022 lending volumes held up remarkably well given LTVs were reined in and loan interest rates spiked. However, acquisition financing accounted for a lower share of lending than in any of the previous 15 years, and was largely the preserve of insurance companies, debt funds and overseas banks.\"\"Also noteworthy is that around half of refinancing involved a change of lender, well above the norm. How much this reshuffling reflected divergence in lender risk appetite or balance sheet costs remains to be seen. An interesting parallel is the question of how much the repricing of CMBS in 2022 reflected divergence in credit risk versus funding pressures facing some bond investors.\"\"Whatever lay behind those reallocations, we believe that for this and next year credit risk will be the dominant theme for lenders. Property values have already fallen quite a bit, banks are facing renewed scrutiny, office markets especially present considerable uncertainty, while typical five-year loans reaching maturity will have been shaped by looser standards of 2018 and 2019 origination.\" More information:Bayes CRE Lending Report: www.bayes.city.ac.uk/faculties \u2026 s-cre-lending-reportProvided byCity University LondonCitation:Report: UK lenders entered 2023 on a high, after high refinancing activity in Q4 2022 (2023, April 26)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-uk-lenders-high-refinancing-q4.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "A long-held belief among scholars and observers of Indian elections has been that voters in India do not view health as an important electoral issue.          New research from King's India Institute and partners suggests this assumption is incorrect and health does influence voting decisions, particularly at the state level.A pilot survey of Indian voters conducted by Lokniti, Center for the Study of Developing Societies, revealed health is one of three priority areas for voters. While it is not the determining factor, it ranks alongside education and behind employment. Voters from poor and marginalized backgrounds were also more likely to identify health as a top priority.\"It has long been assumed that low political prioritization of health in India reflects a lack of voter demand. This study demonstrates that when we unpack the idea of 'development,' voters see health as a crucial component of the fortunes of their household and their local area. For older voters and those from more disadvantaged backgrounds, it looms even larger as a priority,\" says Professor Louise Tillin, lead investigator and professor of politics.The researchers found that voters who perceive an improvement in public health services are 10% more likely to vote for the ruling party in state-level elections than voters who perceived no change or worsening health services. However, voting decisions in national-level elections appear to be less impacted by the perceived performance of government hospitals.Many voters were also unclear about which level of government\u2014local, state or national\u2014was responsible for the condition of health care services, despite 80% of voters saying it was the government's responsibility to provide health care.Most (37%) correctly identified state governments as bearing responsibility for running hospitals, but a substantial number attributed responsibility to all three levels (21%), and to the central government (14%) or to the local government (17%).\"The findings suggest that state-level governments do have incentives to invest in health services, given the latent demand from voters and the potential for electoral rewards. However, the unclear attribution of responsibility may blur lines of accountability with voters uncertain about who to credit or blame for health system improvements,\" says Professor Louise Tillin.The survey involved face-to-face interviews with 1,522 citizens across five Indian states\u2014Bihar, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh\u2014conducted between March to April 2022. It sought to answer four broad questions: How much do voters care about health? How satisfied are voters with the provision of health services in India? Who do voters credit (or blame) for the provision of health services? And, does health care impact voting decisions?The outcomes of the study have been published on the Lokniti-CSDS website and in The Hindu.

  "text": "The earliest inhabitants of Puerto Rico might have used common burial sites and mortuary practices across many centuries, according to a study published April 26, 2023, in the open-access journal PLOS ONE by William J. Pestle of the University of Miami, Florida and colleagues.          Puerto Rico was inhabited by people for several thousand years prior to the Ceramic Age, but little is known about these earliest inhabitants due to a paucity of evidence and research, with only 20 ancient individuals reported from this time period. In this study, Pestle and colleagues describe five adult individuals from burials at the Ortiz site in Cabo Rojo, southwestern Puerto Rico, representing a substantial addition to archaeological information about this time period.Radiocarbon dating of the remains yielded ages as old as 1800 BC and as young as 800 BC, thus including the oldest directly dated human remains from Puerto Rico and representing as much as 1,000 years of burials at the Ortiz site. The mortuary practices, including the positioning of the bodies and the associated grave goods, are similar to other early sites, indicating standard burial practices over many centuries. In addition, Strontium isotope analysis also indicates that these buried individuals were born in different nearby geographical locales. Thus, the Ortiz site might have held cultural significance as a common mortuary space for various local communities.The authors caution that it is difficult to draw broad conclusions from limited evidence, but these results hint at a long history of persistent and formalized use of a common site over centuries. The earliest inhabitants of Puerto Rico have been traditionally interpreted in a simplistic fashion, but the results from this study and hopefully future studies shed light on what was likely a more vibrant and varied cultural landscape than previously appreciated.The authors add, \"This study assiduously documents the oldest dated burials from the island of Puerto Rico and provides detailed scientific and cultural insights into the lives of some of the earliest people to inhabit that island. We hope that this work contributes to the ongoing re-framing of our understanding of the deep past of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean.\" More information:Reconsidering the lives of the earliest Puerto Ricans: Mortuary Archaeology and bioarchaeology of the Ortiz site, PLOS ONE (2023).
