  "text": "With a warmer climate creating more humid conditions in the Northeast, extreme precipitation events\u2014defined as about 1.5 or more inches of heavy rainfall or melted snowfall in a day\u2014are projected to increase in the Northeast by 52% by the end of the century, according to a new Dartmouth study.          The findings are published in Climatic Change.\"As climate change brings warmer temperatures, you have more water vapor in the atmosphere, which creates the right conditions for extreme precipitation,\" says first author Christopher J. Picard '23, an earth sciences major and undergraduate researcher in the Applied Hydroclimatology Group at Dartmouth.\"Our findings show that this increase in extreme precipitation will be primarily driven by more frequent heavy rainfall events, not by the intensity of such events,\" says Picard. \"In other words, we expect a large increase in the number of extreme precipitation days, and a smaller increase in the amount of rain on each extreme precipitation day.\"The findings also show that winter and spring contribute most to the projected 52% increase in extreme precipitation in the region by 2070 to 2099, with increases of 109% and 89%, respectively.Through previous research, senior author Jonathan Winter, an associate professor of geography and lead of the Applied Hydroclimatology Group at Dartmouth, and other collaborators investigated how heavy rainfall events in the Northeast have changed historically. By examining data from 1901 to 2014, they found that there was about a 50% increase in extreme precipitation from 1996 to 2014, and that the increase was linked to climate change.\"Building on our earlier work, we were particularly interested in determining how much extreme precipitation is expected to change across the Northeast in the future,\" says Winter.Similar to their other papers, the new study defines the Northeast as Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C.Dartmouth's study found that extreme precipitation increases are projected to be largest in West Virginia, parts of Pennsylvania, central New York, and northeastern Maine, with predominantly smaller increases along the Atlantic coast and south of Lake Ontario.The researchers applied a regional climate model from the National Center for Atmosphere Research to simulate precipitation for a historical period of 1996 to 2005 and future period of 2070 to 2099. Then, they compared their results to simulations of changing heavy rainfall events from other regional climate models, and found that their results are consistent with the other regional climate model simulations, which predict increases in extreme precipitation ranging from 58% to 169%.\"Extreme precipitation events can pose threats to life, property, infrastructure, and the environment,\" says Winter.Previous research has reported how flooding, landslides, and erosion from these events can wash out roads, trigger agricultural runoff of pollutants, and damage recreational areas. \"So, understanding where the flood plain is actually located, having the right sized culverts or green infrastructure in place, and properly designing roads and bridges, are important to managing the extra water that we're likely to encounter in the future,\" he says.

  "text": "Water conflicts are nothing new to the arid West, where myriad users long have vied for their share of the precious resource from California's Central Valley to the Colorado and Missouri rivers.          But few have waded into the legal question playing out in rural Nevada: To what extent can local residents, farmers and ranchers claim the water that is soaking into the ground through the dirt floor of an antiquated, unlined irrigation canal?A federal appeals court recently breathed new life into litigation that has entangled the U.S. government and the high-desert town of Fernley ever since a 118-year-old canal burst and flooded hundreds of homes in 2008.This year the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation began work on a plan to line parts of the 31-mile (50 kilometer) canal with concrete. The canal diverts water from the Truckee River, which flows out of Lake Tahoe in the Sierra, sending it to irrigation ditches supporting alfalfa farmers and livestock ranchers about 30 miles (50 kilometers) east of Reno.However, farmers and ranchers in and around the town of Fenley said the repairs would stop water from leaking that they have used for a century to help fill their wells east of Reno.The government says locals don't have any rights to the water that belongs to U.S. taxpayers. Government experts say the renovation also willl help guard against future canal failures even though they acknowlege it will prevent leaks into the local aquifer used by Fenley's residents.Completed in 1905, the Truckee Canal was the first major irrigation system in the West under the Newlands Reclamation Act signed by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1902.

A U.S. appeals court has breathed new life into a rural Nevada's town's unusual bid to halt government repairs to an aging, federal irrigation canal that burst and flooded nearly 600 homes 15 years ago.

Credit: AP Photo/Scott Sonner, File             The act was named after a Nevada congressman who said the project would \"make the desert bloom\" and attract settlers to places like Fernley, where annual rainfall averages 5 inches (13 centimeters).Similar projects followed across the arid West\u2014many much larger. Construction began in 1903 on the Theodore Roosevelt Dam on the Salt River in Arizona, which Roosevelt himself dedicated in 1911.By then, two dozen projects had been authorized, including one that dammed the Lower Yellowstone River near its confluence with the Missouri to irrigate cropland in Montana and North Dakota.      In Nevada, Fernley and surrounding agricultural users eventually became \"utterly reliant\" on the government-subsidized water, their lawyers say.Evoking a sort of finders-keepers doctrine as old as western expansion, opponents of the canal renovation have argued in state and federal court that they have a right to the water partly because, before the canal burst, no one told them they couldn't.The bureau, the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District operating the canal and various judges generally have agreed the water belongs to U.S. taxpayers.Fernley is attempting to claim a water right that doesn't exist under state or federal law, irrigation district lawyer Benjamin Shawcroft said in recent Nevada Supreme Court filings.

Credit: AP Photo/Brad Horn, File             \"A related, but perhaps unanswerable question is why the City of Fernley is so determined to disrupt a project, the sole purpose of which is to prevent a breach of the canal and flooding of hundreds of homes?\" he wrote.Fernley lawyer David Rigdon said the town doesn't oppose less expensive alternatives to alleviate the flood risk while still maintaining groundwater recharge.\"What Fernley opposes is a cure that is worse than the disease,\" Rigdon wrote in court filings. \"To fix a problem that affected approximately 500 homes, they have implemented a solution that imperils the primary water supply of all 20,000 city residents.\"\"And, to add insult to injury, they now want the very people they are harming to pay for the costs of building the project,\" he wrote.No one was killed or seriously injured in the 2008 flood, but the irrigation district agreed in 2016 to an $18.1 million class-action settlement with 1,200 people who suffered property damage. Unusual, heavy winter rain put pressure on the canal system, which experts later determined was weakened by decades of rodents burrowing into the sides.The legal battle over the plans to fix the canal followed.Fernley sought relief in state court last year after U.S. District Court Judge Miranda Du threw out its federal lawsuit, which claimed the government failed to adequately consider alternatives required by the National Environmental Policy Act when it approved a $148 million plan to line 12.7 miles (20 km) of the canal.

  "text": "Just after midnight on April 30, residents near the Salton Sea in Southern California were jolted awake by a magnitude 4.3 earthquake. Dozens of people told the U.S. Geological Survey that they felt the shaking, with a couple locals reporting it was strong enough to knock items over or break dishes.          Less than a minute later, another temblor the same size hit a mile away. Then a third struck just before 1 a.m., and over the next two days dozens of smaller quakes followed.Anytime there's a swarm of earthquakes in their community locals can't help but think about the steam billowing from a dozen geothermal power plants that have sprung up along the Salton Sea's southeastern shore over the past four decades.They wonder, could decades of drilling thousands of feet into the Earth's crust and pumping out boiling brine to make renewable energy be causing some of these quakes? And could drilling and testing in the area by companies rushing to extract lithium needed for electric vehicle batteries be increasing the risk?Those were among the concerns raised by some 50 residents who attended a community meeting May 15 at a Niland elementary school, where they asked a team of researchers about new lithium extraction and geothermal projects underway in the area.\"They always ask about seismicity and earthquakes, and how much of that is natural and how much might be due to geothermal power production,\" noted Michael McKibben, a geology research professor from UC Riverside who helped lead that presentation.Turns out, for a variety of reasons we'll get to soon, that's a tough question to answer in this region.But seismologists say one thing is clear: Anytime we drill thousands of feet into the ground, and monkey around with pressure in the Earth's crust, there's a potential for triggering earthquakes.And a series of even small quakes can trigger temblors on nearby fault lines. That's why seismologists watch closely when swarms happen in this area, since the Salton Sea marks the end of the southern stretch of the San Andreas Fault. Scientists believe that particular stretch of the mighty San Andreas, which hasn't ruptured since 1680, is capable of generating a magnitude 8 quake that could devastate California.\"We know someday it's going to pop,\" said William Ellsworth, a geophysics professor at Stanford University.That's got some people worried about whether energy projects at the Salton Sea could be putting the region\u2014and much of Southern California\u2014at greater risk for a major earthquake.\"I am definitely concerned about this,\" said Jeremy Merrill, who lives in east San Diego County and received email notifications about the recent swarm.\"We are currently predicted to have a major quake in Southern California within the next few decades. And if this accelerates it, that is a huge risk.\"A decade-old study out of UC Santa Cruz found a correlation between geothermal production and spikes in seismic activity around the Salton Sea. But Andrew Barbour, who studies induced quakes as a geophysicist with the U.S Geological Survey, doesn't believe there's scientific consensus on whether swarms have accelerated in the years since companies started to tap the geothermal field.The most comprehensive look at data related to that question is due out this summer, when McKibben's team releases a long-awaited report on the area's geothermal field that will compare more than four decades of seismic activity with local geothermal power production.In the meantime, experts say there are a few things companies and regulators can do to minimize the risks of induced earthquakes, help researchers get a better grasp of those risks, and help prepare the community if temblors happen.But since there's no way to eliminate the risk altogether, scientists say this is one more example of the dilemmas we face as we try to quickly curb climate change without creating a new set of hazards.\"These are tough choices we have to make as a society,\" said Michael Manga, a planetary sciences professor at UC Berkeley who's studied this region.\"We need power, so we're getting geothermal power and the potential for lithium to make batteries. And I guess we're trading that off with the possibility of having induced earthquakes.\"      Risk baked inThe same conditions that make the southern end of the Salton Sea ripe for lithium extraction also make it prime for seismic activity.Multiple fault lines, including the San Andreas, run through the area. Those faults allow magma that's usually trapped a couple dozen miles beneath the Earth's surface, in the thick mantle layer, flow up to the crust. Once there, the magma heats an aquifer of mineral-rich water that sits 4,000 to 12,000 feet underground to more than 500 degrees.Berkshire Hathaway, under its spinoff company CalEnergy, was the first to tap that geothermal brine when it opened a power plant in the area in 1982. Through wells drilled more than a mile deep, super-heated geothermal brine travels under high pressure to a low-pressure tank at the surface. The change in pressure turns some of the fluid into vapor, which drives a turbine that makes electricity.CalEnergy added nine more geothermal plants in the area over the next 18 years. Then, in 2012, San Diego-based EnergySource added one more, bringing to 11 the number of geothermal plants operating on the southeastern edge of the Salton Sea.For decades, after those plants captured steam from the brine, they've sent all the lithium-rich liquid back into the earth. But recently, as demand for lithium has surged, researchers have scrambled to come up with the most efficient way to extract lithium from that brine before sending everything else back underground.That lithium boom attracted a third player to the Salton Sea. Controlled Thermal Resources drilled another well last year and plans to eventually drill as many as 60 to produce geothermal power and capture lithium and other valuable minerals from the brine.For those companies, Ellsworth said smaller earthquakes are actually good for business because they help keep the geothermal field active. But building infrastructure also is very expensive, which means a lot of money would be on the line if any seismic activities were to trigger a big enough quake to damage power plants. So UC Berkeley scientist Manga said he hopes investors are pressuring companies for solid due diligence, which includes finding out as much as possible about the seismic hazards.None of the companies operating geothermal plants in the area answered questions about their calculations or potential steps to minimize risks.Controlled Thermal Resources was the only company to offer any response, with a written statement pointing out how the region is already prone to seismic activity. The company also noted that any well operations are subject to strict permitting and reporting requirements. And, the statement said, \"It is important to note that no earthquakes have been attributed to geothermal production in the 40 years of operations in the Salton Sea geothermal area.\"Experts say that is accurate in a strict sense. But they also said there's no way to know if that's simply due to unique challenges at play in this seismically active area.Gauging the level of riskWhen people raise concerns posed by geothermal activities at the Salton Sea, they often cite the well-documented introduction of quakes in once-quiet places like Texas and Oklahoma due to oil fracking.Any such connection is much tougher to suss out when it comes to local geothermal activity for two simple reasons, according to federal geophysicist Barbour: There's simply too much natural seismic activity already underway in the Imperial Valley and not enough specific, long-term data to sort out the differences.But when it comes to inducing quakes, fracking also is believed to carry a greater risk than geothermal operations due to key distinctions in the different processes.With fracking, companies use deep wells to shoot highly pressurized water, sand and chemicals to split open and widen cracks in underground rock formations, releasing gas or crude oil trapped within those formations. Since that increases pressure underground, Barbour said, it's easy to see why those processes have been linked to spikes in seismic activity.Geothermal operations, on the other hand, are only replacing fluids they previously extracted. So companies like to say they're \"stabilizing\" the Salton Sea's geothermal field when they inject material.However, half a dozen scientists interviewed for this story said all geothermal power operations can induce earthquakes.On the one hand, Ellsworth said removing fluids from the geothermal field should reduce pressure and therefore reduce stress on earthquake faults. But Barbour pointed out some fluid gets lost during the engineering process, which means companies are injecting a lower volume of fluid than they extracted. He said studies have found any reduction in geothermal fluids can cause underground rocks to contract and impact stress on nearby faults.In 2006, Basel, Switzerland experienced a series of quakes, up to magnitude 3.6, shortly after a geothermal plant finished drilling on top of a fault there. Residents protested and the plant was quickly shut down.There's at least one example of a geothermal company operating near the Salton Sea allowing an injection well site to become over pressurized to the point that fluids broke through the crust and made it back to the surface. The incident happened in April 2021, according to emailed responses from the California Department of Conservation. The state agency didn't respond to repeated requests about which operator owned the well, but said that well and others in the area were shut down until extensive safety tests were conducted.Records of that violation, and any others by area operators, don't appear to be posted publicly. The Department of Conservation said violation notices would take some time to compile and weren't available at press time.Along with changes to underground pressure, geothermal companies also are injecting cooled fluids back into the earth, with the temperature often dropping from more than 500 degrees to closer to 100 degrees. The USGS lists such temperature changes as a \"significant factor\" in why Northern California's Geysers Geothermal Field, which experienced its own swarm in April, regularly triggers small quakes that rattle residents in the nearby town of Cobb.While plants there operate a bit differently than the plants at the Salton Sea, with additional wastewater injected into the Northern California geothermal field to restore depleted fluids, researchers said both extract hot materials and inject cooled materials. One notable difference, Ellsworth pointed out, is that the Geysers facility isn't near any major fault lines.In 2013, researchers from UC Santa Cruz released a study showing quake patterns near the Salton Sea mirroring patterns in geothermal energy production. Lead author Emily Brodsky said she hasn't been tracking data from the region since then, deferring to other experts for comment on this story.Several seismologists said that while they didn't dispute the correlation in Brodsky's study, there was some controversy over an observation tacked onto the end of the paper that suggested quake swarms near the geothermal field could trigger a bigger quake along the San Andreas fault.The end of the San Andreas fault is about a dozen miles from where geothermal production takes place, Barbour pointed out. That may not seem far. But he said the southern shore would likely need to see quakes significantly larger than what's on record to date, with peaks in the magnitude 5 range, to set off the San Andreas fault.Minimizing the risksWhile there's no way to eliminate the risk of geothermal operations triggering earthquakes, scientists said there are a few things companies and regulators can do to help.One is to ensure that no one is drilling wells or injecting cooled material directly over a local fault line, Barbour said.Others suggested implementing a \"traffic light\" system for geothermal plants that's similar to what fracking operators must use, where they get alerts if they're injecting materials and raising pressures too quickly.All scientists interviewed for this story said they'd like to see more frequent, comprehensive and and transparent data collection.Right now, companies have to report monthly production and injection rates to the state, with those reports available on the the Department of Conservation's website. But that data is posted a couple months late. To be able to draw a clean line between geothermal operations and particular earthquakes, scientists said companies would need to report that data daily and regulators would need to quickly make it available to the public.As a condition of their permits, geothermal companies also have to install seismic monitors at their sites and include earthquake data in annual reports submitted to state and Imperial County regulators. But the state doesn't have, let alone post, electronic copies of those annual reports, the conservation department said. Hard copies weren't available by press time.Those monitors also are not connected to state or federal earthquakes systems, which track quakes in real time. Public systems have gotten better at determining the size, and location of quakes since they were first installed in the Salton Sea area 91 years ago, Barbour said. But they're still some distance away from injection well sites on geothermal company land. So Barbour said researchers would be able to get a better handle on what's happening if companies were required to share detailed quake data from their on-site monitoring stations.One other step Ellsworth suggested is for the Salton Sea region to establish a fund similar to one set up for residents near the Geysers geothermal plants. There, he said companies pay into a fund locals can tap into if an earthquake in the region causes property damage.None of the companies responded to a request asking if they'd be willing to consider such a move.Weighing the risks vs. benefits here is tough, Merrill said.\"The benefit of increased electric vehicle production is great for the environment, but a major quake has the potential to cause massive damage to critical infrastructure,\" he said. \"I'd probably err on the side of protecting the people who live here in the region as a priority until alternative means of lithium extraction can be developed.\"So far, thanks to recent jolts of public and private funds, the seismic shift underway to turn the Salton Sea into Lithium Valley shows no signs of slowing down.    2023 MediaNews Group, Inc.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "text": "In the not too distant future, California's coastline and its iconic beaches could be washed away, leaving only cliffs behind.          A new U.S. Geological Survey study found from 25% to 70% of California's beaches could erode by 2100 due to rising sea levels caused by global temperature increases and greenhouse gas emissions.Substantial management efforts like dune restoration are necessary to maintain the beaches and prevent catastrophic erosion, the authors of the study said.\"Beaches are perhaps the most iconic feature of California, and the potential for losing this identity is real,\" wrote Sean Vitousek, the lead researcher. \"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human-management efforts must increase in order to preserve them.\"The U.S. States Geological Survey used two decades worth of satellite imagery of Ocean Beach in San Francisco\u2014combined with models of sea levels rising from 1.6 to 10 feet due to global temperature increases\u2014to estimate how the entire state's coastline will shift in the next century.That range is expected to vary based on the rate and reduction of carbon emissions over time.While it may seem like that reality is in the distant future, the West Coast could see its sea levels rise up to eight inches in the next 25 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Researchers say intervention is needed to preserve the coastline, but California's legislature is reducing funds that would do just that. Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed a $700 million cut from the coastal resiliency fund used to support the shoreline, CalMatters reported. That chunk is part of a proposed $6 billion reduction in climate change programs amid a $22.5 billion statewide deficit.Particular stretches of the California coastline are more at risk of severe erosion, including Point Arena and Humboldt Bay in northern California, Pismo Beach and Morro Bay in central California, and Newport Beach and San Clemente in southern California.The coastal bluff along East Cliff Drive in Santa Cruz is vulnerable to rising sea levels during big storms. Earlier this year, a \"van-sized\" chunk of cliff near Lighthouse Point collapsed into surfer-filled waters.The 2.7-mile promenade of West Cliff Drive in Santa Cruz is also in danger of expedited erosion as well. This winter's seemingly endless rain storms took a toll on the popular cliffside road, and amid the already rising sea levels, community members and local leaders are concerned about its future.\"This was sort of a wake-up call,\" Gary Griggs told the New York Times. He is a professor of earth sciences who has taught at UC Santa Cruz since the 1960s. \"I've never seen this much damage this quickly in my 55 years here. So it's time to step back and say, 'This is what's coming.'\"The city is facing $13 million in repairs for West Cliff after the recent storms, city manager Matt Huffaker said. The city could incur another $1 billion in erosion and other climate-related damage by the end of the century, the New York Times reported.The USGS study is in the process of being peer reviewed and follows up on a 2017 paper from the same researchers that predicted 31% to 67% of beaches in Southern California were in danger of disappearing.Losing California beaches could impact the tourism economy and damage homes and businesses close to the water.A 2009 study from USGS found that 40% of beaches were already experiencing long-term erosion.    2023 MediaNews Group, Inc.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "text": "A California Department of Fish and Wildlife plan to introduce tidal flows into the Ballona Creek wetlands has come to a screeching halt after a judge ruled recently that the agency's environmental impact report on the project failed to adequately account for flood risks.          In a May 17 decision, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James C. Chalfant ordered the agency to set aside its certification of the final EIR for the project because it \"failed to disclose and analyze flood control design parameters\" associated with proposed levees and other infrastructure.In response to four lawsuits filed by environmental groups, Chalfant ordered the agency to suspend any project activity in the 600-acre West Los Angeles ecological refuge and prepare a new \"legally adequate\" environmental impact report \"if it chooses to proceed.\"Despite the setback, state officials said they intend to correct the EIR and move forward with the controversial project, which is sandwiched between Marina del Rey and urban development upstream of Ballona Creek.\"This restoration project remains the best mechanism to revitalize the Ballona Creek wetlands for many future generations of Angelenos,\" said Jordan Traverso, a spokeswoman for the Department of Fish and Wildlife.Combatants on both sides of the issue, however, suggest that a series of recent events left the fate of the wetlands area uncertain.On Thursday, the Supreme Court issued a decision that significantly reduces the scope of the Clean Water Act and reduces the federal government's ability to protect thousands of miles of rivers, streams, creeks and adjacent wetlands throughout the western U.S.The court said the law's protections for the \"waters of the United States\" are limited to wetlands and streams that are directly connected to navigable waterways\u2014a definition that some fret might not include the Ballona Creek wetlands.Separately, Gov. Gavin Newsom a week ago unveiled a proposal aimed at shortening the contracting process for bridge and water projects, limiting timelines for environmental litigation and simplifying the permitting process for complicated developments in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and elsewhere.It remains to be seen how these actions may affect the Ballona Creek wetlands\u2014the focus of one of the longest environmental battles in Southern California history.      In the meantime, opponents of the state project\u2014which was originally scheduled to begin in 2024\u2014say the judge's ruling has provided them an opportunity to press for the withdrawal of what they regard as an ecologically unsound proposal.Chalfant's ruling applies to lawsuits filed against the Department of Fish and Wildlife by Protect Ballona Wetlands, Ballona Wetlands Land Trust, Grassroots Coalition and Defend Ballona Wetlands.\"We welcome the ruling,\" said Marsha Hanscom, a community organizer for Defend Ballona Wetlands. \"It gives the mosaic of habitats at the ecological reserve a reprieve from facing utter destruction and upheaval by state officials who\u2014shockingly\u2014favor sending bulldozers and other heavy equipment into these fragile wetlands.\"She fears that dozens of struggling species, and much of their habitat, would be sacrificed by restoration-related excavation, and the addition of 10 miles of bike paths.Under the state's plan, more than 2 million cubic yards of soil would be repositioned to create earthen levees up to 20 feet high for flood protection from Pacific Ocean tides.Exposing the wetlands to tidal influence would be a mistake, opponents argue, because higher salinity levels could wipe out flora, fauna and habitat that currently rely on seasonal rains and brackish water. Beyond that, they say, it would make the area vulnerable to potentially destructive flooding.In his ruling, Chalfant sided with the petitioners in ordering the state to commit to specific performance criteria in the event that its activities harmed wildlife and habitat.Once owned by industrialist Howard Hughes, the property sits just north of Los Angeles International Airport and is home to ring-necked snakes, great blue herons, South Coast marsh voles and the federally endangered El Segundo blue butterfly.The state paid $139 million in voter-approved bond money in 2003 to buy what was left of the Ballona Wetlands from Playa Capital, the developer of Playa Vista. The deal made the highly degraded expanse of marshes, mud flats and salt pans off limits to development.The restoration project is supported by nonprofit environmental groups such as Heal the Bay, the Bay Foundation, Friends of Ballona Wetlands and David Kay, a former senior manager at Southern California Edison's environmental department.In a recent Patch article, Kay pointed out that Chalfant rejected 24 of the 26 arguments presented in one of the lawsuits. \"The judge's ruling,\" he wrote, \"represents a spectacular failure by the opponents to achieve their long-stated goal of stopping the restoration project altogether.\"Hanscom, however, said Kay misses the point. \"In fact,\" she said, \"the judge gave us what we wanted most: Invalidate the EIR and halt all state work at the reserve.\"\"This fight is far from over,\" she added. \"We're not giving up on defending the wildlife that clings to survival in these precious remnant wetlands.\"    2023 Los Angeles Times.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "question_squad": " What is the process called that removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere?",
  "answer_squad": " carbon dioxide removal",
  "text": "One of the primary drivers of climate change is excess greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Mitigating climate change in the coming century will require both decarbonization\u2014electrifying the power grid or reducing fossil fuel-guzzling transportation\u2014and removing already-existing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a process called carbon dioxide removal.          Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Yale University are proposing a novel pathway through which coastal ecosystem restoration can permanently capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Seagrass and mangroves\u2014known as blue carbon ecosystems\u2014naturally capture carbon through photosynthesis, which converts carbon dioxide into living tissue.\"Mangroves and seagrasses extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere all day long and turn it into biomass,\" said Chris Reinhard, an associate professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences (EAS). \"Some of this biomass can get buried in sediments, and if it stays there, then you've basically just removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\"In May, the researchers presented their research, \"Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement Through Restoration of Blue Carbon Ecosystems,\" in Nature Sustainability.Restoring these ecosystems could potentially benefit local flora and fauna and help to energize coastal economies. But Reinhard and colleagues suggest that restoring them could also remove additional carbon through a novel pathway while combating increasing acidity in the ocean.Carbon 101There are two major types of carbon that cycle through the Earth system: organic carbon and inorganic carbon. Organic carbon is contained in living matter, such as algae, plants, animals, and even humans. This form of carbon can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere temporarily, but if it becomes buried in sediments at the sea floor, it can lead to permanent carbon dioxide removal. Inorganic carbon can also be found in many forms, including rocks and minerals, but is present as a significant dissolved component of ocean water.Roughly 30% of the carbon emitted by human activities since the Industrial Revolution is now stored as dissolved inorganic carbon in the ocean. Although carbon dioxide stored as organic carbon can be disrupted, effectively redistributing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, carbon dioxide removal by inorganic carbon is potentially much more durable.\"Even if you change the way a coastal ecosystem restoration project is operating, potentially remobilizing previously stored organic carbon, inorganic carbon capture is largely a one-way street,\" said Mojtaba Fakhraee, lead author of the study and former postdoctoral researcher in EAS. \"So even if a massive ecosystem disruption in the future undoes organic carbon storage, the inorganic carbon that has been captured will still be in the ocean permanently.\"      Capturing carbon, counteracting acidityCoastal ecosystems naturally remove carbon from the atmosphere and provide a range of environmental and economic benefits to coastal communities, but many human interventions have caused extensive degradation or destruction of natural coastal environments. Planting more mangroves and seagrasses, maintaining them, and protecting the overall ecosystem can restore their functioning and lead to additional carbon removal from the atmosphere.Reinvigorating coastal ecosystems as a technique for mitigating carbon emissions is not a new idea, but past research has focused on carbon removal through organic carbon burial and has not explored the potential for carbon removal through the formation of inorganic carbon.Another major result of human fossil fuel use beyond climate change is ocean acidification from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dissolving in the water and driving down the pH of the ocean, which can have severe, negative impacts on many organisms like corals. Storing carbon dioxide as inorganic carbon in the ocean could help mitigate this, because the chemical processes that lead to carbon capture as inorganic carbon involves alkalinizing ocean waters.\"The basic idea here is that you are shifting the acid-base balance of the ocean to drive conversion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to inorganic carbon in the ocean,\" Reinhard said. \"This means that the process can help to partially offset the negative ecological consequences of ocean acidification.\"Modeling carbon captureTo explore how effective restoring coastal ecosystems could be for inorganic carbon capture, the researchers built a numerical model to represent the chemistry and physics of sedimentary systems\u2014the complex mixture of solid particles, living organisms, and seawater that accumulates at the sea floor. A key advance of the model is that it specifically tracks the potential benefits of restored mangrove or seagrass ecosystems and their impacts on organic and inorganic carbon cycling. It also calculates the effects of other greenhouse gases, such as methane, that can sometimes be created in the process of restoring mangrove and seagrass ecosystems.\"This model comes up with representations for the rates of carbon transformation in the sediment based on how much mangrove is growing above the sediment,\" said Noah Planavsky, senior author on the study and professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Yale. \"We found that across an extremely large range of scenarios, restoration of blue carbon ecosystems leads to durable carbon dioxide removal as dissolved inorganic carbon.\"The team hopes this research could provide an impetus to protect current coastal ecosystems and economically incentivize restoration of degraded ecosystems, potentially as a new form of carbon offset.\"Companies that are trying to offset their own emissions could potentially purchase carbon removal through funding restoration of coastal ecosystems,\" Reinhard said. \"This could help rebuild these ecosystems and all of the environmental benefits they provide, while leading to durable carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere.\" More information:Mojtaba Fakhraee et al, Ocean alkalinity enhancement through restoration of blue carbon ecosystems, Nature Sustainability (2023).

  "question_squad": " What is the greatest source of uncertainty in predictions of sea level rise?",
  "answer_squad": " melting Antarctic ice",
  "text": "The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is shrinking, with many glaciers across the region retreating and melting at an alarming rate. However, this was not always the case according to new research published last month (April 28) in The Cryosphere.          A team of scientists from the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC), including two researchers from British Antarctic Survey (BAS), discovered that the ice sheet near Thwaites Glacier was thinner in the last few thousand years than it is today. This unexpected find shows that glaciers in the region were able to regrow following earlier shrinkage.Sea level rise is already putting millions of people in low lying coastal communities around the world at risk from flooding. The contribution from melting Antarctic ice is currently the greatest source of uncertainty in predictions of how much and how quickly sea level will rise in the coming decades and centuries. Together with its immediate neighbor, Thwaites Glacier currently dominates the Antarctic contribution to sea level rise.To understand how this important glacier will respond to the climate changes expected in the coming century, scientists need to know how it behaves under a wide range of climatic conditions and over long timescales. Since satellite observations only go back a few decades in time, we need to look at the geological record to find this information.Jonathan Adams, co-author and Ph.D. student at BAS, says, \"By studying the history of glaciers like Thwaites, we can gain valuable insight into how the Antarctic Ice Sheet may evolve in future. Records of ice sheet change from rocks that are presently exposed above the ice sheet surface end around 5000 years ago, so to find out what happened since then, we need to study rock presently buried beneath the ice sheet.\"Using drills specially designed to cut through both ice and the underlying rock, the team recovered rock samples from deep beneath the ice sheet next to Thwaites Glacier. They then measured, in those rock samples, specific atoms that are made when rocks are exposed at the surface of the Earth to radiation coming from outer space. If ice covers those rocks, these particular atoms are no longer made. Their presence can therefore reveal periods in the past when the ice sheet was smaller than present.Keir Nichols, a glacial geologist from Imperial College London and a lead author of the study, says, \"This was a huge team effort: several of us spent weeks away from home doing fieldwork in an extremely remote part of Antarctica, while others endured literally thousands of hours in the lab analyzing the rocks we collected.\"\"The atoms we measured exist only in tiny amounts in these rocks, so we were pushing right to the limit of what is currently possible and there was no guarantee it would work. We are excited that this is the first study to reveal the recent history of an ice sheet using bedrock collected from directly beneath it\"The team discovered that the rocks they collected were not always covered by ice. Their measurements showed that, during the past 5,000 years, ice near Thwaites Glacier was at least 35 meters thinner than it is now. Furthermore, their models demonstrated that its growth since then\u2014making the ice sheet the size it is today\u2014took at least 3,000 years.This discovery reveals that ice sheet retreat in the Thwaites Glacier region can be reversed. The challenge for scientists now is to understand the conditions required to make that possible.Joanne Johnson, a geologist at BAS and co-author of the study, says, \"On the face of it, these results seem like good news\u2014Thwaites Glacier was able to regrow from a smaller configuration in the geologically-recent past. However, our study shows that this recovery took more than 3,000 years, in a climate that was likely not as warm as what we expect for the coming centuries.\"\"If we want to avoid the impacts of sea level rise on our world that will result from continued retreat of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, that timescale is far longer than we can afford to wait.\" More information:Greg Balco et al, Reversible ice sheet thinning in the Amundsen Sea Embayment during the Late Holocene, The Cryosphere (2023).

  "answer_race": " To call on people to focus on real circular economy goals.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the paper published today in Waste Management journal?",
  "answer_squad": " Circularity is not necessarily synonymous with sustainability",
  "text": "In a new paper published today in Waste Management journal, four scientists from Brunel University London, Politecnico di Milano, University of Southern Denmark and Wageningen University & Research remind us that circularity is not necessarily synonymous with sustainability. Therefore, striving to achieve circularity will not always guarantee a sustainable outcome.          Achieving higher circularity of packaging materials, components, and products is now a significant trajectory taken by politicians and businesses to curb the negative environmental impacts caused by packaging life cycles. Circularity has become an established concept in the public debate but still remains a broad notion that needs a precise definition, that goes beyond the use of metrics and indicators that are not fit for purpose or easy to measure such as collection rates, recycling rates, recycled content, biobased content, and so on.Circularity measured with such indicators fails to capture system realities or broader effects, including potential rebound effects that may negate or even overturn environmental benefits.As an example of a meaningful and practical approach, the four researchers Ciprian Cimpan, Eleni Iacovidou, Lucia Rigamonti and Eggo U. Thoden van Velzen propose a product-centric circularity scorecard that captures aspects likely to demonstrate a product's environmental sustainability. It is based on seven simple questions covering the life cycle of a product: production, use and end-of-life. This \"common sense\" approach resembles the waste hierarchy with a simple priority order that holds true in most cases.\"Current actions aiming at achieving circularity may be overly focused on superficial effects and losing sight of true circular economy goals,\" the four researchers argue.\"Our aim is to trigger a scientific discussion on how to best combine scientific knowledge and research on the flows of materials, components and products through society to achieve the broader objective of sustainability, while keeping up with the timelines imposed by the pace of business and policy decisions. That is why we are making a plea for meaningful circularity goals, to avoid that business or policy decisions involuntarily contribute to cementing policy and infrastructure that do not contribute to true sustainability,\" they conclude.In a context where the European Commission is proposing to turn the Packaging & Packaging Waste Directive into a Regulation that would be directly applicable in all EU Member States, it becomes of paramount importance that we do not lose sight of actual circular economy goals.In cases where Member States have initiated new laws on packaging waste, and where the business community is committing to ambitious targets to increase the circularity of their products a meaningful, inclusive and practical circularity that promotes sustainability is crucial.> More information:Ciprian Cimpan et al, Keep circularity meaningful, inclusive and practical: A view into the plastics value chain, Waste Management (2023).

  "text": "Spain's weather agency issued weather warnings for large parts of the country Tuesday as several days of torrential rains following a prolonged drought caused minor flooding.          The heavy rains have mainly affected the southern provinces of Alicante and Almeria which have been hit by several thunderstorms since the weekend.Torrential rains have also lashed Madrid, where several roads were cut on Monday night due to flooding.Flooding also temporarily interrupted traffic along stretches of three of the Spanish capital's 12 metro lines, local officials said.State weather agency AEMET placed most of northern Spain on on alert Tuesday due to the risk of thunderstorms, hail and strong winds.Most of the eastern region of Valencia, which is home to important tourism resorts such as Benidorm, were also on alert, along with parts of central Spain.Experts said the torrential rains\u2014which tend to trickle off instead of seeping into the ground\u2014were insufficient to end the deficit in Spain's water reservoirs.Spain's reservoirs, which store rainwater for use in drier months, were at just 47.5 percent of their capacity during the final week of May, down slightly from 47.7 percent during the previous week, according to environment ministry figures.That is well below the ten-year average of around 68 percent.Spain has registered the driest start to a year since records began, with less than half the average rainfall during the first four months of 2023, according to AEMET.The government earlier this month approved measures worth more than two billion euros to alleviate the impact of the prolonged drought, especially on the agricultural sector.Spain is the European Union's biggest producer of fruit and vegetables, and the world's biggest exporter of olives.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Storms lash drought-hit Spain (2023, May 30)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-storms-lash-drought-hit-spain.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_squad": " A team of researchers",
  "text": "A team of researchers from around the world is urging the international community to recognize the full environmental and health threat of plastics and categorize them as persistent, bio-accumulative and toxic (PBT) pollutants.          In a new Viewpoint published in Environmental Science & Technology the researchers argue categorizing plastics, including micro- and nano-sized particles as PBT pollutants would give governments the tools they need to better manage plastic production, use and recycling.\"We need to wake up the world and understand the risks of these pollutants,\" says University of British Columbia (UBC) ocean researcher Dr. Juan Jos\u00e9 Alava, lead author of the paper that includes researchers from Canada, the United States, Europe, South America and Asia.The call comes ahead of the United Nation's Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution's efforts to create an international, legally binding treaty to combat plastic pollution.\"We live in the age of plastic\u2014the Plasticene,\" says Dr. Alava, principal investigator of the Ocean Pollution Research Unit at UBC's Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries. \"There's plastic everywhere. It is in the ocean, coastal zones and terrestrial environment. It has been found in animals across the globe, human tissues and organs, and deep in the Mariana Trench\u2014the deepest part of our ocean. They don't degrade easily, so they last for many, many years.\"What makes plastics so popular, durable and efficient is also what makes them a hazard\u2014with high durability, long-half lives and low degradation rates, plastics can take up to 2,500 years to biodegrade or break down. Single-use polyethylene terephthalate (PET) water plastic bottles and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic bottles are key examples. Without change, plastics' global ecological footprint is reshaping environmental processes and negatively impacting the oceans.Plastics are prone to accumulation in all organisms, with aquatic animals most at risk of exposure to micro- and nano-sized particle. These particles are toxic to marine animals\u2014they can change gene and protein expression, produce inflammatory responses, affect brain development, and decrease growth and reproduction rates, while also preventing proper feeding and foraging behaviors.      \"It's hugely important to remember that it's not just plastics,\" emphasizes Dr. Gunilla \u00d6berg, co-author from UBC's Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability. \"Many plastic products contain chemicals that in themselves are known to be persistent, bioaccumulate and toxic.\"These plastics, which contain other toxins, can act as a \"Trojan Horse\" in the ocean.\"Organisms often ingest these plastics by mistake, and thus, become carriers of many other chemicals and microorganisms,\" says Dr. Gabriela V. Aguirre-Mart\u00ednez, co-author from the Universidad Arturo Prat in Chile.Even humans ingest these particles through the food we eat. Possible health effect risks are still being studied, but the capacity of plastics to collect in human tissues and organs presents a danger, particularly to members of coastal communities who rely heavily on seafood.\"Plastic particles have been found in the human placenta, in breast milk, lungs and in the colon,\" said Dr. Alava. \"So, the exposure is real. Canada has already banned six types of single-use plastics, but other harmful plastics like PET water plastic bottles need to be eliminated. We need an international effort to really eliminate harmful plastics from the world.\"\"This call ahead of the next round of negotiations of the international legally binding instrument for plastic pollution by the United Nations Environment Program is critical, because access is so restricted that very few from civil society or scientists can be present to highlight that this aspect has not yet been given the necessary attention,\" says Dr. Melanie Bergmann, co-author from the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research.Dr. Alava hopes that one day our ecological footprint will show we switched from plastics to more biodegradable substitutes and green, environmentally friendly materials. \"We should really think about ways we can be ocean leaders, and really have future generations change their perspective on, and consumption of, plastics.\" More information:Juan Jos\u00e9 Alava et al, A Call to Include Plastics in the Global Environment in the Class of Persistent, Bioaccumulative, and Toxic (PBT) Pollutants, Environmental Science & Technology (2023).

  "text": "With a warmer climate creating more humid conditions in the Northeast, extreme precipitation events\u2014defined as about 1.5 or more inches of heavy rainfall or melted snowfall in a day\u2014are projected to increase in the Northeast by 52% by the end of the century, according to a new Dartmouth study.          The findings are published in Climatic Change.\"As climate change brings warmer temperatures, you have more water vapor in the atmosphere, which creates the right conditions for extreme precipitation,\" says first author Christopher J. Picard '23, an earth sciences major and undergraduate researcher in the Applied Hydroclimatology Group at Dartmouth.\"Our findings show that this increase in extreme precipitation will be primarily driven by more frequent heavy rainfall events, not by the intensity of such events,\" says Picard. \"In other words, we expect a large increase in the number of extreme precipitation days, and a smaller increase in the amount of rain on each extreme precipitation day.\"The findings also show that winter and spring contribute most to the projected 52% increase in extreme precipitation in the region by 2070 to 2099, with increases of 109% and 89%, respectively.Through previous research, senior author Jonathan Winter, an associate professor of geography and lead of the Applied Hydroclimatology Group at Dartmouth, and other collaborators investigated how heavy rainfall events in the Northeast have changed historically. By examining data from 1901 to 2014, they found that there was about a 50% increase in extreme precipitation from 1996 to 2014, and that the increase was linked to climate change.\"Building on our earlier work, we were particularly interested in determining how much extreme precipitation is expected to change across the Northeast in the future,\" says Winter.Similar to their other papers, the new study defines the Northeast as Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C.Dartmouth's study found that extreme precipitation increases are projected to be largest in West Virginia, parts of Pennsylvania, central New York, and northeastern Maine, with predominantly smaller increases along the Atlantic coast and south of Lake Ontario.The researchers applied a regional climate model from the National Center for Atmosphere Research to simulate precipitation for a historical period of 1996 to 2005 and future period of 2070 to 2099. Then, they compared their results to simulations of changing heavy rainfall events from other regional climate models, and found that their results are consistent with the other regional climate model simulations, which predict increases in extreme precipitation ranging from 58% to 169%.\"Extreme precipitation events can pose threats to life, property, infrastructure, and the environment,\" says Winter.Previous research has reported how flooding, landslides, and erosion from these events can wash out roads, trigger agricultural runoff of pollutants, and damage recreational areas. \"So, understanding where the flood plain is actually located, having the right sized culverts or green infrastructure in place, and properly designing roads and bridges, are important to managing the extra water that we're likely to encounter in the future,\" he says.

  "text": "Water conflicts are nothing new to the arid West, where myriad users long have vied for their share of the precious resource from California's Central Valley to the Colorado and Missouri rivers.          But few have waded into the legal question playing out in rural Nevada: To what extent can local residents, farmers and ranchers claim the water that is soaking into the ground through the dirt floor of an antiquated, unlined irrigation canal?A federal appeals court recently breathed new life into litigation that has entangled the U.S. government and the high-desert town of Fernley ever since a 118-year-old canal burst and flooded hundreds of homes in 2008.This year the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation began work on a plan to line parts of the 31-mile (50 kilometer) canal with concrete. The canal diverts water from the Truckee River, which flows out of Lake Tahoe in the Sierra, sending it to irrigation ditches supporting alfalfa farmers and livestock ranchers about 30 miles (50 kilometers) east of Reno.However, farmers and ranchers in and around the town of Fenley said the repairs would stop water from leaking that they have used for a century to help fill their wells east of Reno.The government says locals don't have any rights to the water that belongs to U.S. taxpayers. Government experts say the renovation also willl help guard against future canal failures even though they acknowlege it will prevent leaks into the local aquifer used by Fenley's residents.Completed in 1905, the Truckee Canal was the first major irrigation system in the West under the Newlands Reclamation Act signed by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1902.                Water flows through a control gate on an irrigation canal in Fernley, Nev., near Reno on March 18, 2021. A U.S. appeals court has breathed new life into a rural Nevada's town's unusual bid to halt government repairs to an aging, federal irrigation canal that burst and flooded nearly 600 homes 15 years ago. The town of Fernley, area farmers and ranchers in the high desert 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Reno say the renovation that finally began this year might help guard against another failure of the 118-year-old earthen canal. Credit: AP Photo/Scott Sonner, File             The act was named after a Nevada congressman who said the project would \"make the desert bloom\" and attract settlers to places like Fernley, where annual rainfall averages 5 inches (13 centimeters).Similar projects followed across the arid West\u2014many much larger. Construction began in 1903 on the Theodore Roosevelt Dam on the Salt River in Arizona, which Roosevelt himself dedicated in 1911.By then, two dozen projects had been authorized, including one that dammed the Lower Yellowstone River near its confluence with the Missouri to irrigate cropland in Montana and North Dakota.      In Nevada, Fernley and surrounding agricultural users eventually became \"utterly reliant\" on the government-subsidized water, their lawyers say.Evoking a sort of finders-keepers doctrine as old as western expansion, opponents of the canal renovation have argued in state and federal court that they have a right to the water partly because, before the canal burst, no one told them they couldn't.The bureau, the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District operating the canal and various judges generally have agreed the water belongs to U.S. taxpayers.Fernley is attempting to claim a water right that doesn't exist under state or federal law, irrigation district lawyer Benjamin Shawcroft said in recent Nevada Supreme Court filings.                A levee that broke flooding homes and forcing evacuations is shown in the process of being repaired in Fernley, Nev., on Jan. 6, 2008. A U.S. appeals court has breathed new life into a rural Nevada's town's unusual bid to halt government repairs to an aging, federal irrigation canal that burst and flooded nearly 600 homes 15 years ago.

Unusual, heavy winter rain put pressure on the canal system, which experts later determined was weakened by decades of rodents burrowing into the sides.The legal battle over the plans to fix the canal followed.Fernley sought relief in state court last year after U.S. District Court Judge Miranda Du threw out its federal lawsuit, which claimed the government failed to adequately consider alternatives required by the National Environmental Policy Act when it approved a $148 million plan to line 12.7 miles (20 km) of the canal.

  "text": "Just after midnight on April 30, residents near the Salton Sea in Southern California were jolted awake by a magnitude 4.3 earthquake. Dozens of people told the U.S. Geological Survey that they felt the shaking, with a couple locals reporting it was strong enough to knock items over or break dishes.          Less than a minute later, another temblor the same size hit a mile away. Then a third struck just before 1 a.m., and over the next two days dozens of smaller quakes followed.Anytime there's a swarm of earthquakes in their community locals can't help but think about the steam billowing from a dozen geothermal power plants that have sprung up along the Salton Sea's southeastern shore over the past four decades.They wonder, could decades of drilling thousands of feet into the Earth's crust and pumping out boiling brine to make renewable energy be causing some of these quakes? And could drilling and testing in the area by companies rushing to extract lithium needed for electric vehicle batteries be increasing the risk?Those were among the concerns raised by some 50 residents who attended a community meeting May 15 at a Niland elementary school, where they asked a team of researchers about new lithium extraction and geothermal projects underway in the area.\"They always ask about seismicity and earthquakes, and how much of that is natural and how much might be due to geothermal power production,\" noted Michael McKibben, a geology research professor from UC Riverside who helped lead that presentation.Turns out, for a variety of reasons we'll get to soon, that's a tough question to answer in this region.But seismologists say one thing is clear: Anytime we drill thousands of feet into the ground, and monkey around with pressure in the Earth's crust, there's a potential for triggering earthquakes.And a series of even small quakes can trigger temblors on nearby fault lines. That's why seismologists watch closely when swarms happen in this area, since the Salton Sea marks the end of the southern stretch of the San Andreas Fault. Scientists believe that particular stretch of the mighty San Andreas, which hasn't ruptured since 1680, is capable of generating a magnitude 8 quake that could devastate California.\"We know someday it's going to pop,\" said William Ellsworth, a geophysics professor at Stanford University.That's got some people worried about whether energy projects at the Salton Sea could be putting the region\u2014and much of Southern California\u2014at greater risk for a major earthquake.\"I am definitely concerned about this,\" said Jeremy Merrill, who lives in east San Diego County and received email notifications about the recent swarm.\"We are currently predicted to have a major quake in Southern California within the next few decades. And if this accelerates it, that is a huge risk.\"A decade-old study out of UC Santa Cruz found a correlation between geothermal production and spikes in seismic activity around the Salton Sea. But Andrew Barbour, who studies induced quakes as a geophysicist with the U.S Geological Survey, doesn't believe there's scientific consensus on whether swarms have accelerated in the years since companies started to tap the geothermal field.The most comprehensive look at data related to that question is due out this summer, when McKibben's team releases a long-awaited report on the area's geothermal field that will compare more than four decades of seismic activity with local geothermal power production.In the meantime, experts say there are a few things companies and regulators can do to minimize the risks of induced earthquakes, help researchers get a better grasp of those risks, and help prepare the community if temblors happen.But since there's no way to eliminate the risk altogether, scientists say this is one more example of the dilemmas we face as we try to quickly curb climate change without creating a new set of hazards.\"These are tough choices we have to make as a society,\" said Michael Manga, a planetary sciences professor at UC Berkeley who's studied this region.\"We need power, so we're getting geothermal power and the potential for lithium to make batteries. And I guess we're trading that off with the possibility of having induced earthquakes.\"      Risk baked inThe same conditions that make the southern end of the Salton Sea ripe for lithium extraction also make it prime for seismic activity.Multiple fault lines, including the San Andreas, run through the area. Those faults allow magma that's usually trapped a couple dozen miles beneath the Earth's surface, in the thick mantle layer, flow up to the crust. Once there, the magma heats an aquifer of mineral-rich water that sits 4,000 to 12,000 feet underground to more than 500 degrees.Berkshire Hathaway, under its spinoff company CalEnergy, was the first to tap that geothermal brine when it opened a power plant in the area in 1982. Through wells drilled more than a mile deep, super-heated geothermal brine travels under high pressure to a low-pressure tank at the surface. The change in pressure turns some of the fluid into vapor, which drives a turbine that makes electricity.CalEnergy added nine more geothermal plants in the area over the next 18 years. Then, in 2012, San Diego-based EnergySource added one more, bringing to 11 the number of geothermal plants operating on the southeastern edge of the Salton Sea.For decades, after those plants captured steam from the brine, they've sent all the lithium-rich liquid back into the earth. But recently, as demand for lithium has surged, researchers have scrambled to come up with the most efficient way to extract lithium from that brine before sending everything else back underground.That lithium boom attracted a third player to the Salton Sea. Controlled Thermal Resources drilled another well last year and plans to eventually drill as many as 60 to produce geothermal power and capture lithium and other valuable minerals from the brine.For those companies, Ellsworth said smaller earthquakes are actually good for business because they help keep the geothermal field active. But building infrastructure also is very expensive, which means a lot of money would be on the line if any seismic activities were to trigger a big enough quake to damage power plants. So UC Berkeley scientist Manga said he hopes investors are pressuring companies for solid due diligence, which includes finding out as much as possible about the seismic hazards.None of the companies operating geothermal plants in the area answered questions about their calculations or potential steps to minimize risks.Controlled Thermal Resources was the only company to offer any response, with a written statement pointing out how the region is already prone to seismic activity. The company also noted that any well operations are subject to strict permitting and reporting requirements. And, the statement said, \"It is important to note that no earthquakes have been attributed to geothermal production in the 40 years of operations in the Salton Sea geothermal area.\"Experts say that is accurate in a strict sense. But they also said there's no way to know if that's simply due to unique challenges at play in this seismically active area.Gauging the level of riskWhen people raise concerns posed by geothermal activities at the Salton Sea, they often cite the well-documented introduction of quakes in once-quiet places like Texas and Oklahoma due to oil fracking.Any such connection is much tougher to suss out when it comes to local geothermal activity for two simple reasons, according to federal geophysicist Barbour: There's simply too much natural seismic activity already underway in the Imperial Valley and not enough specific, long-term data to sort out the differences.But when it comes to inducing quakes, fracking also is believed to carry a greater risk than geothermal operations due to key distinctions in the different processes.With fracking, companies use deep wells to shoot highly pressurized water, sand and chemicals to split open and widen cracks in underground rock formations, releasing gas or crude oil trapped within those formations. Since that increases pressure underground, Barbour said, it's easy to see why those processes have been linked to spikes in seismic activity.Geothermal operations, on the other hand, are only replacing fluids they previously extracted. So companies like to say they're \"stabilizing\" the Salton Sea's geothermal field when they inject material.However, half a dozen scientists interviewed for this story said all geothermal power operations can induce earthquakes.On the one hand, Ellsworth said removing fluids from the geothermal field should reduce pressure and therefore reduce stress on earthquake faults. But Barbour pointed out some fluid gets lost during the engineering process, which means companies are injecting a lower volume of fluid than they extracted. He said studies have found any reduction in geothermal fluids can cause underground rocks to contract and impact stress on nearby faults.In 2006, Basel, Switzerland experienced a series of quakes, up to magnitude 3.6, shortly after a geothermal plant finished drilling on top of a fault there. Residents protested and the plant was quickly shut down.There's at least one example of a geothermal company operating near the Salton Sea allowing an injection well site to become over pressurized to the point that fluids broke through the crust and made it back to the surface. The incident happened in April 2021, according to emailed responses from the California Department of Conservation. The state agency didn't respond to repeated requests about which operator owned the well, but said that well and others in the area were shut down until extensive safety tests were conducted.Records of that violation, and any others by area operators, don't appear to be posted publicly. The Department of Conservation said violation notices would take some time to compile and weren't available at press time.Along with changes to underground pressure, geothermal companies also are injecting cooled fluids back into the earth, with the temperature often dropping from more than 500 degrees to closer to 100 degrees. The USGS lists such temperature changes as a \"significant factor\" in why Northern California's Geysers Geothermal Field, which experienced its own swarm in April, regularly triggers small quakes that rattle residents in the nearby town of Cobb.While plants there operate a bit differently than the plants at the Salton Sea, with additional wastewater injected into the Northern California geothermal field to restore depleted fluids, researchers said both extract hot materials and inject cooled materials. One notable difference, Ellsworth pointed out, is that the Geysers facility isn't near any major fault lines.In 2013, researchers from UC Santa Cruz released a study showing quake patterns near the Salton Sea mirroring patterns in geothermal energy production. Lead author Emily Brodsky said she hasn't been tracking data from the region since then, deferring to other experts for comment on this story.Several seismologists said that while they didn't dispute the correlation in Brodsky's study, there was some controversy over an observation tacked onto the end of the paper that suggested quake swarms near the geothermal field could trigger a bigger quake along the San Andreas fault.The end of the San Andreas fault is about a dozen miles from where geothermal production takes place, Barbour pointed out. That may not seem far. But he said the southern shore would likely need to see quakes significantly larger than what's on record to date, with peaks in the magnitude 5 range, to set off the San Andreas fault.Minimizing the risksWhile there's no way to eliminate the risk of geothermal operations triggering earthquakes, scientists said there are a few things companies and regulators can do to help.One is to ensure that no one is drilling wells or injecting cooled material directly over a local fault line, Barbour said.Others suggested implementing a \"traffic light\" system for geothermal plants that's similar to what fracking operators must use, where they get alerts if they're injecting materials and raising pressures too quickly.All scientists interviewed for this story said they'd like to see more frequent, comprehensive and and transparent data collection.Right now, companies have to report monthly production and injection rates to the state, with those reports available on the the Department of Conservation's website. But that data is posted a couple months late. To be able to draw a clean line between geothermal operations and particular earthquakes, scientists said companies would need to report that data daily and regulators would need to quickly make it available to the public.As a condition of their permits, geothermal companies also have to install seismic monitors at their sites and include earthquake data in annual reports submitted to state and Imperial County regulators. But the state doesn't have, let alone post, electronic copies of those annual reports, the conservation department said. Hard copies weren't available by press time.Those monitors also are not connected to state or federal earthquakes systems, which track quakes in real time. Public systems have gotten better at determining the size, and location of quakes since they were first installed in the Salton Sea area 91 years ago, Barbour said. But they're still some distance away from injection well sites on geothermal company land. So Barbour said researchers would be able to get a better handle on what's happening if companies were required to share detailed quake data from their on-site monitoring stations.One other step Ellsworth suggested is for the Salton Sea region to establish a fund similar to one set up for residents near the Geysers geothermal plants. There, he said companies pay into a fund locals can tap into if an earthquake in the region causes property damage.None of the companies responded to a request asking if they'd be willing to consider such a move.Weighing the risks vs. benefits here is tough, Merrill said.\"The benefit of increased electric vehicle production is great for the environment, but a major quake has the potential to cause massive damage to critical infrastructure,\" he said. \"I'd probably err on the side of protecting the people who live here in the region as a priority until alternative means of lithium extraction can be developed.\"So far, thanks to recent jolts of public and private funds, the seismic shift underway to turn the Salton Sea into Lithium Valley shows no signs of slowing down.    2023 MediaNews Group, Inc.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "text": "In the not too distant future, California's coastline and its iconic beaches could be washed away, leaving only cliffs behind.          A new U.S. Geological Survey study found from 25% to 70% of California's beaches could erode by 2100 due to rising sea levels caused by global temperature increases and greenhouse gas emissions.Substantial management efforts like dune restoration are necessary to maintain the beaches and prevent catastrophic erosion, the authors of the study said.\"Beaches are perhaps the most iconic feature of California, and the potential for losing this identity is real,\" wrote Sean Vitousek, the lead researcher. \"Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human-management efforts must increase in order to preserve them.\"The U.S. States Geological Survey used two decades worth of satellite imagery of Ocean Beach in San Francisco\u2014combined with models of sea levels rising from 1.6 to 10 feet due to global temperature increases\u2014to estimate how the entire state's coastline will shift in the next century.That range is expected to vary based on the rate and reduction of carbon emissions over time.While it may seem like that reality is in the distant future, the West Coast could see its sea levels rise up to eight inches in the next 25 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Researchers say intervention is needed to preserve the coastline, but California's legislature is reducing funds that would do just that. Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed a $700 million cut from the coastal resiliency fund used to support the shoreline, CalMatters reported. That chunk is part of a proposed $6 billion reduction in climate change programs amid a $22.5 billion statewide deficit.Particular stretches of the California coastline are more at risk of severe erosion, including Point Arena and Humboldt Bay in northern California, Pismo Beach and Morro Bay in central California, and Newport Beach and San Clemente in southern California.The coastal bluff along East Cliff Drive in Santa Cruz is vulnerable to rising sea levels during big storms. Earlier this year, a \"van-sized\" chunk of cliff near Lighthouse Point collapsed into surfer-filled waters.The 2.7-mile promenade of West Cliff Drive in Santa Cruz is also in danger of expedited erosion as well. This winter's seemingly endless rain storms took a toll on the popular cliffside road, and amid the already rising sea levels, community members and local leaders are concerned about its future.\"This was sort of a wake-up call,\" Gary Griggs told the New York Times. He is a professor of earth sciences who has taught at UC Santa Cruz since the 1960s. \"I've never seen this much damage this quickly in my 55 years here. So it's time to step back and say, 'This is what's coming.'\"The city is facing $13 million in repairs for West Cliff after the recent storms, city manager Matt Huffaker said. The city could incur another $1 billion in erosion and other climate-related damage by the end of the century, the New York Times reported.The USGS study is in the process of being peer reviewed and follows up on a 2017 paper from the same researchers that predicted 31% to 67% of beaches in Southern California were in danger of disappearing.Losing California beaches could impact the tourism economy and damage homes and businesses close to the water.A 2009 study from USGS found that 40% of beaches were already experiencing long-term erosion.    2023 MediaNews Group, Inc.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "text": "A California Department of Fish and Wildlife plan to introduce tidal flows into the Ballona Creek wetlands has come to a screeching halt after a judge ruled recently that the agency's environmental impact report on the project failed to adequately account for flood risks.          In a May 17 decision, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James C. Chalfant ordered the agency to set aside its certification of the final EIR for the project because it \"failed to disclose and analyze flood control design parameters\" associated with proposed levees and other infrastructure.In response to four lawsuits filed by environmental groups, Chalfant ordered the agency to suspend any project activity in the 600-acre West Los Angeles ecological refuge and prepare a new \"legally adequate\" environmental impact report \"if it chooses to proceed.\"Despite the setback, state officials said they intend to correct the EIR and move forward with the controversial project, which is sandwiched between Marina del Rey and urban development upstream of Ballona Creek.\"This restoration project remains the best mechanism to revitalize the Ballona Creek wetlands for many future generations of Angelenos,\" said Jordan Traverso, a spokeswoman for the Department of Fish and Wildlife.Combatants on both sides of the issue, however, suggest that a series of recent events left the fate of the wetlands area uncertain.On Thursday, the Supreme Court issued a decision that significantly reduces the scope of the Clean Water Act and reduces the federal government's ability to protect thousands of miles of rivers, streams, creeks and adjacent wetlands throughout the western U.S.The court said the law's protections for the \"waters of the United States\" are limited to wetlands and streams that are directly connected to navigable waterways\u2014a definition that some fret might not include the Ballona Creek wetlands.Separately, Gov. Gavin Newsom a week ago unveiled a proposal aimed at shortening the contracting process for bridge and water projects, limiting timelines for environmental litigation and simplifying the permitting process for complicated developments in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and elsewhere.It remains to be seen how these actions may affect the Ballona Creek wetlands\u2014the focus of one of the longest environmental battles in Southern California history.      In the meantime, opponents of the state project\u2014which was originally scheduled to begin in 2024\u2014say the judge's ruling has provided them an opportunity to press for the withdrawal of what they regard as an ecologically unsound proposal.Chalfant's ruling applies to lawsuits filed against the Department of Fish and Wildlife by Protect Ballona Wetlands, Ballona Wetlands Land Trust, Grassroots Coalition and Defend Ballona Wetlands.\"We welcome the ruling,\" said Marsha Hanscom, a community organizer for Defend Ballona Wetlands. \"It gives the mosaic of habitats at the ecological reserve a reprieve from facing utter destruction and upheaval by state officials who\u2014shockingly\u2014favor sending bulldozers and other heavy equipment into these fragile wetlands.\"She fears that dozens of struggling species, and much of their habitat, would be sacrificed by restoration-related excavation, and the addition of 10 miles of bike paths.Under the state's plan, more than 2 million cubic yards of soil would be repositioned to create earthen levees up to 20 feet high for flood protection from Pacific Ocean tides.Exposing the wetlands to tidal influence would be a mistake, opponents argue, because higher salinity levels could wipe out flora, fauna and habitat that currently rely on seasonal rains and brackish water. Beyond that, they say, it would make the area vulnerable to potentially destructive flooding.In his ruling, Chalfant sided with the petitioners in ordering the state to commit to specific performance criteria in the event that its activities harmed wildlife and habitat.Once owned by industrialist Howard Hughes, the property sits just north of Los Angeles International Airport and is home to ring-necked snakes, great blue herons, South Coast marsh voles and the federally endangered El Segundo blue butterfly.The state paid $139 million in voter-approved bond money in 2003 to buy what was left of the Ballona Wetlands from Playa Capital, the developer of Playa Vista. The deal made the highly degraded expanse of marshes, mud flats and salt pans off limits to development.The restoration project is supported by nonprofit environmental groups such as Heal the Bay, the Bay Foundation, Friends of Ballona Wetlands and David Kay, a former senior manager at Southern California Edison's environmental department.In a recent Patch article, Kay pointed out that Chalfant rejected 24 of the 26 arguments presented in one of the lawsuits. \"The judge's ruling,\" he wrote, \"represents a spectacular failure by the opponents to achieve their long-stated goal of stopping the restoration project altogether.\"Hanscom, however, said Kay misses the point. \"In fact,\" she said, \"the judge gave us what we wanted most: Invalidate the EIR and halt all state work at the reserve.\"\"This fight is far from over,\" she added. \"We're not giving up on defending the wildlife that clings to survival in these precious remnant wetlands.\"    2023 Los Angeles Times.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "question_squad": " What is the process called that removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere?",
  "answer_squad": " carbon dioxide removal",
  "text": "One of the primary drivers of climate change is excess greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Mitigating climate change in the coming century will require both decarbonization\u2014electrifying the power grid or reducing fossil fuel-guzzling transportation\u2014and removing already-existing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a process called carbon dioxide removal.          Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Yale University are proposing a novel pathway through which coastal ecosystem restoration can permanently capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Seagrass and mangroves\u2014known as blue carbon ecosystems\u2014naturally capture carbon through photosynthesis, which converts carbon dioxide into living tissue.\"Mangroves and seagrasses extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere all day long and turn it into biomass,\" said Chris Reinhard, an associate professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences (EAS). \"Some of this biomass can get buried in sediments, and if it stays there, then you've basically just removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\"In May, the researchers presented their research, \"Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement Through Restoration of Blue Carbon Ecosystems,\" in Nature Sustainability.Restoring these ecosystems could potentially benefit local flora and fauna and help to energize coastal economies. But Reinhard and colleagues suggest that restoring them could also remove additional carbon through a novel pathway while combating increasing acidity in the ocean.Carbon 101There are two major types of carbon that cycle through the Earth system: organic carbon and inorganic carbon. Organic carbon is contained in living matter, such as algae, plants, animals, and even humans. This form of carbon can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere temporarily, but if it becomes buried in sediments at the sea floor, it can lead to permanent carbon dioxide removal. Inorganic carbon can also be found in many forms, including rocks and minerals, but is present as a significant dissolved component of ocean water.Roughly 30% of the carbon emitted by human activities since the Industrial Revolution is now stored as dissolved inorganic carbon in the ocean. Although carbon dioxide stored as organic carbon can be disrupted, effectively redistributing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere, carbon dioxide removal by inorganic carbon is potentially much more durable.\"Even if you change the way a coastal ecosystem restoration project is operating, potentially remobilizing previously stored organic carbon, inorganic carbon capture is largely a one-way street,\" said Mojtaba Fakhraee, lead author of the study and former postdoctoral researcher in EAS. \"So even if a massive ecosystem disruption in the future undoes organic carbon storage, the inorganic carbon that has been captured will still be in the ocean permanently.\"      Capturing carbon, counteracting acidityCoastal ecosystems naturally remove carbon from the atmosphere and provide a range of environmental and economic benefits to coastal communities, but many human interventions have caused extensive degradation or destruction of natural coastal environments. Planting more mangroves and seagrasses, maintaining them, and protecting the overall ecosystem can restore their functioning and lead to additional carbon removal from the atmosphere.Reinvigorating coastal ecosystems as a technique for mitigating carbon emissions is not a new idea, but past research has focused on carbon removal through organic carbon burial and has not explored the potential for carbon removal through the formation of inorganic carbon.Another major result of human fossil fuel use beyond climate change is ocean acidification from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dissolving in the water and driving down the pH of the ocean, which can have severe, negative impacts on many organisms like corals. Storing carbon dioxide as inorganic carbon in the ocean could help mitigate this, because the chemical processes that lead to carbon capture as inorganic carbon involves alkalinizing ocean waters.\"The basic idea here is that you are shifting the acid-base balance of the ocean to drive conversion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to inorganic carbon in the ocean,\" Reinhard said. \"This means that the process can help to partially offset the negative ecological consequences of ocean acidification.\"Modeling carbon captureTo explore how effective restoring coastal ecosystems could be for inorganic carbon capture, the researchers built a numerical model to represent the chemistry and physics of sedimentary systems\u2014the complex mixture of solid particles, living organisms, and seawater that accumulates at the sea floor. A key advance of the model is that it specifically tracks the potential benefits of restored mangrove or seagrass ecosystems and their impacts on organic and inorganic carbon cycling. It also calculates the effects of other greenhouse gases, such as methane, that can sometimes be created in the process of restoring mangrove and seagrass ecosystems.\"This model comes up with representations for the rates of carbon transformation in the sediment based on how much mangrove is growing above the sediment,\" said Noah Planavsky, senior author on the study and professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Yale. \"We found that across an extremely large range of scenarios, restoration of blue carbon ecosystems leads to durable carbon dioxide removal as dissolved inorganic carbon.\"The team hopes this research could provide an impetus to protect current coastal ecosystems and economically incentivize restoration of degraded ecosystems, potentially as a new form of carbon offset.\"Companies that are trying to offset their own emissions could potentially purchase carbon removal through funding restoration of coastal ecosystems,\" Reinhard said. \"This could help rebuild these ecosystems and all of the environmental benefits they provide, while leading to durable carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere.\" More information:Mojtaba Fakhraee et al, Ocean alkalinity enhancement through restoration of blue carbon ecosystems, Nature Sustainability (2023).

  "text": "The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is shrinking, with many glaciers across the region retreating and melting at an alarming rate. However, this was not always the case according to new research published last month (April 28) in The Cryosphere.          A team of scientists from the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration (ITGC), including two researchers from British Antarctic Survey (BAS), discovered that the ice sheet near Thwaites Glacier was thinner in the last few thousand years than it is today. This unexpected find shows that glaciers in the region were able to regrow following earlier shrinkage.Sea level rise is already putting millions of people in low lying coastal communities around the world at risk from flooding. The contribution from melting Antarctic ice is currently the greatest source of uncertainty in predictions of how much and how quickly sea level will rise in the coming decades and centuries. Together with its immediate neighbor, Thwaites Glacier currently dominates the Antarctic contribution to sea level rise.To understand how this important glacier will respond to the climate changes expected in the coming century, scientists need to know how it behaves under a wide range of climatic conditions and over long timescales. Since satellite observations only go back a few decades in time, we need to look at the geological record to find this information.Jonathan Adams, co-author and Ph.D. student at BAS, says, \"By studying the history of glaciers like Thwaites, we can gain valuable insight into how the Antarctic Ice Sheet may evolve in future. Records of ice sheet change from rocks that are presently exposed above the ice sheet surface end around 5000 years ago, so to find out what happened since then, we need to study rock presently buried beneath the ice sheet.\"Using drills specially designed to cut through both ice and the underlying rock, the team recovered rock samples from deep beneath the ice sheet next to Thwaites Glacier. They then measured, in those rock samples, specific atoms that are made when rocks are exposed at the surface of the Earth to radiation coming from outer space. If ice covers those rocks, these particular atoms are no longer made. Their presence can therefore reveal periods in the past when the ice sheet was smaller than present.Keir Nichols, a glacial geologist from Imperial College London and a lead author of the study, says, \"This was a huge team effort: several of us spent weeks away from home doing fieldwork in an extremely remote part of Antarctica, while others endured literally thousands of hours in the lab analyzing the rocks we collected.\"\"The atoms we measured exist only in tiny amounts in these rocks, so we were pushing right to the limit of what is currently possible and there was no guarantee it would work. We are excited that this is the first study to reveal the recent history of an ice sheet using bedrock collected from directly beneath it\"The team discovered that the rocks they collected were not always covered by ice. Their measurements showed that, during the past 5,000 years, ice near Thwaites Glacier was at least 35 meters thinner than it is now. Furthermore, their models demonstrated that its growth since then\u2014making the ice sheet the size it is today\u2014took at least 3,000 years.This discovery reveals that ice sheet retreat in the Thwaites Glacier region can be reversed. The challenge for scientists now is to understand the conditions required to make that possible.Joanne Johnson, a geologist at BAS and co-author of the study, says, \"On the face of it, these results seem like good news\u2014Thwaites Glacier was able to regrow from a smaller configuration in the geologically-recent past. However, our study shows that this recovery took more than 3,000 years, in a climate that was likely not as warm as what we expect for the coming centuries.\"\"If we want to avoid the impacts of sea level rise on our world that will result from continued retreat of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, that timescale is far longer than we can afford to wait.\" More information:Greg Balco et al, Reversible ice sheet thinning in the Amundsen Sea Embayment during the Late Holocene, The Cryosphere (2023).

  "answer_race": " To call on people to focus on real circular economy goals.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the paper published today in Waste Management journal?",
  "answer_squad": " Circularity is not necessarily synonymous with sustainability",
  "text": "In a new paper published today in Waste Management journal, four scientists from Brunel University London, Politecnico di Milano, University of Southern Denmark and Wageningen University & Research remind us that circularity is not necessarily synonymous with sustainability. Therefore, striving to achieve circularity will not always guarantee a sustainable outcome.          Achieving higher circularity of packaging materials, components, and products is now a significant trajectory taken by politicians and businesses to curb the negative environmental impacts caused by packaging life cycles. Circularity has become an established concept in the public debate but still remains a broad notion that needs a precise definition, that goes beyond the use of metrics and indicators that are not fit for purpose or easy to measure such as collection rates, recycling rates, recycled content, biobased content, and so on.Circularity measured with such indicators fails to capture system realities or broader effects, including potential rebound effects that may negate or even overturn environmental benefits.As an example of a meaningful and practical approach, the four researchers Ciprian Cimpan, Eleni Iacovidou, Lucia Rigamonti and Eggo U. Thoden van Velzen propose a product-centric circularity scorecard that captures aspects likely to demonstrate a product's environmental sustainability. It is based on seven simple questions covering the life cycle of a product: production, use and end-of-life. This \"common sense\" approach resembles the waste hierarchy with a simple priority order that holds true in most cases.\"Current actions aiming at achieving circularity may be overly focused on superficial effects and losing sight of true circular economy goals,\" the four researchers argue.\"Our aim is to trigger a scientific discussion on how to best combine scientific knowledge and research on the flows of materials, components and products through society to achieve the broader objective of sustainability, while keeping up with the timelines imposed by the pace of business and policy decisions. That is why we are making a plea for meaningful circularity goals, to avoid that business or policy decisions involuntarily contribute to cementing policy and infrastructure that do not contribute to true sustainability,\" they conclude.In a context where the European Commission is proposing to turn the Packaging & Packaging Waste Directive into a Regulation that would be directly applicable in all EU Member States, it becomes of paramount importance that we do not lose sight of actual circular economy goals.In cases where Member States have initiated new laws on packaging waste, and where the business community is committing to ambitious targets to increase the circularity of their products a meaningful, inclusive and practical circularity that promotes sustainability is crucial.> More information:Ciprian Cimpan et al, Keep circularity meaningful, inclusive and practical: A view into the plastics value chain, Waste Management (2023).

  "text": "Spain's weather agency issued weather warnings for large parts of the country Tuesday as several days of torrential rains following a prolonged drought caused minor flooding.          The heavy rains have mainly affected the southern provinces of Alicante and Almeria which have been hit by several thunderstorms since the weekend.Torrential rains have also lashed Madrid, where several roads were cut on Monday night due to flooding.Flooding also temporarily interrupted traffic along stretches of three of the Spanish capital's 12 metro lines, local officials said.State weather agency AEMET placed most of northern Spain on on alert Tuesday due to the risk of thunderstorms, hail and strong winds.Most of the eastern region of Valencia, which is home to important tourism resorts such as Benidorm, were also on alert, along with parts of central Spain.Experts said the torrential rains\u2014which tend to trickle off instead of seeping into the ground\u2014were insufficient to end the deficit in Spain's water reservoirs.Spain's reservoirs, which store rainwater for use in drier months, were at just 47.5 percent of their capacity during the final week of May, down slightly from 47.7 percent during the previous week, according to environment ministry figures.That is well below the ten-year average of around 68 percent.Spain has registered the driest start to a year since records began, with less than half the average rainfall during the first four months of 2023, according to AEMET.The government earlier this month approved measures worth more than two billion euros to alleviate the impact of the prolonged drought, especially on the agricultural sector.Spain is the European Union's biggest producer of fruit and vegetables, and the world's biggest exporter of olives.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Storms lash drought-hit Spain (2023, May 30)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-storms-lash-drought-hit-spain.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_squad": " A team of researchers",
  "text": "A team of researchers from around the world is urging the international community to recognize the full environmental and health threat of plastics and categorize them as persistent, bio-accumulative and toxic (PBT) pollutants.          In a new Viewpoint published in Environmental Science & Technology the researchers argue categorizing plastics, including micro- and nano-sized particles as PBT pollutants would give governments the tools they need to better manage plastic production, use and recycling.\"We need to wake up the world and understand the risks of these pollutants,\" says University of British Columbia (UBC) ocean researcher Dr. Juan Jos\u00e9 Alava, lead author of the paper that includes researchers from Canada, the United States, Europe, South America and Asia.The call comes ahead of the United Nation's Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution's efforts to create an international, legally binding treaty to combat plastic pollution.\"We live in the age of plastic\u2014the Plasticene,\" says Dr. Alava, principal investigator of the Ocean Pollution Research Unit at UBC's Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries. \"There's plastic everywhere. It is in the ocean, coastal zones and terrestrial environment. It has been found in animals across the globe, human tissues and organs, and deep in the Mariana Trench\u2014the deepest part of our ocean. They don't degrade easily, so they last for many, many years.\"What makes plastics so popular, durable and efficient is also what makes them a hazard\u2014with high durability, long-half lives and low degradation rates, plastics can take up to 2,500 years to biodegrade or break down. Single-use polyethylene terephthalate (PET) water plastic bottles and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic bottles are key examples. Without change, plastics' global ecological footprint is reshaping environmental processes and negatively impacting the oceans.Plastics are prone to accumulation in all organisms, with aquatic animals most at risk of exposure to micro- and nano-sized particle. These particles are toxic to marine animals\u2014they can change gene and protein expression, produce inflammatory responses, affect brain development, and decrease growth and reproduction rates, while also preventing proper feeding and foraging behaviors.      \"It's hugely important to remember that it's not just plastics,\" emphasizes Dr. Gunilla \u00d6berg, co-author from UBC's Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability. \"Many plastic products contain chemicals that in themselves are known to be persistent, bioaccumulate and toxic.\"These plastics, which contain other toxins, can act as a \"Trojan Horse\" in the ocean.\"Organisms often ingest these plastics by mistake, and thus, become carriers of many other chemicals and microorganisms,\" says Dr. Gabriela V. Aguirre-Mart\u00ednez, co-author from the Universidad Arturo Prat in Chile.Even humans ingest these particles through the food we eat. Possible health effect risks are still being studied, but the capacity of plastics to collect in human tissues and organs presents a danger, particularly to members of coastal communities who rely heavily on seafood.\"Plastic particles have been found in the human placenta, in breast milk, lungs and in the colon,\" said Dr. Alava. \"So, the exposure is real. Canada has already banned six types of single-use plastics, but other harmful plastics like PET water plastic bottles need to be eliminated. We need an international effort to really eliminate harmful plastics from the world.\"\"This call ahead of the next round of negotiations of the international legally binding instrument for plastic pollution by the United Nations Environment Program is critical, because access is so restricted that very few from civil society or scientists can be present to highlight that this aspect has not yet been given the necessary attention,\" says Dr. Melanie Bergmann, co-author from the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research.Dr. Alava hopes that one day our ecological footprint will show we switched from plastics to more biodegradable substitutes and green, environmentally friendly materials. \"We should really think about ways we can be ocean leaders, and really have future generations change their perspective on, and consumption of, plastics.\" More information:Juan Jos\u00e9 Alava et al, A Call to Include Plastics in the Global Environment in the Class of Persistent, Bioaccumulative, and Toxic (PBT) Pollutants, Environmental Science & Technology (2023).

  "question_squad": " What did Aigbekaen hope to do with the data collected?",
  "answer_squad": " help empower communities",
  "text": "Jovan Aigbekaen was stuck in Friday afternoon rush hour traffic on Route 1 in New Jersey. For most drivers, this would have been a frustrating, if familiar, inconvenience. But for Aigbekaen, it was a chance to grab some data.          By improving mobile measurements of air quality and geolocating them to sites like highways, buildings, parking lots and green spaces, Aigbekaen's research for his Princeton University senior thesis unveils critical information that could help cities become cleaner and more livable. He put the technology through its proof-of-concept stage in suburban central New Jersey.\"This kind of technology gives us new ways to understand our environment and the dynamic interactions of pollution, built spaces and transportation,\" said Aigbekaen. \"It's hard to make decisions about cutting carbon emissions or other pollutants without the technology to monitor and measure them.\"Affixed to the car with four powerful magnets was a metal box containing a suite of solar-powered sensors to measure pollution, noise, temperature and humidity\u2014topped by a camera taking nearly 360-degree images of the car's surroundings.An electrical and computer engineering major with a passion for studying and improving urban spaces, Aigbekaen designed his thesis research to integrate images in new ways with air and noise pollution data, opening possibilities for investigating environmental quality at hyperlocal scales.Many large cities around the world are studded with air quality monitoring stations, but these have limited ability to track dynamic, fine-scale differences in conditions tied to traffic, green space, buildings or industrial facilities. This type of monitoring is also relatively rare in developing countries, Aigbekaen noted.                Jovan Aigbekaen, an electrical and computer engineering major, focused his senior thesis research on developing technology to improve mobile measurements of air quality and geolocating them to sites like highways, buildings, parking lots and green spaces. Credit: Kevin Birch             \"Cities are always changing and evolving, and the sensing nodes, by being in a fixed position, can't really capture that flux and change,\" said Aigbekaen, who also earned a certificate from Princeton's Program in Architecture and Engineering. Aigbekaen grew up in Dracut, Massachusetts, about 30 miles northwest of Boston, and said he was always captivated by the vibrance and varied architecture of the city.      By developing technology to sync images with air quality data, he hopes that future work can provide new insights into what factors lead to poor air quality, noise pollution or heat islands, as well as point to strategies to mitigate these problems. For example, said Aigbekaen, areas near highways or busy roads that also have lots of trees may have lower carbon dioxide levels than similar spaces without vegetation, but these effects need more study.Over two days this spring, he collected around 200 data points on the Princeton campus and in the surrounding area as a proof of concept for integrating visual images with sensor readings, using his friend's car and a University golf cart driven by a Facilities staff member.Along with adapting software to transmit and store the data, Aigbekaen used a computer vision technique called semantic image segmentation to categorize all the pixels of each image as greenery, buildings, sky or vehicles. Then he used computational modeling to assess how well the composition of an image could predict levels of CO2, particulate matter and noise pollution.Even with a relatively small data set as its input, his model was surprisingly effective, especially at predicting CO2 levels, with just a 2.5% average error rate when using all the available image categorizations. The results \"highlighted the utility of this approach\u2014of using all these different environmental metrics for monitoring,\" said Aigbekaen.His advisers on the project were Elie Bou-Zeid, a professor of civil and environmental engineering, and Gerard Wysocki, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering. Last year, Aigbekaen took a course on environmental sensing systems with Wysocki that sparked his interest in the topic.                Aigbekaen used a computer vision technique called semantic image segmentation to categorize all the pixels of each image as greenery, buildings, sky or vehicles. Credit: Jovan Aigbekaen             His thesis builds on previous work by Bou-Zeid and Maider Llaguno Munitxa, a postdoctoral researcher who led the design of the first Mobile Urban Sensing Technology (MUST) kit consisting of low-cost, autonomous air pollution and weather sensors. The research team deployed the kit around New Jersey, New York City and Seoul, South Korea, and created a mobile app allowing easy access to the data.Their original work won an urban technology design award in 2019, but Bou-Zeid paused this line of research for a few years, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, he's keen to enhance the technology's capabilities to glean more actionable information, especially as mobility patterns shift and we transition from gasoline-powered to electric cars. Aigbekaen's work, he said, has built a strong foundation for the project's next phase.\"What we want to do now is not only map the environmental quality in a city\u2014we also want to understand why we are measuring bad air quality or high temperatures,\" said Bou-Zeid, who also investigates the dynamics of urban heat islands. \"And to do that, we need to see the surroundings.\"Aigbekaen also envisions a more compact sensing kit that could even be worn on someone's clothing, coupled with software for real-time visualization of environmental conditions. He thinks the low cost of the technology could help empower communities that have been overlooked by pollution monitoring.\"I think it's important for all communities to be able to assess the state of their environment,\" he said, \"and to have the most accurate information in order to address challenges in a data-driven way.\"Aigbekaen's project involved a number of adaptations to the existing kit, including updating the sensors' microcontroller from one brand to another, then figuring out a workaround for a part that was out of stock.His solution involved using two controllers to relay the data to a cloud storage system. \"He almost had to remake the kit,\" said Bou-Zeid. Upgrading the microcontroller and adding the camera involved a good deal of hardware and software engineering. \"He is confident and creative in solving problems.\" Provided byPrinceton UniversityCitation:Thesis work analyzes air quality on the move (2023, May 30)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-thesis-air-quality.html  This document is subject to copyright.

It's a question that's long puzzled Antarctic researchers, but Te Herenga Waka\u2014Victoria University of Wellington adjunct lecturer Dr. Marjolaine Verret may now have the answer.\"Past data has shown with certainty that the mountains around the McMurdo Valleys held life until 14 million years ago. But we now have evidence that liquid water, the base requirement for life, persisted there for much, much longer\u2014up to about six million years ago.\"Dr. Verret holds a Ph.D. in Permafrost Geochemistry completed at Te Herenga Waka\u2014Victoria University of Wellington's Antarctic Research Centre (ARC), supervised by the ARC's Dr. Warren Dickinson.\"Today, the high elevations of the McMurdo Dry Valleys are among the most inhospitable environments on Earth. But they were once warm and wet enough to support liverworts, mosses, and shrubby trees,\" Dr. Verret says.In a paper published in Nature Geoscience, Dr. Verret explains how studying concentrations of beryllium-10 has enabled scientists to date when the Valleys last held water.\"Meteoric beryllium-10 is formed in the upper atmosphere and delivered to the surface of the Earth through rain. So we analyzed concentrations of this chemical in 64 samples collected from 10 different boreholes in the Dry Valleys.\"Previous studies suggest the Dry Valleys began cooling during the Middle Miocene Climate Transition about 15 million years ago, with plant life disappearing entirely approximately one million years later. From that time onwards it was thought that the high regions of the Dry Valleys remained permanently frozen and arid until the present day.\"Our study provides strong evidence that the climate in the Valleys did not remain stable during this time. We found that water infiltrated the ground until the late Miocene, much later than previously suggested, and the Valleys shifted in intervals between a warm-wet climate and the dry polar aridity we recognize today.\"\"Determining when this landscape became arid is critical to our understanding of the response of glacial systems in Antarctica to changes in surface temperatures. Most importantly, this finding implies the McMurdo Dry Valleys are not a landscape frozen in time\u2014they are much more susceptible to climate change than previously anticipated.\"The samples used in Dr. Verret's research were collected as part of the Friis Hills Drilling Project, led by the ARC's Professors Richard Levy and Tim Naish, GNS Science, and supported by Antarctica NZ.The team collected sediment cores from three locations in the Friis Hills, that were then wrapped and stored in ice-core boxes, before being transported to a \"freezer lab\" at Scott Base where they were X-rayed. All cores were later shipped to and re-examined at an ice-core facility at GNS Science.Professor Levy, who is also the Environment and Climate theme leader at GNS, says the research is the result of the significant long-term collaboration between GNS, Te Herenga Waka, and Antarctica NZ.\"The cores we drilled on the summit of Friis Hills contain valuable insights into the past. Dr. Verret's findings underscore how the ongoing examination of these frozen rocks can help guide and inform our future.\"Dr. Verret agrees. \"Science in Antarctica is all about collaboration, and as such, our finding is an added piece to the complex puzzle about climate evolution in Antarctica.\" More information:Marjolaine Verret et al, Late Miocene onset of hyper-aridity in East Antarctica indicated by meteoric beryllium-10 in permafrost, Nature Geoscience (2023).

  "text": "With technology increasingly embedded in our everyday lives, it is becoming more important to understand space weather and its impacts on tech.          When one hears \"space weather,\" one typically thinks of huge explosions on the sun\u2014coronal mass ejections hurled towards Earth, creating beautiful displays of aurora.However, not all space weather starts at the sun.The volcanic eruption in Tonga in January 2022 was so large, it created waves in the upper atmosphere that constituted their own form of space weather.It was one of the largest explosions in modern history and impacted GPS across Australia and Southeast Asia. As we describe in our new study in the journal Space Weather, the eruption caused a super \"plasma bubble\" over northern Australia that lasted for hours.A truly global positioning systemWhile most people have a GPS (global positioning system) receiver on their devices (such as a satnavs and smartphones), not many know how GPS actually works.In essence, our devices listen to radio signals transmitted by satellites orbiting Earth. Using those signals, they calculate their location relative to the satellites, allowing us to orient ourselves and find that nearby pub or coffee shop.Satellite imagery of Hunga Tonga Volcano eruption. Credit: NASA Earth Observatory image by Joshua Stevens using GOES imagery courtesy of NOAA and NESDISThe radio signals received by our devices are affected by Earth's atmosphere (particularly the layer called the ionosphere), which degrades location accuracy. Common devices are only accurate to within tens of meters.However, new and improving precise satellite positioning systems, used within the mining, agriculture and construction industries, can be accurate to within ten centimeters. The only catch is these systems need time to lock onto their location, and this can take thirty minutes or more.This precise satellite positioning works by accurately modeling the errors caused by Earth's ionosphere. But whenever the ionosphere becomes disturbed, it becomes complicated and difficult to model.For instance, when a geomagnetic storm (a disturbance in the solar wind that impacts Earth's magnetic field) takes place, the ionosphere becomes turbulent and radio waves traveling through it get scattered\u2014like visible light that becomes bent and scattered when looking down into a lake in choppy conditions.How does GPS work?A volcanic disruptionRecent studies have shown the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano eruption caused choppy conditions in the ionosphere that lasted a few days. The size of the waves it generated in the ionosphere were similar in size to those created by geomagnetic storms.While these waves influenced GPS data around the world for days after the eruption, their impact on positioning was rather limited in comparison to another type of disturbance in the ionosphere\u2014a \"super plasma bubble\" that formed in the wake of the eruption.The ionosphere is a layer of Earth's atmosphere at altitudes of approximately 80\u2013800km. It comprises gas with lots of electrically charged particles, which makes it a \"plasma.\"In turn, equatorial plasma bubbles are plasma disturbances in the ionosphere that naturally occur at nighttime above low-latitude regions.Such plasma bubbles occur regularly. They form due to a phenomenon called the \"generalized Rayleigh-Taylor instability.\" It is similar to what happens when a heavy fluid sits on top of a less heavy fluid, and blobs of this lighter fluid rise up into the heavy fluid in the form of \"bubbles\" (see video below).                Disturbance in the GPS signals due to the ionosphere following the eruption. Brett Carter, Author provided             When it comes to disturbances in the ionosphere however, the plasma is also controlled by magnetic and electric fields.As they rise, plasma bubbles form strangely shaped structures that resemble cacti or inverted tree roots. Due to Earth's magnetic field, these structures fan out as the bubble grows above the equator.The result is that higher altitude bubbles reach higher latitudes as well. Typically, plasma bubbles reach a few hundred kilometers above the equator, reaching latitudes between 15 and 20 degrees to the north and south.\u201cClassical\u201d Rayleigh-Taylor instability in fluids.A rare bubble above AustraliaScientists detected a super plasma bubble above Southeast Asia shortly after the Tonga eruption. It's estimated to be similar in size to previously reported rare super bubbles.Earth's magnetic field carried this disturbance south, where it lingered for a few hours above Townsville in northeastern Australia.To date, this is the farthest south any plasma bubble has been observed over Australia. While very rare, such super bubbles are known to have taken place over northern Australia, but they haven't been directly observed before this event.A roll-out of GPS stations across northern Australia has only recently made this type of observation possible.It is understood waves from the volcano eruption disturbed the winds in the upper atmosphere, altering the flow of plasma in the ionosphere and giving rise to the super plasma bubble.

In some cases, getting a lock on the GPS location took over five hours longer due to the plasma bubble.While we understand a lot about the ionosphere, our ability to predict its disturbances is still limited. Having more GPS stations is not only beneficial for improving positioning and navigation, it also fills gaps in monitoring the ionosphere.The Tonga eruption was far from a typical \"space weather\" event caused by the sun. But its impact on the upper atmosphere and GPS highlights the importance of understanding how the environment impacts the technologies we rely on. More information:B. A.

  "text": "New Zealand's 2016 Kaik\u014dura earthquake stopped the Waiau Toa\u2014also known as the Clarence River\u2014in its course. Within hours, the river flooded outside its channel and changed course. In the seven years since the magnitude 7.8 earthquake, the river has completely abandoned the path it used to take.          This is not the first time this sort of thing has happened.Flooding and earthquakes are some of the most frequent natural disasters globally. A great deal of work has been done to understand their risk\u2014but relatively little to determine how they can occur at the same time.This is a problem. Tens of thousands of active faults run under river channels around the world and in New Zealand. In places where faults and rivers intersect, earthquake and river flood hazards are also intertwined.Our new research  shows that when a fault deforms the earth's surface, it can cause an overlying river to suddenly flood outside its established channel. This can put unsuspecting communities at risk.In some cases, the sudden river shifts\u2014also known as avulsion\u2014may even cause the river to establish a new channel within the landscape.There are many examples of this phenomenon throughout history, including the 1812 Reelfoot fault rupture, which dammed the mighty Mississippi river for several hours. The same earthquake also permanently dammed the Reelfoot river, creating Reelfoot Lake.Earthquakes occur due to sudden movement on faults. When a fault ruptures to the surface, it can shift one side of the fault vertically past the other. This can cause a large block of land to be permanently uplifted or depressed.Where faults run under rivers, this vertical movement can produce a fault scarp\u2014a wall of rock and/or soil\u2014that obstructs the river's ability to continue flowing in its usual channel.This is what happened in Kaik\u014dura in 2016. The Papatea Fault ruptured and created a 6.5 meter high barrier within the channel of the Waiau Toa, stopping the river in its course and rapidly and permanently altering the path it takes.But can we predict this sort of thing before it happens?      Forecasting shiftsData from the Kaik\u014dura earthquake offered an opportunity to test whether these sorts of shifts in river flows, and potential flooding, can be \"forecast\" in advance. Turns out, it might be possible.We constructed two flood models that aimed to reproduce the Waiau Toa river shift. The first model used topographic data obtained following the 2016 Kaik\u014dura earthquake, containing the real Papatea fault scarp. The second model simulated the avulsion using pre-earthquake topography, modified with an artificial Papatea fault scarp.Both models performed well, and accurately reproduced patterns of flooding that took place in 2016. This indicates that changes in river flood patterns following surface rupturing earthquakes can be predicted ahead of time.That said, it is impossible to predict the exact amount of surface displacement a fault may produce when it ruptures, or the exact river flow conditions when it does. Instead, flood modeling can be used to explore scenarios ahead of time using historical flow information and historic fault data.Applying this to the Papatea fault rupture, we found that sudden shifts in the flow of the river may not immediately happen if the river is low.Better planningThis is important, as it suggests that flooding could be delayed following a surface rupturing earthquake if the affected river is running low. Yet a river may still change course later, as the flow rate increases.Creating flood models ahead of time may allow planners to identify key zones along the river that are exposed to this hazard. They can then put in measures that will reduce the impact of the flooding, such as levees.New Zealand's position atop a plate boundary means earthquakes are a common natural hazard. Flood hazards are also increasing in frequency and severity .Kaik\u014dura is not the only community that could be affected by the combination of earthquakes and flooding.Many of New Zealand's active faults underlie rivers located near populated areas, or critical infrastructure. Examples include the Wellington fault, which underlies the Hutt River, and the Titri fault and Taieri river intersection which borders Dunedin airport and several towns.Yet we typically do not consider how these rivers may change following a surface rupturing earthquake, meaning nearby populations and infrastructure remain exposed and unprepared. The unique combination of earthquake and flooding is rarely considered in existing flood management strategies or earthquake response plans.It is imperative that existing earthquake response plans consider the influence of active faults that underpin river systems. Current flood models that neglect their presence may underestimate the extent, longevity and patterns of flooding following earthquakes.Our modeling provides a path forward. With some knowledge of fault location and rupture style, the interactions between surface rupturing earthquakes and river flood hazards can be explored ahead of time.

  "text": "Financial compensation should be paid by rich nations for the loss and damage of biodiversity disproportionately affecting the Global South, argue Dilys Roe and co-authors in a Comment piece in Nature Ecology & Evolution.          \"Loss and damage\" is a familiar concept in climate change negotiations: at the 2022 United Nations COP27 climate conference, dedicated arrangements were established to pay for the impacts of climate change in countries of the Global South through direct finance. This concept acknowledges not only the greater vulnerability of those countries to climate change, but also the culpability of rich nations in creating the problem.Roe and co-authors highlight similarities with biodiversity loss, which is driven by habitat loss and over-exploitation of natural systems to meet the consumption demands primarily of the Global North. Like climate change, biodiversity loss is happening everywhere, but the opportunities for destructive expansion of mining, agriculture and deforestation have been predominantly located in poorer nations.For local people, this means loss of resources for food and energy, fewer income opportunities, and losses of territory and of cultural values. The authors discuss how potential economic opportunities for these countries are undermined by historical injustices and power imbalances.The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), and the linked decision on resource mobilization, agreed at the biodiversity COP15 in 2022, specified that countries of the Global North should pay more to halt and reverse biodiversity loss\u2014but it did not discuss compensation. \"Going forward \u2026 there would be a case for countries of the Global South to push for loss and damage-type discussions through the GBF Fund,\" the authors conclude.

  "answer_squad": " volatile organic compounds",
  "text": "Exhaust fumes probably come to mind when considering vehicle emissions, but they aren't the only source of pollutants released by a daily commute. In a recent Environmental Science & Technology study, researchers report that alcohols in windshield washer fluid account for a larger fraction of real-world vehicle emissions than previous estimates have suggested. Notably, the levels of these non-fuel-derived gases will likely remain unchanged, even as more drivers transition from gas-powered to electric vehicles.          Cars' average carbon dioxide emissions have dropped by 25% since the early 2000s, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, but this gas only accounts for part of the total. Another important component of emissions is volatile organic compounds (VOCs), a broad classification of carbon-based molecules that are easily vaporized and that can contribute to ozone formation.While some VOCs are released in exhaust, others may arise from an unexpected source\u2014the products used for \"car care,\" such as windshield washer fluid. Estimates from a national inventory of manufacturer statistics in the U.K. showed that car-care products could be an even greater source of VOCs than exhaust, but these numbers had never been verified experimentally.So, Samuel Cliff and coworkers decided to measure the amounts of vaporized windshield washer fluid ingredients from cars on a real-world road and compare it to the inventory estimates.To measure the VOCs actually emitted by vehicles, the researchers outfitted a van with several instruments, including a mass spectrometer, and parked it near a busy roadway. By comparing the van's measurements with those from a university site with minimal traffic influence, they calculated the average amount of vapor given off per car for each kilometer traveled for several key VOCs.The measured values matched inventory estimates for aromatic compounds that are commonly monitored and regulated, but those for alcohols\u2014key ingredients in windshield washer fluid\u2014far exceeded inventory numbers. In fact, the release of two alcohols, ethanol and methanol, was nearly twice the amount of all VOCs released in exhaust.The discrepancy in alcohol emissions could be accounted for by including solvents from car-care products in the inventory estimations, suggesting that these products are a significant, if unexpected, source of vehicle-derived pollutants. The researchers say that this finding has implications for future regulatory policy especially as drivers transition to electric vehicles, which may have fewer emissions from fuels but will still need clean windshields.

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the Berlin-based climate research institute?",
  "answer_squad": " MCC",
  "text": "How do you make transport in the world's big cities more climate-friendly without putting too much pressure on people? A model-based study of 120 major cities around the globe now shows how these two major goals can be reconciled. Subject to the condition that the quality of life is not allowed to decline in any of these cities, tailor-made climate policy in transport can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 22% in 15 years.          The study was carried out with contributions from the Berlin-based climate research institute MCC (Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change), and published in the journal Nature Sustainability.The researchers used the NEDUM calculation model, which is well established in regional economics. They fed it with data on population densities, land use, dwelling sizes, rents, and transportation costs for each individual city. They then applied four approaches to climate policy in urban transport, namely fuel taxes, efficient cars, investments in public transport or climate-friendly urban development, implementing them both independently and simultaneously.This resulted in two main outputs for each city and each scenario: the climate gas emissions from urban transport, and a value for the inhabitants' welfare. In addition to the material standard of living, the latter also includes a monetary value for the health impacts of traffic including noise, exhaust fumes, accidents, as well as fitness through walking or cycling.Averaging over the 120 big cities studied, climate gas emissions fall by between 4 and 12% over the course of 15 years, depending on the urban climate policy approach pursued\u2014and by 31% if all four approaches are pursued simultaneously. This result in this first step of the study is roughly in line with existing estimates in the research literature. The intermediate result for welfare is rather poor: minus 3% on average. But the point of the new study is that in a second step, the research team built in the constraint that inhabitants' welfare in each city increases at least marginally.Under this condition, i.e. with a view to political feasibility, the calculation model then determined the policy package with the greatest climate protection effect for each individual city. The result was that of the maximum achievable 31% emission savings, 22% can still be realized (with an average 1% increase in welfare).\"So it appears possible to reduce emissions in a welfare-increasing way in each city while achieving most of the global emission reductions,\" says Felix Creutzig, head of the MCC working group Land Use, Infrastructure and Transport, and co-author of the study. \"However, in view of the local specifics, a context-adequate strategy is really needed in each case; there is no one-size-fits-all solution here. This is what makes the upcoming reform of the road traffic regulations in Germany, for example, so significant. Implementation would finally allow municipalities to act flexibly when it comes to climate protection.\"Charlotte Liotta, Ph.D. student at the CIRED research center in Nogent-sur-Marne near Paris and the Technical University of Berlin, is the lead author of the study and adds, \"Our work provides for the first time an analytical framework for developing such context-adequate strategies. And it also highlights the importance of urban transport policies in the fight against global heating.\"An estimated 8% of all global greenhouse gas emissions derive from urban transport. So far, they have hardly been considered in research on regional economics. City policies have also been largely neglected in the Nationally Determined Contributions that are being used in climate diplomacy to find a way out of the crisis.

  "text": "Imagine when you take out leftover food and throw it away, and a volunteer in front of the bucket tells you to separate the waste. If you have two options, one is to do it by yourself, and the other is not to sort the waste or even to give it to the volunteer for sorting. If the volunteer were a stranger, which one would you choose? If the volunteer were a friend, which one would you choose?          Although the increasing amount of waste threatens human well-being and the environment, participation rates in waste separation and recycling remain low without volunteer supervision. In the absence of improved laws and regulations, residents are reluctant to cooperate with volunteers in waste separation. The study focused on a key question that urgently needs to be addressed for effective waste separation. What types of volunteers (familiar or unfamiliar; elderly, young adults, or children) are more effective in promoting cooperation between residents and volunteers?In view of this, Drs. Liu Pingping and Zhang Xuan led by Han Buxin from the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have investigated the effects of familiarity and age on residents' cooperation, as well as the mediating roles of reputation concern and social distance. The study, titled \"Familiarity Promotes Resident Cooperation with Volunteers in Waste Separation\" was published in Acta Psychologica Sinica on May 12.They found that familiarity strongly promotes cooperation. People cooperate more with the high-familiarity volunteers than with the low-familiarity or unfamiliar volunteers. When age and familiarity interacted to influence the cooperative intentions, participants cooperated more with older volunteers in the low-familiarity condition.When social distance and reputation concern were simultaneously treated as mediators in the multiple mediation models, the indirect effect of social distance and reputation concern was significant. Social distance and reputational concern play a serial mediating role in the effect of familiarity on cooperation.The researchers suggest a causal relationship between familiarity with volunteers and residents' cooperation in the field of waste separation.The results show that helping residents to become familiar with volunteers beforehand, or recruiting people who are familiar with residents as volunteers, could promote waste separation and help residents form this habit. Social distance and reputation concerns play serial mediating roles in the effect of familiarity on cooperation.This study provides suggestions and scientific support for the practice of waste separation and saving management costs.

  "text": "A tree is not just a tree. It is also fuel, paper, furniture, livelihood, and industry.          It is a living organism rooted in an ecosystem of fauna, flora, environment, climate, and humanity. Deryn Graham asked an environmental ecologist, an environmental lawyer, a social ecologist, and an accountant what happens when conflicting priorities collide and potentially compromise trees, woodland, and forests.Fuelwood subsidizes Eskom\"The use of fuelwood as a main source of energy in rural communities is relieving Eskom of an enormous additional amount of pressure on the national grid.\"The is according to Wayne Twine, Associate Professor in the Wits School of Animal, Plant and Environmental Sciences and Director of the Wits Rural Knowledge Hub at Wits Rural Campus in Mpumalanga.Fuelwood is wood that is harvested from forestlands and combusted directly for usable heat.Even as the country endures the single longest period of consecutive days of loadshedding, and as people look for alternative power sources for their homes, many would consider the use of fuelwood as a highly undesirable practice. This is based on concerns around environmental sustainability and human health, especially that of women who bear the brunt of the cooking responsibilities.However, using a very conservative estimate based on the use of fuelwood for the cooking of only one meal per day, and excluding boiling water, for example, for bathing, Twine contests that the use of fuelwood is sparing the national grid approximately 543 MW at peak use and 210 GWh per year. This equates to a saving of approximately R200 million per year in energy generating costs for Eskom.Despite the successful roll out of electrification in many rural communities across the country, the cost for indigent households of switching on appliances, especially energy-intensive stoves, is prohibitive, and so the use of fuelwood persists.At best, the harvesting of wood from communal land is managed by local chiefs, and is restricted to dead wood [dry, brittle, dead tree branches] only, but in many areas, the deadwood is depleted, and people resort to foraging from live wood sources.\"If the alternative is drawing more energy from Eskom's coal powered units, we are in any case using up valuable natural resources. Damned if we use fuelwood and damned if we revert to mains electricity, which similarly depends on the burning of fossil fuels,\" says Twine.While burning fuelwood is not desirable, Twine believes that it will remain an important part of the energy mix in South Africa for probably the next 20 years.\"The challenges and solutions are complex,\" he says. \"In acknowledging the reality of the costs and availability of electricity for poor rural communities, we must work towards ensuring that programs aimed at empowering communities to use the resources which natural ecosystems provide to these households more sustainably, are supported and expanded.\"      Not seeing the wood(land) for the treesIn 2019, a German/Dutch-funded study led by Jean-Francois Bastin and Thomas Crowther of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Z\u00fcrich, claimed that there were huge benefits in tree planting projects across the globe, including on large tracts of land in Africa.However, many large tracts of land in Africa are not historically woodland in the first place. A woodland is an area covered in trees. Woodland is distinct from a forest, which has a largely closed canopy forged from the branches and foliage of trees interlocking overhead.Tree planting programs were recommended following the Bastin/Crowther study and several African countries, desperate for funding, listened\u2014even going as far as to introduce alien species. For example, in Madagascar, restoration often involves planting eucalyptus trees, which are non-indigenous. In 2019, Ethiopia embarked on a project to plant 20 billion trees by the end of 2022, with potentially disastrous effects on water supplies and land availability for agriculture.While erroneous on many levels, this study at least served to mobilize African scientists into very vocal opposition, and to work together to formulate a regional plan for Africa's own response to climate change. This response included a Wits University-led Future Ecosystems for Africa study, launched in 2022, which seeks regional solutions for regional challenges.\"The methods and results of the [Bastin/Crowther] study were both incorrect and misleading and therefore potentially dangerous for the continent. Africa has many different ecosystems and to suggest that tree planting is the panacea for global warming is irresponsible. The science is wrong and even if we covered the entire continent in trees, the amount of carbon cited in the Bastin study will never be captured,\" says Professor Sally Archibald, an ecologist in the Wits School of Animal, Plant and Environmental Sciences (APES). \"As African scientists, we must mobilize to make our voices heard in situations where global policies/science undermine what our own research is showing us.\"Such mobilization and rebutting scientific inaccuracy is already evident from Nicola Stevens, a Wits alumna and affiliate based at the University of Oxford's Environmental Change Institute, who is part of a team working on novel, constructive ideas to manage African ecosystems, in particular the African savanna. Together with Ghanaian Mohammed Armani, Stevens mobilized a community of African ecologists to provide an evidence base for identifying climate mitigation actions that are appropriate for African ecosystems.This is the first time that such an evidence base has been produced, and it has already provided inputs to the African Group of Negotiators at the climate COP27 meeting held in November 2022. Suggestions include recognizing that not disturbing Africa's carbon rich soil is an imperative.\"It is important to plow and cultivate in areas that can support agricultural activity and to preserve grasslands whose soil carbon has a vital role to play in the fight against global warming,\" says Archibald.                Women carrying firewood. Credit: Wits University             The need to manage grazing systems and balance stock levels as part of soil management measures was part of the findings. Included in the recommendations were ensuring that mangroves and tropical forests\u2014which capture significant levels of carbon\u2014are not destroyed, as well as ensuring proper fire management programs in forested areas.The REDD+ Program benefits landowners in Africa when they do not cut down trees. REDD+ stands for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation, while the plus signifies the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.However, there is no REDD+ program equivalent to compensate for preserving grassland, which traps carbon in its soil. Biodiversity offset legislation needs to be drafted to protect all our important ecosystems.Properly managed, our African forests, savanna and other environments can greatly assist in mitigating the problem of carbon emissions\u2014to which Africa, as a continent, has contributed the least. Most importantly, this can be achieved without disrupting the natural balance of our rich biodiversity systems.Save the trees, harness hydro, and feed the nationIn 2010, the World Economic Forum defined energy poverty as the lack of access to sustainable modern energy services and products. Energy poverty results from a lack of adequate, affordable, reliable, quality, safe and environmentally sound energy services to support development. There are various solutions aimed at addressing energy poverty in Africa, but not all solutions are sustainable for individual countries, the continent, or the planet.Tracy-Lynn Field, Professor of Law at Wits, holds the Claude Leon Foundation Chair in Earth Justice and Stewardship. She says, \"Solving the energy needs of a country and ensuring environmental protection should not be a mutually exclusive exercise. It requires critical thinking to find answers to both issues.\" Clearly, it's a delicate calibration to combat energy poverty while preserving natural resources.Field, whose research areas include environmental law, human rights, mining law, climate change law and water law, recently collaborated with Dr. Jonathan Muledi, Associate Professor at the University of Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), to study public and private liability for deforestation, forest degradation, and biodiversity loss in the DRC.The DRC hosts Africa's largest expanse of tropical rainforest (and the world's second largest after Brazil), making it a critical part of the climate change equation. Although the rate of deforestation in the DRC has not been as rapid as in Brazil, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has reported that the pace of deforestation has increased significantly, largely due to extensive land clearance for agricultural development to meet the food demands of an ever-growing population.Understanding the economic value of the forest resource and its ecosystem and the amount of carbon storage it represents, as well as the drivers of deforestation, are important considerations in a liability discussion. Direct drivers include unregulated artisanal logging for wood fuel, charcoal production, building and construction; forest clearing for subsistence and commercial agriculture; commercial logging for export; and artisanal and commercial mining.The DRC has also recently opened bids for oil and gas concessions in forested areas. Indirectly, poor governance and corruption also play a significant role in abetting the unsustainable use of the DRC's forest resources.\"There are a number of international and national laws that could be used to protect the forests of the DRC in a manner that allows for the DRC populace and future generations to continue to benefit from the country's forest resources. But these laws are likely to have little effect unless the elephant in the room\u2014the DRC's low rate of access to modern energy services\u2014is addressed,\" says Field.The most obvious alternatives to wood fuel and charcoal production would be to harness the DRC's massive hydropower potential, which would allow the country to meet domestic energy demand and have additional capacity to export to other African countries, including South Africa. But the Grand Inga scheme, which would potentially see the generation of 40,000 megawatts of power, has been beset by funding and contractual issues for many years.\"Wood fuel from the DRC's primary forests is not a renewable resource. Water is. Addressing energy poverty in the DRC by developing sustainable hydropower and non-hydropower renewable energy is imperative if the global community is serious about protecting the forests of the DRC,\" says Field.Counting on climate change reporting protocolsWhen two professors of Accountancy in the University's Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management embarked on a 1,100km paddle down one of the Amazon River's largest tributaries, at least one of them knew what he was in for.Fifty years ago, as a 22-year-old, Professor Kurt Sartorius undertook the same trip to Brazil, which left him almost broken. So why again now, and why did Professor Wayne Van Zijl think it might be a good idea to join Sartorius and his son, Benn?\"We wanted to raise awareness of the impact on climate change of the extensive deforestation of the Amazon rainforest,\" says Sartorius. \"But our objective was a little more focused than simply the message around the damage that is being done by both commercial enterprises and local subsistence farmers. Most of us with any level of awareness already know what is happening to vast tracts of immensely ecologically sensitive areas of our planet.\"The destruction of the Brazilian rainforest is two-fold: Firstly, from commercial enterprises, and secondly from the slash-and-burn land clearance by locals to make room for subsistence cultivation. As the large multinationals clear more and more land, so the subsistence activities move further inland and the two leapfrog each other, encroaching ever further into the deep forest. The Amazon rainforest ecosystem is critical for the entire planet's weather patterns and so its preservation and better management is vital.In the context of their work as accountants, Sartorius and Van Zijl are trying to bring about change in the business and investment world, by introducing reporting protocols and standards that take into consideration climate change mitigation and off-set measures that large corporations are beginning to integrate into their business practices. Are extractors of Brazilian wood and minerals re-investing in community development? Are they assisting with the transition to smarter farming methods and education that improves local knowledge and farming practices?The bottom line is that for Sartorius and Van Zijl, the corporate reports of companies cannot be about the financial bottom line only and must take into consideration companies' social and environmental assets, liabilities, generation, and consumption. Companies that are looking at more environmentally friendly ways of mining, and which are spending money on remediating and repairing damage caused by their extraction methods, will show less profit, but ultimately should be more attractive to investors.\"We cannot reward companies based solely on enormous profits,\" says Van Zijl. \"Sustainability reporting must be accelerated, and this is what we were trying to bring to the sector's attention. As accountants, we also have a role to play in mitigating the impact of climate change by providing environmental information for investors and society to hold companies accountable for their commercial activities.\"Responsible investing requires setting reporting standards that can be used to assess the overall \"value\" of a company, not just value to its shareholders, but its value to society and to the planet.

  "text": "Continued extreme heat exposure is affecting the health of vulnerable groups in communities.          With extreme heat conditions increasing because of climate change, Wits scientists have been among the experts who have been sounding the alarm on the sometimes deadly impact of heat exposure on humans.According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), health is one of the areas on which increasing temperatures in Africa will impact. Mortality and morbidity (death and disease) will increase with further global warming of above 2\u00b0C, which will also increase the distribution of vector-borne diseases, mostly in west, east and southern Africa. Vector-borne diseases are infections transmitted by the bite of infected arthropod species, such as mosquitoes and ticks.High-risk humansWhile the impact of the high ambient temperatures has, over the years, been highlighted as an environmental crisis, there has also been growing concern over how human lives have been affected by the hot weather conditions.Although all humans living in regions in Africa have experienced heat waves, some have had life-threatening reactions that are suspected to have been triggered or exacerbated by the heat. These vulnerable groups include those on chronic medication, people with cardiovascular disease, pregnant women, the elderly, infants, people with disabilities, and outdoor workers.Research Professor at the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute (Wits RHI), Matthew Chersich, says that scientists have observed concerning summer heat that has been rising over the years, particularly in low-to-mid-latitude regions, places with humidity-enhanced heat stress, and regions that experienced extreme dry heat with temperatures of up to 40\u00b0C or more.Human beings operate in a specific thermal niche, Chersich says, with a set of physiological thresholds\u2014or hard biophysiological limits\u2014that correspond to thermal comfort, heat stress, organ system compromise, and death.\"Deadly heat arises when conditions of air temperature and humidity surpass the physiological threshold for human adaptability. Core body temperatures can reach lethal levels under sustained periods of apparent temperatures of 35\u00b0C or more,\" explains Chersich.      The hardest hit by heatDue to these temperatures, excess deaths and hospitalizations have increased over the years, with the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) reporting that while African statistics in heat emergencies are scarce, and only eight out of the 196 events that were reported globally came from the continent.South Africa officially reported 11 deaths related to severe heat but researchers studying excess deaths through temperature correlations found very high mortality burden associated with warmer weather.\"Excess deaths during extreme heat events occur predominantly in older individuals and are mostly related to the cardiac and respiratory systems,\" says Chersich. \"Higher temperatures, especially marked heat fluxes, increase asthma, pneumonia episodes and pneumonia-related mortality, and may compound the impact of air pollution.\"Less severe heat-exposure outcomes\u2014such as lethargy, headaches, rashes, and cramps\u2014negatively affect children in school and play environments. Under extreme heat conditions, hospitalizations and trauma center visits increase for fluid replacement, renal failure, urinary tract infections, septicemia, general heat stroke, as well as unintentional injuries.A hot topic for awarenessDr. Albert Manyuchi in the Global Change Institute (GCI) at Wits explains that while communities had been experiencing extreme heat conditions, and the health effects obvious in relation to diseases, the effects of heatwaves are poorly understood. Yet, despite poor understanding of the effects of heatwaves, communities have found ways to manage in those conditions.\"In Agincourt, where we assessed the current knowledge of heat health effects on human health, we found that community perceptions on heat impacts on health were mainly related to illnesses and diseases, with no understanding of mortality risk,\" says Manyuchi. \"We also found that although healthcare workers were aware of how to manage the health-related effects from the heat, more awareness campaigns that encompass the full range of heat-health impacts are needed to reduce vulnerability, morbidity and mortality,\" he added.Agincourt [Matsavana] and Acornhoek [Khenhuk] are towns in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, and home to the Wits Rural Campus where more than 30 surrounding villages and 21,000 households comprising some 120,000 individuals have participated in public health and health transitions research since the late 1980s.Dearth of heat-health dataThe study by Manyuchi and Chersich, published in the South African Journal of Science on extreme heat events, high ambient temperatures and human morbidity and mortality in Africa, found that there is an urgent need to develop heat-health plans and to implement interventions in Africa.Manyuchi says their systematic review found gaps in early warning systems and that community communication needs to be more accessible and the language understandable.\"Africa is not prepared to adequately deal with the rising temperatures that we are going to face in the future. The weaknesses in health systems mean they are not able to respond to climate-related crises adequately. Observation systems need to be in place and consistent capturing of data needs to be done,\" says Manyuchi.Plan for heat wavesChersich says that although strides are slowly being made to prioritize health in addressing climate change, many underlying health and social systems need to change. Furthermore, the rapid rate at which weather systems are changing has also contributed to the lack of preparedness in African countries.According to him, a more targeted approach, where a package of selected interventions is implemented, may be a more effective option than trying to improve the overall health system, and more attractive for policy makers and funding agencies.\"Preparing for heat waves is an important first step. This involves creating national or regional early warning and information systems, heat wave plans and guidelines, and raising public awareness through campaigns,\" says Chersich.\"Key actions from the health sector include providing dedicated public cooling shelters, securing the availability of clean water and simple water purification systems in low-income settings, surveillance of heat-related diseases, outreach to vulnerable populations, and extended hours for public pools or other water bodies.\" More information:Albert E.

  "answer_race": " The talks on plastic pollution in Paris.",
  "question_squad": " What is the goal of the talks?",
  "answer_squad": " to reach by next year a historic agreement covering the entire plastics life cycle",
  "text": "Countries grappling with the \"immense\" task of ending plastic pollution began a new round of talks in Paris on Monday, amid protests and warnings of the urgency to act.          Representatives of 175 nations with divergent ambitions met at the UNESCO headquarters with the aim of making progress towards reaching by next year a historic agreement covering the entire plastics life cycle.As the talks opened, the head of the negotiations, Gustavo Meza-Cuadra Velazquez of Peru, said the challenge was \"immense, as we are all aware here, but it is not insurmountable\".\"The world's eyes are on us,\" he said.French President Emmanuel Macron urged participating nations to put an end to a \"globalized and unsustainable\" production model, where richer countries export plastic waste to poorer ones.\"Plastic pollution is a time-bomb and at the same time already a scourge today,\" he said in a video message, adding that the materials, based on fossil fuels, posed a risk to global warming goals as well as to biodiversity and human health.He said the priorities of the negotiations should be first to reduce production of plastics and to ban \"as soon as possible\" the most polluting products like single-use plastics.The stakes are high, given that annual plastics production has more than doubled in 20 years to 460 million metric tons, and is on track to triple within four decades.Two-thirds of this output is discarded after being used once or a few times, and winds up as waste. Less than 10 percent is recycled, while more than a fifth is dumped or burned illegally.Environmental groups have raised concerns about the influence of industry lobbying on the talks, with protests outside the venue on Monday carrying signs saying \"Kick industry out\".                Vast quantities of plastic waste have overwhelmed countries' ability to dispose of it.             \"What do we want? Global plastic treaty! When do we want it? Now!\" protesters chanted.In nature, microplastics have been found in ice near the North Pole and in fish navigating the deepest recesses of the oceans.In humans, microscopic bits of plastic have been detected in blood, breast milk and placentas.Plastic also contributes to global warming, accounting for 3.4 percent of global emissions in 2019, according to the OECD.'Gushing pollution'In February 2022, nations agreed in principle on the need for a legally binding UN treaty to end plastic pollution around the world, setting an ambitious 2024 deadline to reach an agreement.Policy actions to be debated during the talks include a global ban on single-use plastic items, and production caps on new plastic production.Delegates in Paris have to narrow down what elements should be included in the eventual draft treaty text, though technical debates had already slowed down the schedule on Monday.Environmental groups are concerned the treaty may not include targets to reduce overall plastic production.Reduction of plastic use and production is part of a plan by the High Ambition Coalition of some 50 nations led by Rwanda and Norway, and including the European Union, Canada, Chile and \u2013- as of a few days ago\u2014Japan.                Graphic showing two scenarios of modelled short-lived plastic flows.             But many countries are reluctant to aim for absolute cuts in production, insisting that recycling and improved waste management are the answer.These include China, the United States, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries, all of which have large petrochemical industries.The head of the UN Environment Programme, Inger Andersen, told the delegates that a throwaway plastic culture was \"gushing pollution galore, choking our ecosystems, warming the climate, damaging our health\" and that the most vulnerable were the hardest hit.To applause, she added: \"We cannot recycle our way out of this mess\".      'Sprint'The Paris meeting, which runs to June 2, is the second of five sessions in the process.One more meeting will be held this year and two in 2024 before the treaty is set to be adopted by the middle of 2025, said Jyoti Mathur-Filipp, executive secretary of the negotiating committee, adding that it would be a \"sprint\".Organizers said limited space at the venue was causing the access limitations, adding that there were some 612 organizations listed to attend in total, with around 40 linked to business.Campaigners kept the pressure on over access to the venue during the day.Tweeting a picture of a group of around three dozen campaigners, the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) called for greater public participation in the process.\"We will not be silenced!\" said CIEL's Jane Patton, adding that fewer than a third of those pictured had been allowed into the venue.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Plastic pollution: Treaty talks get into the nitty-gritty (2023, May 29)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-plastic-pollution-treaty-nitty-gritty.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the stream that moves in the tropics?",
  "answer_squad": " Hadley cell",
  "text": "In the tropics, above the equatorial rainforests and oceans, the strong solar radiation hitting Earth propels a stream of warm, moist air far upward.          Once reaching the upper atmosphere, this stream moves in both hemispheres toward the poles; it then descends in the subtropical regions at around 20 to 30 degrees latitude, contributing to the creation of massive deserts like the Sahara in northern Africa. From there, the stream\u2014known as the Hadley cell\u2014returns to the equator, where it heats up and rises again, embarking on its circular journey anew.The two Hadley cells\u2014the northern and the southern\u2014circulate most of the heat and humidity across low latitudes, greatly affecting the global distribution of climate regions. When the warm, moist air rises, it cools down, allowing water vapor to condense, which leads to heavy rainfall deep in the tropics.In contrast, the streams of air that descend toward the Earth in subtropical regions are accompanied by warm, dry winds that reduce rainfall. In essence, the Hadley cells determine which regions in the tropics and the subtropics will have arid deserts and which will be blessed with abundant rainfall. Israel is located on the margins of the northern Hadley cell, which contributes to the country's semiarid climate.Because of their huge significance, the Hadley cells are of great interest to climate scientists. However, while there is plenty of global data about rainfall and temperature, measuring airflow throughout the atmosphere is next to impossible. Adding to the quandary, the various models seeking to make sense of the Hadley cells have been found to contradict one another.Global climate models, which are used for climate projections, indicate that the northern Hadley cell has weakened over the past few decades, whereas observation-based analyses suggest the exact opposite.                A band of clouds above the equator, created by the rise of air within the Hadley cell and responsible for heavy rainfall in this region. Credit: Weizmann Institute of Science             An uncertainty over a system that is so essential to Earth's climate detracts from the researchers' ability to assess how much humans have contributed to recent climate change. This, in turn, undermines the credibility of climate projections, making it ever harder to formulate policies required for dealing with the climate crisis. The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the most important document in the field, makes a special point of this issue.      In a paper published in Nature, Dr. Rei Chemke, of the Earth and Planetary Sciences Department at the Weizmann Institute of Science, and Dr. Janni Yuval, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, address the uncertainty that has plagued the existing models for the past two decades. They propose an observation-based method for measuring the intensity of airflow in the Hadley cells.To tackle the challenge, Chemke and Yuval looked for readily available data they could use to formulate a new way of measuring the cells' intensity. After examining physics equations describing airflow, they identified a relationship between the Hadley cell intensity and a constantly monitored parameter: air pressure at sea level.They then examined observational data collected over several decades and reached the conclusion that the intensity of the northern Hadley cell has indeed been weakening\u2014just as suggested by global climate models. Moreover, they were able to show with a high level of certainty that this weakening has been the result of human activity and will likely continue in the future.What, then, is to be expected? Over the coming decades, the weakening of the northern Hadley cell is likely to mitigate the projected precipitation changes at low latitudes. It will act to temper both the increase of rainfall in equatorial regions and the reduction of rainfall in the subtropical regions. This tempering, however, might only reduce, but not overcome, the projected aridification and desertification of Israel.\"Our study shows that human activity is already affecting key global climate phenomena,\" Chemke concludes.\"This research also improves the confidence that can be placed in climate model projections and helps us deal more accurately with climate change. In our follow-up study, we will examine whether a similar weakening in the Hadley cell has happened in the past thousand years owing to natural phenomena\u2014and that will allow us to assess how unprecedented these human-induced changes are.\" More information:Rei Chemke et al, Human-induced weakening of the Northern Hemisphere tropical circulation, Nature (2023).

  "text": "Alkaline hydrothermal systems are considered ideal environments for the origin of life because they can provide ideal ion gradient conditions for the formation of early life on Earth.          However, alkaline hydrothermal vents have only been found in the Lost City hydrothermal field in the Atlantic Ocean. Additionally, accurately obtaining the in-situ pH of high-temperature hydrothermal vent fluids is a challenge.Recently, a research team led by Prof. Zhang Xin from the Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IOCAS) and their collaborators from the University of Science and Technology Beijing constructed an in-situ pH measurement method for high-temperature hydrothermal fluids based on the self-developed Raman insertion Probe (RiP) system.They applied it to the measurement of arc-back arc (ABA) hydrothermal systems and revealed that the in-situ pH of high-temperature fluids in the sediment-host hydrothermal systems is alkaline. The study was published in Geophysical Research Letters on May 10.The researchers used a deep-sea extreme environment simulation platform to conduct quantitative analysis of the H2S-HS- ion equilibrium system. They established Raman quantitative analysis models for H2S and HS- under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions, as well as an in-situ pH calibration model for hydrothermal fluids.They focused on a typical hydrothermal system in a back-arc setting and conducted in-situ detection using the ROV Faxian equipped with RiP. The observations revealed that the in-situ pH value of the high-temperature vent (6.3) exceeded the pH value of neutral fluids at the same vent temperature and pressure (5.6), indicating weak alkalinity. The in-situ pH value was approximately 1.5 units higher than the measurements conducted at room temperature.\"This study confirmed that alkaline hydrothermal vents not only exist in hydrothermal areas like the Lost City, which are controlled by serpentinization reactions, but may also be widely distributed in hydrothermal areas near continental margins affected by significant sedimentation,\" said Li Lianfu, first author of the study.

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the university in Finland that conducted the study?",
  "answer_squad": " IMT Atlantique",
  "text": "Work recently published in the journal Chemosphere has documented the presence of large amounts of highly radioactive, poorly soluble cesium rich micro-particles (CsMPs) in an abandoned school building close to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP).          The microparticles penetrated the building during the FDNPP nuclear accident of March 2011. They could pose a threat to human health if inhaled. The study shows that indoor CsMPs should be considered in safety assessments and in building clean-up efforts.The study involved scientists from Japan (Kyushu University), Finland (The University of Helsinki), France (IMT Atlantique, University of Nantes), and the U.S. (Stanford University), and was led by Associate Professor Satoshi Utsunomiya and graduate students Kazuki Fueda and Tatsuki Komiya (Department of Chemistry, Kyushu University).In recent years, the team have shown that a significant amount of cesium rich microparticles (CsMPs) were released from the damaged FDNPP reactors. These particles have a radius of only a few micrometers, and they are mainly composed of Si-glass, Fe, Zn. The radioactive Cs content of the CsMPs is much higher than any other form of Cs-labeled fallout released from the damaged FDNPP reactor units 1-3.The team has previously shown that the particles were likely produced temporarily during the FDNPP meltdown events, when molten fuel in each reactor unit escaped primary containment and impacted the underlying concrete base. To date, work on CsMP containing samples has mainly concentrated on CsMPs found outdoors. The CsMPs were entrained in air and carried into the environment from the damaged reactors, becoming widely distributed in the FDNPP exclusion zone.Recent work by several scientific teams has also shown that CsMP contaminated air masses that passed over the Tokyo region during March 2011. This information, coupled with findings that CsMPs are poorly soluble, has led to questions over potential health risks posed by internal radiation exposure if CsMPs are inhaled. Utsunomiya states that \"given the small size of the particles (generally In the team's most recent work, they show that CsMPs can penetrate buildings in significant amounts, providing a potential indoor risk and highlighting the need for through cleaning of buildings in the exclusion zone if they are to be eventually returned to public use.Dust samples from floors Utsunomiya detailed that the team were given permission to access a school building 2.8 km away from the nuclear power plant that had been abandoned in 2011.\"Fortunately, we got permission to investigate inside an elementary school. When entering the school building, we were all shocked by what we saw. Five years had passed by the time of sampling in 2016, but everything was left as it was at the moment of the 2011 earthquake. It's as if time had stood still,\" says Utsunomiya.The team collected dust samples from floors near to the school's entrance, on its second floor, and in the near-by school yard. Using an autoradiography method previously invented by the team, students Kazuki Fueda and Tatsuki Komiya were able to count the number of CsMPs in the school samples and assign how much of each samples Cs radioactivity came from the microparticles.The Cs radioactivity of the dust on the school's floors ranged from 340\u20144040 Bq/m2 (134+137Cs activity decay-corrected to March 15, 2011. This corresponds to 125\u20141490 Bq/m2 in 2023), with 4.5\u201438.9% of that radioactivity coming from the CsMPs.The highest amount of CsMPs were found near to the school's entrance (up to 2481 particles per m2), while significant (but lower) amounts of CsMPs were found on the second floor (up to 1273 particles per m2). This shows penetration of the tiny fallout particles deep into the building. Interestingly, the CsMP numbers and the proportion of Cs radioactivity attributed to CsMPs in nearby outdoor samples were much lower (23\u201363 particles/g of dust or soil and 1.14\u20131.61% or total Cs radioactivity, respectively).The team state that the indoor environment recorded Cs fallout from dry deposition, and as the school had remained undisturbed since the accident, the CsMPs remained there in significant numbers. The outdoor samples meanwhile record Cs fallout from dry and wet deposition.There, it's likely that some CsMPs may have been washed or blown away by rain and wind, thus Cs remaining in the outside location is dominated by that derived from wet deposition. Those Cs species fell in easily dissolved (soluble) forms, which have now largely become associated with dust and soil particles (e.g., clays).In the study, the team completed a 'wet test' on the indoor samples to evaluate whether common soluble Cs species, such as CsOH or CsI, were present in the samples. After wetting samples with water, no water-soluble Cs species were found in the indoor dusts.Utsunomiya states that \"the properties of the school CsMPs resemble ones reported in many previous studies; they are even similar to the ones found in Tokyo. These CsMPs were distributed across a wide area, including the Fukushima prefecture and Kanto (Tokyo) region. The CsMPs may present a threat; as shown in our work, CsMPs may accumulate locally and form hot spots, even in indoor environments.\"Professor Gareth Law of the University of Helsinki, a co-investigator on the study, added that \"the potential occurrence of CsMPs in indoor environments dictates a need for detailed studies of indoor CsMPs in residential areas impacted by FDNPP fallout.\" He continues that \"further research on the behavior of CsMPs if inhaled, and study of health impacts, were needed.\"Useful information to help repair the damage in UkraineLaw and Utsunomiya added that \"considering the fact that microparticles seem to be a universal radioactive contaminant in severe nuclear accidents, detailed knowledge of their properties, new approaches to estimate their amounts, and studies of their behavior and impacts in environmental and biological systems will be critical if we are to understand the true impact of the nuclear disasters.\"Recent activities in Ukraine near nuclear installations, make the need for such research more pressing.Professor Bernd Grambow, a co-investigator from the University of Nantes added, \"Any decontamination strategy needs to acknowledge that in close vicinity to the power plant, large differences in contamination levels may be encountered and that both ionic and particle bound Cs needs to be analyzed and removed, with the latter being particularly dangerous to cleaning workers.\"Professor Rodney C. Ewing of Stanford University further added, \"This study is latest of an extended series of papers that deal with the composition, characteristics, formation, and number of CsMPs. The groundbreaking aspect of these works is the combined application of multiple advanced techniques e.g., the team's autoradiography methods, high-resolution electron microscopy, and isotopic analysis. The atomic-scale resolution of these studies provides a model for future studies of environmental contamination.\"Utsunomiya finally spoke about the team's sampling trip and the history of their work on CsMPs. \"I believe it is our duty to conduct rigorous scientific research on the tragic Fukushima events, to find and publicize new knowledge that will be important to society and the next generation.\"\"Maybe one day time can begin again for abandoned buildings like the school, but for that to happen, significant clean-up efforts are needed, and if that is to proceed, we first need to know about the forms and extent of contamination in those buildings, such that workers and potential occupants can be protected.\" More information:Kazuki Fueda et al, Occurrence of radioactive cesium-rich micro-particles (CsMPs) in a school building located 2.8 km south-west of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, Chemosphere (2023).

  "text": "An international team of climate scientists has used climate models to show that some very short-lived substances are partially to blame for ozone depletion over the tropics. In their paper published in the journal Nature Climate Change, the group describes how they used a variety of climate models to simulate the impact of very short-lived substances (VSLS) on the lower parts of the ozone layer over the tropics and what they learned by doing so. Seok-Woo Son with Seoul National University, has published a News & Views piece in the same journal issue outlining the work done by the team on this new effort.          In the 1980s, it became clear that substances used by humans were harming the ozone layer, which is a layer of the Earth's stratosphere with a high concentration of ozone that is very important for life on Earth because it absorbs UV radiation. Worried about the damage, world leaders established the Montreal protocol in 1987. It called for the discontinuation of chlorofluorocarbons and some other aerosols. The protocol worked as hoped, and the ozone layer began to recover.But more recently, it has been found that there is still a problem over the tropics, and depletion there is still occurring. Some have suggested it is due to swift upward warm air flow, resulting in winds blowing from the tropics toward the poles, which leaves the stratosphere over the tropics with a thinner ozone layer. In this new effort, the researchers suggest that such an explanation is only partially right. They believe that there are some other gases that are also part of the problem.Suspecting that halogenated VSLS might be playing a role in ozone depletion over the tropics, the research team ran a host of simulations using what they describe as a variety of sophisticated climate models to show what happens when VSLS enter the atmosphere. They found that these substances live long enough to make their way to the lower parts of the stratosphere where they cause damage to the lower parts of the ozone layer. The VSLS were able to do this, the research team noted, because of the strong upward winds over the tropics.Their simulations showed that VSLS are likely responsible for up to 25% of the damage done to the lower part of the ozone layer over the tropics over the past two decades. They conclude their study by suggesting that VSLS be added to the list of banned substances.

  "answer_race": " Microorganisms play a key role in soil carbon storage",
  "question_squad": " What is the most significant factor in soil carbon storage?",
  "answer_squad": " microbial carbon use efficiency",
  "text": "According to a study recently published in Nature, microorganisms play a key role in soil carbon storage. The study, conducted by an international team of scientists including researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, reveals that microbial carbon use efficiency is at least four times more influential than other biological or environmental factors when it comes to global soil carbon storage and distribution. The study's result has implications for improving soil health and mitigating climate change.          Soils serve as crucial carbon sinks in the battle against climate change, storing more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem and three times more than the atmosphere. However, the processes involved in soil carbon storage have not been well understood. While microorganisms have long been recognized as important contributors to the accumulation and loss of soil organic carbon (SOC), the specific contributions of different biological and environmental processes have remained largely unknown.The study, titled \"Microbial Carbon Use Efficiency Promotes Global Soil Carbon Storage,\" and published on May 24 in Nature, employed a novel approach to quantifying the processes that determine soil carbon dynamics. The international research team comprehensively explored the relationship between carbon use efficiency, SOC preservation, and various factors such as climate, vegetation, and soil properties. The study represents the first successful integration of global-scale datasets, a microbial-process explicit model, data assimilation, deep learning, and meta-analysis to examine this relationship.Microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) measures the proportion of carbon used by microbes for growth versus metabolism. When carbon is used for microbial growth, it becomes incorporated into microbial cells, which supports its storage in the soil. Conversely, when carbon is used for metabolism, it is released into the air as carbon dioxide, acting as a greenhouse gas. The study emphasizes that microbial growth is more crucial than metabolism in determining the amount of carbon stored in the soil.\"We found that microbial carbon use efficiency is the most significant factor in soil carbon storage,\" says Feng Tao, the study's first author and recent visiting Ph.D. student at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, Jena, under the guidance of Prof. Markus Reichstein's department.While soil carbon dynamics have been studied since many years, previous research focused primarily on individual processes, such as the input of carbon from leaf litter and roots or the release of carbon dioxide into the air during organic matter decomposition. \"The study shows the importance of microbial traits for carbon cycles and applies a novel strategy, which we proposed a few years ago, for their estimation,\" explains Markus Reichstein, co-author of the study and Director at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry.These new insights highlight the need for further studies on methods to enhance soil carbon sequestration by microbes, the influence of different types of microbes and substrates on soil carbon storage, and on farm management practices. Understanding the microbial processes underlying carbon use efficiency and their dependence on environmental factors can aid in predicting SOC feedbacks in response to a changing climate.

  "text": "Nonagenarian Kanchha Sherpa is the last surviving member of the 1953 expedition that saw Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa become the first humans to summit the world's highest mountain.          But his journey to prominence began in the opposite direction: at 19, he ran away from his home in Namche Bazaar\u2014now the biggest tourist hub on the route to the Everest base camp\u2014to Darjeeling in India, looking for Tenzing in hopes of finding work.The future co-summiteer had already established himself in the hilly Indian region, which was the starting point for expeditions at the time as Nepal had only recently opened to foreigners.At first, the teenager did chores at his mentor's house.Months later he found himself back in his home region as a member of the British expedition, for just a few Nepali rupees (now a few US cents) a day.The team first gathered in Kathmandu, then walked for days to the base camp, carrying tents, food and other equipment.While today's climbers follow a well-trodden route set by experienced Nepali guides, Sherpa remembers the team navigating the pristine mountain on their own.In oversized clothes brought by the British, the Nepalis would sing songs as they ferried supplies to ever-higher camps.

Although he had no mountaineering training, Sherpa climbed beyond 8,000 meters on Everest.Now 90, he was tired and not available to speak to AFP ahead of Monday's anniversary, but his grandson quoted him as saying: \"The happiest part was when Tenzing and Hillary summited.\"'Opened our eyes'Seven decades later, hundreds follow the pioneering duo's footsteps to the summit of Everest every year, fuelling a multi-million dollar mountaineering industry.Thousands more arrive in Nepal to get a glimpse of the breathtaking Himalayas.Over the decades, the term \"Sherpa\" became synonymous with high-altitude guiding as they became the backbone of mountaineering, bearing huge risks to carry equipment and food, fix ropes and repair ladders.Sherpa worked in the mountains for two decades more, until his wife asked him to stop his dangerous journeys.But in a 2019 interview with local channel YOHO TV he said, \"Tenzing and Hillary opened our eyes and made development possible here. Life was very hard before. There were no means to earn a living.\"                Seven decades later, hundreds follow the pioneering duo's footsteps to the summit of Everest every year, fuelling a multi-million dollar mountaineering industry.             He has witnessed the transformation of the Everest region first-hand.\"After the Everest summit, tourism grew here exponentially. Due to that our lifestyle has changed and so has our income,\" he said at the weekend, as quoted by his grandson Tenzing Chogyal Sherpa.The most important change has been the education of Sherpa children, the former climber said.\"They now have the option to study and as a result of that they can be whatever they want\u2014like a doctor or an engineer or even a scientist like my grandson,\" he said.\"I would never have imagined such a thing being possible during my days. That is a benefit of the growing tourism and mountaineering.\"He now leads a foundation in his name, to support families who cannot afford to send their children to school.But he added: \"I fear that the Sherpa youths are getting too influenced by Western culture and might slowly forget the Sherpa culture and language.\"    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Kanchha Sherpa: The last of the first on Everest (2023, May 29)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-kanchha-sherpa-everest.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Where once the population of Barcelona drank mostly from its rivers and wells, Spain's second city now relies upon a labyrinth-like mesh of green, blue and purple pipes inside an industrial plant to keep it from going thirsty amid a prolonged drought.          Water is pumped from two kilometers (1.2 miles) into the Mediterranean Sea to where the Llobregat desalination plant sits on an isolated stretch of beach. After journeying through several cleaning and filtering systems it reaches its final stop: the twisting and turning multi-colored channels that squeeze every drop of water free of its salt.Barely used after being built in 2009, Europe's largest desalination plant for drinking water is running at full throttle to help the greater Barcelona area and some five million people adapt to the impact of climate change, which has contributed to the drying up of southern Europe's fresh water reserves through heat waves and drought.In April 2021, before the drought, rivers provided 63% of Barcelona's drinking water, wells provided 34% and desalination just 3%. Two years later desalination makes up 33% of Barcelona's drinking water, while wells provide 23% and its shrinking rivers just 19%, according to Barcelona's municipal water company.With the reservoirs fed by Catalonia's northern river basins at just 25% capacity, limits have been placed on the amount of water available for agriculture, industry and some municipal uses. But authorities have not had to take drastic action like during the 2006-2008 drought when tanker vessels shipped in drinking water.

That is clear.\"While the building of the Llobregat plant is the result of authorities heeding warnings from climate experts and planning ahead, it comes at high economic and environmental costs.In the desalination process at the Llobregat plant, for every 0.45 liters of fresh water, around 0.55 liters of extremely salty brine is produced as waste. The reverse osmosis process, where high pressure forces seawater through membranes which separates the salt, also requires a lot of energy that doesn't yet come entirely from renewable energy sources.      The Mediterranean region is heating up at a faster rate than many other areas of the globe, leading to a record-hot 2022 in Spain and a widespread drought that is hurting agriculture. The lack of water is particularly acute in northeast Catalonia, whose water agency forecasts that its water resources will shrink by 18% before 2050.

Credit: AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti             Water authorities predict that the Barcelona area is heading for an official \"drought emergency\", which will imply tighter restrictions, by September.\"We forecast that for the rest of May rainfall will be above average, but that does not make up for 32 months of drought,\" Samuel Reyes, head of the Catalan Water Agency, said recently.Desalination has formed a key part of Spain's water policy for over half a century. The island of Lanzarote in Spain's Canary Islands archipelago installed Europe's first desalination plant back in 1964, and the industry has kept growing in the southern European country prone to long, dry summers. The development and spread of the reverse osmosis technique in the 1980s and 90s, along with reduced costs, led to its buildout across many areas of mainland Spain.Spain is now fourth in the world for its desalination capacity, about 5% of the global total, behind Saudi Arabia, the United States and the United Arab Emirates, according to the Spanish Association of Desalination and Water Re-utilization. Desalination capacity has steadily gone up worldwide in the past decade, with the technology seeing a bigger uptick in Europe and Africa.

But since a prolonged drought gripped Spain, the plant has been running at full throttle. Credit: AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti             Spain has some 800 desalination plants that can produce 5 million cubic liters a day of water for drinking, agriculture, and industry. If that were dedicated solely for human consumption, it would quench the thirst of 34 million people\u2014over 70% of Spain's population.As part of a 2.2-billion euro ($2.4-billion) drought response package, Spain's national government said this week that it was setting aside 220 million euros ($238 million) to expand another desalination plant north of Barcelona, plus another 200 million euros ($216 million) for a plant on Spain's southern coast. It also pledged to spend 224 million euros ($242 million) on improving water purification systems in southern Spain.This small miracle of scientific innovation, however, includes even more costs.According to the public company that runs the Llobregat plant, a thousand liters of desalinated water costs 0.70 euros to produce, compared to 0.20 euros for the same quantity of water pulled from the Llobregat river and purified for drinking. That means a heavier tax burden and, possibly, higher water bills.

Credit: AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti, File             Xavier S\u00e1nchez-Vila, professor of civil engineering and groundwater expert for the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, said that while desalination plants like the one in Barcelona have provided a lifeline in a time of crisis, authorities should continue to diversify their strategies and focus on improving water purification and reuse.\"Of course, with climate change we know that droughts are going to be more frequent and therefore there is this need (for desalination),\" he said. \"But in economic terms, I am not completely sure whether it makes sense to keep building them. A few more maybe, but knowing that these are a really expensive solution.\"Instead, S\u00e1nchez-Vila applauds the boost in Barcelona's use of treated sewage water in a separate treatment plant sitting next to the Llobregat desalination facility. This treated water that is reintroduced upstream and then available to be pulled back into the city's supply now accounts for 25% of Barcelona's water.The more pressing problem for the planet is the energy-intensive processes involved in desalination.

Credit: AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti, File                 Spain generated 42% of its electricity from renewable energy sources in 2022 and it hopes to reach 50% this year, but it still uses large amounts of planet-warming natural gas. The electricity generated by the solar panels on the Llobregat plant goes into the electrical grid, not directly to the site's operations.Julio Barea, water expert for Greenpeace in Spain, insists that desalination is not a panacea.Barea cited the steady increase of water use in Spain over past decades to support two of the country's economic pillars: agriculture and tourism. Some 80% of Spain's water goes to agriculture, Greenpeace calculates, while coastal areas including Barcelona are huge tourist magnets, many offering hotels with swimming pools that need filling. Soon-to-be implemented water restrictions in Catalonia will prohibit the filling of private pools, while hotels will still be able to fill theirs.And then there is the impact of dumping the brine waste product into the sea, where its super salty load can hurt the ecosystem.\"(Authorities) have to provide drinking water for people, but desalination plants have an impact because they are essentially water factories that need a lot of energy,\" Barea said. \"It should be a last resource, and we should ask ourselves how we have gotten into this situation.\"    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

New research estimates the city's landmass is sinking at an average rate of 1 to 2 millimeters per year, something referred to as \"subsidence.\"That natural process happens everywhere as ground is compressed, but the study published this month in the journal Earth's Future sought to estimate how the massive weight of the city itself is hurrying things along.More than 1 million buildings are spread across the city's five boroughs. The research team calculated that all those structures add up to about 1.7 trillion tons (1.5 trillion metric tons) of concrete, metal and glass\u2014about the mass of 4,700 Empire State buildings\u2014pressing down on the Earth.The rate of compression varies throughout the city. Midtown Manhattan's skyscrapers are largely built on rock, which compresses very little, while some parts of Brooklyn, Queens and downtown Manhattan are on looser soil and sinking faster, the study revealed.While the process is slow, lead researcher Tom Parsons of the U.S. Geological Survey said parts of the city will eventually be under water.

At some point, those two levels will meet,\" said Parsons, whose job is to forecast hazardous events from earthquakes and tsunamis to incremental shifts of the ground below us.But no need to invest in life preservers just yet, Parsons assured.The study merely notes buildings themselves are contributing, albeit incrementally, to the shifting landscape, he said. Parsons and his team of researchers reached their conclusions using satellite imaging, data modeling and a lot of mathematical assumptions.It will take hundreds of years\u2014precisely when is unclear\u2014before New York becomes America's version of Venice, which is famously sinking into the Adriatic Sea.But parts of the city are more at risk.\"There's a lot of weight there, a lot of people there,\" Parsons said, referring specifically to Manhattan. \"The average elevation in the southern part of the island is only 1 or 2 meters (3.2 or 6.5 feet) above sea level\u2014it is very close to the waterline, and so it is a deep concern.\"                People walk on the Brooklyn Bridge at sunset, Nov. 18, 2022, in New York. metropolis is slowly sinking under the weight of its skyscrapers, homes, asphalt and humanity itself.

It doesn't mean that the buildings are themselves the sole cause of this. There are a lot of factors,\" Parsons said. \"The purpose was to point this out in advance before it becomes a bigger problem.\"Already, New York City is at risk of flooding because of massive storms that can cause the ocean to swell inland or inundate neighborhoods with torrential rain.The resulting flooding could have destructive and deadly consequences, as demonstrated by Superstorm Sandy a decade ago and the still-potent remnants of Hurricane Ida two years ago.\"From a scientific perspective, this is an important study,\" said Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at Columbia University's Climate School, who was not involved in the research.

  "text": "Climate change-driven shifts in the circulation of waters to the deepest reaches of the ocean around Antarctica, which could reverberate across the planet and intensify global warming, are happening decades \"ahead of schedule\", according to new research.          Scientists have said that an acceleration of melting Antarctic ice and rising temperatures, driven by the emission of planet-warming gases, is expected to have a significant effect on the global network of ocean currents that carry nutrients, oxygen and carbon.This could not only threaten marine life, but it also risks changing the ocean's crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide and heat.An earlier study using computer models suggested \"overturning circulation\" of waters in the deepest reaches of the oceans would slow by 40 percent by 2050 if emissions remain high.But new research released on Thursday\u2014based on observational data\u2014found that this process had already slowed 30 percent between the 1990s and 2010s.\"Our data show the impacts of climate change are running ahead of schedule,\" said lead author Kathryn Gunn, of the Australian Science agency CSIRO and Britain's Southampton University.The implications could be significant, with Antarctica's deep ocean acting as a key \"pump\" for the global network of ocean currents.\"As the ocean circulation slows, more carbon dioxide and heat are left in the atmosphere, a feedback that accelerates global warming,\" Gunn told AFP.\"In some ways, the fact that this is happening isn't surprising. But the timing is.\"Gunn said previously it had been difficult to understand the changes happening in the remote region because of a lack of data and a host of challenges for scientific research, from getting funding to facing extreme conditions at sea.The authors used observational data gathered by hundreds of scientists over decades and then \"filled in the gaps\" with computer modelling.Carbon storageOceans are a crucial regulator of the climate, absorbing large amounts of the additional planet-warming carbon that humans have pumped into the atmosphere since the mid-1800s, as well as more than 90 percent of the increased heat.Sea surface temperatures have risen significantly\u2014hitting new records earlier this year\u2014while warming is also melting ice sheets in polar regions, spilling huge quantities of freshwater into the ocean.This is disrupting a key life support function for marine life.The new research, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, found that the oxygen reaching the deep ocean has decreased.\"Deep-ocean animals are adapted to low oxygen conditions but still have to breathe,\" said Gunn.\"These losses of oxygen may cause them to seek refuge in other regions or adapt their behaviour. Deoxygenation of this kind affects biodiversity and food webs.\"Beyond the impact on animals, changes in these key ocean pumps are also expected to reduce the amount of carbon the ocean can absorb, as well as pulling up to the surface carbon that has been safely stored away in the ocean depths for hundreds of thousands of years.Ariaan Purich, from the School of Earth, Atmosphere and Environment at Australia's Monash University, said the study was significant because \"it provides further support\u2014including observational evidence\u2014that the melting Antarctic ice sheet and shelves will impact the global ocean overturning circulation\".Purich, who was not involved in the study, said this would have \"important impacts on the ocean uptake of heat and carbon\".

  "question_squad": " What is the term for the gradual accumulation of sediments?",
  "answer_squad": " Slow soil creep",
  "text": "Sand dunes are not an obvious place to find high-quality fire records. For a start, anyone who walks on the forested sand dunes of South-East Queensland will be impressed by the intensity of ant activity at their feet. The ant nests extend at least 2 meters below the surface. As the ants move materials around their nests, any charcoal from past fires that's preserved in the sand would be severely disturbed.          Somewhat surprisingly, though, soil pits dug at the bottom of the slope of dune front walls (the leading edge of a dune) revealed different sediment layers are preserved there. This shows ant activity is not intense on the foot slopes. It's possible for undisturbed charcoal records to be recovered from this part of the dune.Our newly published research focuses on four well-dated sand dunes. Unlike previous studies that extracted fire histories from sediment cores from lakes, bogs and other organic sediments, we extracted fire records from these dunes. We believe this is a breakthrough that will greatly expand the areas for which we can extract fire histories.Swamps and lakes are typically found in more humid areas and near the coast, whereas sand dunes occur widely across drier areas of Australia, including desert regions. This new source of fire histories can help us broaden our understanding of fire in Australia.Why does a new source of fire records matter?Fire is important in the Australian landscape. Many ecosystems are designed not only to survive fire but need burns to survive and thrive.                (a) Orange areas show world dryland distribution (Sorensen, 2007) and white dots show published paleofire records from the Global Paleofire Database (Harrison et al., 2022). (b) View of Australia and the general locations of coastal (yellow) and continental (orange) dunes (Lees, 2006; Hesse, 2016). Much of Australia and the world is both covered in drylands and lacking fire histories. Credit: From Patton et al 2023/Quaternary Research, CC BY In recent years, however, the scale and intensity of bushfires in Australia have increased, culminating in the Black Summer of 2019-20. During that summer, areas that did not normally burn severely were intensely burned. The fires caused long-lasting damage to vegetation and significant loss of both human and animal life and buildings.There are concerns that if the climate patterns associated with the Black Summer fires become more established, Australia's ecology could be permanently altered and human activities severely impacted in many regions.There is an urgent need to better understand the role of fire in the Australian landscape, prompting a surge in research on both modern fire behavior and extracting fire histories from the landscape. These histories are crucial, because they can help us to identify and quantify the risk of fires. These studies can also highlight where climate and ecological changes have created new fire risk.      Scientists have until now relied on cores from lakes, bogs and other sources of organic sediments to extract fire histories. The gradual accumulation of these sediments preserves charcoal from past fires in layers. The layers can be dated, revealing the age of the charcoal and hence when the fire occurred. This means we can extract continuous records of past fire regimes from these sediments.However, because of the focus on organic-rich sediments, these fire histories have been limited to humid areas, where swamps and lakes are present. Sediments like these are mostly close to the coast. Fire hazard is much more widely spread in Australia. So what did the dune study find?                Charcoal deposited on the dune surface by past fires collects in sediment layers at the base of the dune. Credit: Patton et al 2023/Quaternary Research, CC BY Our study focuses on the fire history of the Cooloola Sand Mass between Noosa and Tin Can Bay in South-East Queensland. We examined four well-dated sand dunes ranging from 500 to 10,000 years old.In a 2022 study, we showed there are two distinct phases in the sediment records. These match a historic change in slope processes on the dunes.For the first 1,000 years after the dunes stabilized, frequent but minor flows of sand grains down the front face of the dune slowly built up sediments at the foot of the dune. The sand deposited at the base includes the remnants of charcoal from local fires that deposited on the dune's surface. This sediment builds up over time, preserving layers of charcoal from fires.The distinct layers of charcoal in the sand represent individual fire events. These charcoal layers can be reliably identified using radiocarbon dating.After about 1,000 years, the dune slopes became less steep. Slow soil creep, which is the gradual grain-by-grain movement of sand through the ground under gravity, became the dominant process. Charcoal is dispersed through the sediments. This means individual fires cannot be recognized but overall fire activity is still well recorded.We compared the fire records from the sand dunes to local and regional fire histories. The records from the dunes matched the other records. Our records show a relationship between fire and stronger El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) periods\u2014associated with more frequent drought conditions\u2014in South-East Queensland.There are very few fire histories from dryland regions worldwide. And, like Australia, extreme fires are increasing in these regions, which include California and Mediterranean Europe. We should now be able to better define natural fire hazard in these arid zones.

  "text": "Seventy years ago, New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Nepali Tenzing Norgay Sherpa became the first humans to summit Everest on May 29, 1953.          The British expedition made the two men household names around the world and changed mountaineering forever.Hundreds now climb the 8,849-meter (29,032-foot) peak every year, fuelling concerns of overcrowding and pollution on the mountain.AFP looks at the evolution of the Everest phenomenon.What is the mountain called?Initially known only to British mapmakers as Peak XV, the mountain was identified as the world's highest point in the 1850s and renamed in 1865 after Sir George Everest, a former Surveyor General of India.On the border of Nepal and China and climbable from both sides, it is called Chomolungma or Qomolangma in Sherpa and Tibetan\u2014\"goddess mother of the world\"\u2014and Sagarmatha in Nepali, meaning \"peak of the sky\".How has climbing Everest changed?The 1953 expedition was the ninth attempt on the summit and it took 20 years for the first 600 people to climb it. Now that number can be expected in a single season, with climbers catered to by experienced guides and commercial expedition companies.The months-long journey to the base camp was cut to eight days with the construction of a small mountain airstrip in 1964 in the town of Lukla, the gateway to the Everest region.Gear is lighter, oxygen supplies are more readily available, and tracking devices make expeditions safer. Climbers today can summon a helicopter in case of emergency.Every season, experienced Nepali guides set the route all the way to the summit for paying clients to follow.But Billi Bierling of Himalayan Database, an archive of mountaineering expeditions, said some things remain similar: \"They didn't go to the mountains much different than we do now. The Sherpas carried everything. The expedition style itself hasn't changed.\"What is base camp like?The starting point for climbs proper, Everest Base Camp was once little more than a collection of tents at 5,364 meters (17,598 feet), where climbers lived off canned foods.Now fresh salads, baked goods and trendy coffee are available, with crackly conversations over bulky satellite phones replaced by wifi and Instagram posts.                The daily number of climbers who reached the summit of Mount Everest since the first successful climb in 1953.             How does the news of a summit travel?Hillary and Tenzing summited Everest on May 29 but it only appeared in newspapers on June 2, the day of Queen Elizabeth's coronation: the news had to be brought down the mountain on foot to a telegraph station in the town of Namche Bazaar, to be relayed to the British Embassy in Kathmandu.In 2011, British climber Kenton Cool tweeted from the summit with a 3G signal after his ninth successful ascent. More usually, walkie-talkie radios are standard expedition equipment and summiteers contact their base camp teams, who swiftly post on social media.In 2020, China announced 5G connectivity at the Everest summit.      What are the effects of climate change? Warming temperatures are slowly widening crevasses on the mountain and bringing running water to previously snowy slopes.A 2018 study of Everest's Khumbu glacier indicated it was vulnerable to even minor atmospheric warming, with the temperature of shallow ice already close to melting point.\"The future of the Khumbu icefall is bleak,\" its principal investigator, glaciologist Duncan Quincey, told AFP. \"The striking difference is the meltwater on the surface of the glaciers.\"Three Nepali guides were killed on the formation this year when a chunk of falling glacial ice swept them into a deep crevasse.It has become a popular cause for climbers to highlight, and expedition companies are starting to implement eco-friendly practices at their camps, such as solar power.What is the impact of social media?Click, post, repeat\u2014the climbing season plays out on social media as excited mountaineers document their journey to Everest on Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms.Hashtags keep their sponsors happy and the posts can catch the eyes of potential funders.That applies to both foreign climbers and their now tech-savvy Nepali guides.\"Everyone posts nowadays, it is part of how we share and build our profile,\" said Lakpa Dendi Sherpa, who has summited Everest multiple times and has 62,000 Instagram followers.Mountain of records?Veteran Nepali guides Kami Rita Sherpa and Pasang Dawa Sherpa both scaled Everest twice this season, with the latter twice matching the former's record number of summits before Kami Rita reclaimed pole position with 28.There are multiple Everest record categories for first and fastest feats of endurance.But some precedents are more quixotic: in 2018, a team of British climbers, an Australian and a Nepali dressed in tuxedos and gowns for the world's highest dinner party at 7,056 meters on the mountain's Chinese side.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Then and now: 70 years of Everest (2023, May 28)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-years-everest.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Coastal ecosystems can absorb or emit the three main greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.          We explored how coasts in ten regions of the world differ in greenhouse gas uptake and emissions. Our research published today in Nature Climate Change finds that, globally, our coastal ecosystems are a net greenhouse gas sink, but smaller emissions of potent methane and nitrous oxide gases reduce some of the carbon dioxide uptake.We found coasts in Europe and Russia are net emitters, while coasts in Southeast Asia and North America have a large uptake of these gases.Like upland forests and rainforests, ecosystems like coastal wetlands can take up atmospheric CO\u2082 and turn it into new leaves, roots and other organic matter. When some of this carbon is stored long-term in deep sediments, it can help battle rising CO\u2082 levels in our atmosphere.The coastal net greenhouse gas uptake should not be confused with carbon storage. Only part of the coastal greenhouse gas uptake is stored long-term in coastal sediments, while another part is transported to the ocean where it might be stored or released back to the atmosphere.Not all coasts are the sameAfrica and Australia have large swathes of sandy coastline and coastal wetlands. By contrast, Europe and Russia's cold coastline lacks mangroves or tropical coastal wetlands. These differences drive the changes we found in how different coasts take up or emit greenhouse gases.The strongest coastal greenhouse gas sink is Southeast Asia, because of its extensive and productive tropical mangrove forests and seagrasses which soak up large amounts of CO\u2082. North America's coast is another excellent sink for greenhouse gases, with its salt marshes, mangroves, seagrasses\u2014and Canada's fjords, glacier-made valleys filled with seawater.While Australia and New Zealand have long stretches of coastal wetlands soaking up CO\u2082, this is offset by a large number of estuaries, many of which are a source of greenhouse gases produced by decaying organic matter.Coasts in Europe and Russia actually release more greenhouse gases than they absorb. Their many polluted tidal estuaries release greenhouse gases, but the colder climate means this region has fewer coastal wetlands to soak these gases back up.But across the three main greenhouse gases, eight out of the ten world coastal regions are a net greenhouse gas sink.                This figure shows the net fluxes of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide in estuaries (yellow arrows), coastal vegetation (peach arrows) and combined (red arrows) in 10 regions around the world. Southeast Asia (9), North America (1) and Africa (4) are strong coastal greenhouse gas sinks. South America (2), Australasia (10), and West Asia (6) are moderate sinks, while East Asia (7) and South Asia (8) are weak sinks. Europe (3) and Russia (5) are weak coastal sources of greenhouse gases. Credit: Rosentreter et al. (2023) Nature Climate Change, CC BY Some coasts soak up greenhouse gases while others emit moreThe world's coastal ecosystems are enormously diverse, ranging from tropical lagoons to polar fjords to coastal mangrove forests to underwater seagrass meadows. This sheer variety means they differ greatly in how they take up or release greenhouse gases.For example, we show that fjords around the world take up around 40% of CO\u2082 that would otherwise be released from tidal systems, deltas and lagoons. Most (86%) of this important CO\u2082 uptake by fjords comes from the North America region.By contrast, salt marshes and mangroves are home to trillions of microorganisms which live in deep, oxygen-free sediments, eating dead organic matter and emitting methane and nitrous oxide. Some of these gases reach the atmosphere, making many coastal waters a source of methane and nitrous oxide.Coastal wetlands release more than three times more methane than all estuaries in the world. But coastal wetlands, also called coastal \"blue carbon\" wetlands, can be strong sinks of CO\u2082 and some also take up nitrous oxide. On balance, these coastal ecosystems become a net greenhouse sink when we consider the net effect of these three most important greenhouse gases.What does the big picture look like? Globally, our research shows our coasts' ability to take up CO\u2082 is offset between 9% and 20% by coastal methane and nitrous oxide emissions.Why is this knowledge important?If we understand how our coastal ecosystems take up or emit greenhouse gases, we can target the most crucial ecosystems for preservation or restoration.That's why many researchers are interested in blue carbon as a way to boost long-term carbon storage. By protecting and restoring mangroves and salt marshes in nations rich in blue carbon, such as Indonesia, we can expand their ability to take these gases back out of the atmosphere and ultimately store some of the carbon long-term in their sediments.And by reducing nutrient overload, organic matter and wastewater flows into our coastal waterways, we can cut the greenhouse gases emitted by polluted estuaries.We shouldn't just see our coastal ecosystems as a boon to carbon credit markets. They have much more to offer, including many valuable ecosystem services. Our coasts protect our shorelines from severe weather and tides. They are a nursery for many fish and plants. And they're vital to us as a place to be in nature.Protecting our coasts is good for us, for nature and for the earth system as it plunges into the climate crisis. More information:Judith A.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the plastic that is woven into clothing?",
  "answer_squad": " polylactic acid",
  "text": "Plastic pollution has emerged as one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time. Over 100 million tons of plastic enters the environment each year, with more than 10 million tons ending up in our oceans. These plastics break down into harmful microplastic particles so small they can be consumed by wildlife.          We all recognize discarded bottles and bags as plastic waste. But the synthetic fibers that are woven into our clothing\u2014polyester, nylon, acrylic and others\u2014are equally problematic. Every year, more than 60 million tons of plastic fabric is produced, a considerable amount of which ultimately finds it way to landfill.One promising approach to tackle this crisis is the use of \"biodegradable\" plastics. These plastics are designed to break down naturally into gases and water, which are then released back into the environment without causing long-lasting damage.But the reality of biodegradable plastic (or \"bioplastic\") falls short of meeting our expectations. New research, led by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California, has found that a popular bioplastic material called polylactic acid does not break down in the environment nearly as quickly as hoped.The researchers suspended fiber samples from both bio- and oil-based plastic materials, as well as natural fibers such as cotton, in coastal waters and on the seafloor. Over time, they examined these individual fibers under a microscope to see if they were breaking down. While cotton fibers began to break down within a month, synthetic fibers, including bioplastic materials such as polylactic acid, showed no signs of breaking down even after 400 days submerged in the ocean.Finding their way into the seaThe plastic pollution that stems from clothing is a particularly tricky area. Clothes are often not recycled or even recyclable, and they release tiny plastic fibers into the environment through gradual wear and tear.                Disintegration time in days for five types of material exposed to coastal waters. Credit: Royer et al. (2023), CC BY-NC-ND Clothing fibers can reach our oceans via multiple pathways. Clothes that are washed into the sea, for example, will be broken up physically by wave action or friction with sand particles. This process leads to the release of fibers as the garment frays.Even by just wearing our clothes, plastic fibers are discharged into the environment\u2014some of which may eventually settle in the ocean. And during the process of washing our clothes, fibers become dislodged and are carried down our drains, also potentially ending up the sea.No matter what we do, clothing fibers will inevitably find their way into the environment. So, it is sensible to give serious consideration to what happens to these fibers once released.      Why does this matter?Research has found evidence that polylactic acid microfibres are potentially toxic to marine organisms, including jellyfish. The jellyfish studied changed their pulse frequency when exposed to high concentrations of these plastic fibers, potentially reducing their ability to hunt, avoid predators, and maintain orientation in the water.The presence of polylactic acid fibers in the marine environment may cause jellyfish numbers and behavior to change. Such changes could have far-reaching implications for marine ecosystems. Jellyfish are widely distributed across all oceans and play a crucial role in the marine food web, both as predators and prey.The longevity of polylactic acid fibers in the marine environment is another concern. The longer these fibers remain in the environment, the more likely it is they will be eaten by marine organisms.                A compass jellyfish drifting off the Welsh coast. Credit: JDScuba/Shutterstock Bioaccumulation, where microplastics and their associated chemicals accumulate across a marine food web, is then likely to occur. Research has found evidence of microplastic bioaccumulation across multiple species and microplastic types.Tackling plastic pollutionNo matter how the plastic enters the environment, solutions are needed to tackle plastic pollution. Biodegradable plastics are one potential option, but only if they are made from materials that are truly able to break down quickly in the natural environment. They would reduce the time in which plastic materials spend in the environment.As with conventional plastics, though, bioplastics must still be disposed of correctly. But research has found that the labels and instructions on many biodegradable products are often confusing and misleading. In a study of 9,701 UK citizens, many reported not having understood the meaning of the labels of degradable, compostable and biodegradable plastics.This could lead to biodegradable and non-biodegradable plastics being disposed of incorrectly. Plastic that is released into the environment may not decompose, and will instead break down into small pieces of microplastic.Polylactic acid can break down in specialized industrial composting plants. But even then, not all composting processes can handle every type of bioplastic. The plastic material has to meet specific criteria and produce compost of a minimum standard.As the world uses more biodegradable plastic, we need to make sure this material's environmental footprint is minimized. With that in mind, improving labeling and disposal instructions and improving access to industrial composting could all help.

  "answer_squad": " overturning circulation",
  "text": "Antarctica sets the stage for the world's greatest waterfall. The action takes place beneath the surface of the ocean. Here, trillions of tons of cold, dense, oxygen-rich water cascade off the continental shelf and sink to great depths. This Antarctic \"bottom water\" then spreads north along the sea floor in deep ocean currents, before slowly rising, thousands of kilometers away.          In this way, Antarctica drives a global network of ocean currents called the \"overturning circulation\" that redistributes heat, carbon and nutrients around the globe. The overturning is crucial to keeping Earth's climate stable. It's also the main way oxygen reaches the deep ocean.But there are signs this circulation is slowing down and it's happening decades earlier than predicted. This slowdown has the potential to disrupt the connection between the Antarctic coasts and the deep ocean, with profound consequences for Earth's climate, sea level and marine life.Our new research, published today in the journal Nature Climate Change, uses real-world observations to decipher how and why the deep ocean around Antarctica has changed over the past three decades. Our measurements show the overturning circulation has slowed by almost a third (30%) and deep ocean oxygen levels are declining. This is happening even earlier than climate models predicted.We found melting of Antarctic ice is disrupting the formation of Antarctic bottom water. The meltwater makes Antarctic surface waters fresher, less dense, and therefore less likely to sink. This puts the brakes on the overturning circulation.Now that\u2019s a waterfall: dense water flowing from the continental shelf into the deep ocean in the Ross Sea. Consortium for Ocean-Sea Ice Modelling in Australia (COSIMA) and National Computational Infrastructure.Why does this matter?As the flow of bottom water slows, the supply of oxygen to the deep ocean declines. The shrinking oxygen-rich bottom water layer is then replaced by warmer waters that are lower in oxygen, further reducing oxygen levels.Ocean animals, large and small, respond to even small changes in oxygen. Deep-ocean animals are adapted to low oxygen conditions but still have to breathe. Losses of oxygen may cause them to seek refuge in other regions or adapt their behavior. Models suggest we are locked in to a contraction of the \"viable\" environment available to these animals with an expected decline of up to 25%.Slowdown of the overturning may also intensify global warming. The overturning circulation carries carbon dioxide and heat to the deep ocean, where it is stored and hidden from the atmosphere. As the ocean storage capacity is reduced, more carbon dioxide and heat are left in the atmosphere. This feedback accelerates global warming.Reductions in the amount of Antarctic bottom water reaching the ocean floor also increases sea levels because the warmer water that replaces it takes up more space (thermal expansion).      Signs of a worrying changeMaking observations of bottom water is challenging. The Southern Ocean is remote and home to the strongest winds and biggest waves on the planet. Access is also restricted by sea ice during winter, when bottom water forms.                Freshening of shelf waters reduces the flow of dense water and slows the deepest parts of the overturning circulation while also reducing deep oxygenation. Credit: Kathy Gunn, Author provided             This means observations of the deep Southern Ocean are sparse. Nevertheless, repeated full-depth measurements taken from ship voyages have provided glimpses into the changes underway in the deep ocean. The bottom water layer is getting warmer, less dense and thinner.Satellite data shows the Antarctic ice sheet is shrinking. Ocean measurements taken downstream of regions of rapid melt show the meltwater is reducing the salinity (and density) of coastal waters.These signs point to a worrying change, but there are still no direct observations of the deep overturning circulation.What did we do?We combined different types of observations in a new way, taking advantage of each of their strengths.The full-depth measurements collected by ships provide snapshots of ocean density, but are usually repeated about once a decade. Moored instruments, on the other hand, provide continuous measurements of density and speed, but only for a limited time at a particular location.Antarctic ice mass loss over the last few decades based on satellite data, showing that between 2002 and 2020, Antarctica shed an average of ~150 billion metric tonnes of ice per year, adding meltwater to the ocean and raising sea-levels. Credit: NASAWe developed a new approach that combines ship data, mooring records, and a high resolution numerical simulation to calculate the strength of Antarctic bottom water flow and how much oxygen it transports to the deep ocean.Our study focused on a deep basin south of Australia that receives bottom water from several sources. These sources lie downstream of large meltwater inputs, so this region is likely to provide an early warning of climate-induced deep ocean changes.The findings are striking. Over three decades, between 1992 and 2017, the overturning circulation of this region slowed by almost a third (30%) causing less oxygen to reach the deep. This slowing was caused by freshening close to Antarctica.We found this freshening reduces the density and volume of Antarctic bottom water formed, as well as the speed at which it flows.The observed slowdown would have been even greater if not for a short-lived climate event that drove a partial and temporary recovery of bottom water formation. The recovery, driven by increased salinity, further illustrates the sensitivity of bottom water formation to salinity changes on the Antarctic continental shelf.Worryingly, these observations show that changes predicted to occur by 2050 are already underway.Abyssal ocean warming driven by Antarctic overturning slowdown. Credit: Matthew England and Qian LiWhat next?Ice loss from Antarctica is expected to continue, even accelerate, as the world warms. We are almost certain to cross the 1.5\u2103 global warming threshold by 2027.More ice loss will mean more freshening, so we can anticipate the slowdown in circulation and deep oxygen losses will continue.The consequences of a slowdown will not be limited to Antarctica. The overturning circulation extends throughout the global ocean and influences the pace of climate change and sea level rise. It will also be disruptive and damaging for marine life.Our research provides yet another reason to work harder\u2014and faster\u2014to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

  "text": "The tragic war underway in Sudan will soon start to impact neighboring countries, as refugees cross borders to flee the violence. Recurring civil conflicts have already displaced up to 3.2 million Sudanese internally. The latest violence\u2014focused on Khartoum but flaring all around the country\u2014is pushing more people to flee.          Already 20,000 Sudanese have crossed from Darfur into Chad, where some 400,000 refugees have been living in 13 camps for many years. Some 10,000 have headed north to Egypt in late April. Refugees are also ending up in South Sudan and Ethiopia, where recent heavy rainfall and resulting floods have affected hundreds of thousands of people. Floods have destroyed homes, livestock, and agricultural land, which could drive further rural-to-urban migration within the region.In these receiving countries, the arrival of thousands of refugees may overwhelm already fragile infrastructure and public health services for some of the world's most vulnerable populations. What's more, Sudan itself hosts one of the largest refugee populations in Africa, many of whom are considering \"going home\". For example, some 70,000 refugees from Ethiopia fled to Sudan during the recent Tigrayan War. If they do, return movements will add to the influx of refugees moving into neighboring countries.To support refugees and returnees, attention is needed in the urban areas where they almost always end up: informal settlements.Take the city of Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia. It's estimated that more than 80% of the city's population live in informal settlements: areas that often lack clean water or waste management, where housing is made from found materials, roads are unpaved, and electricity is sporadic at best.Informal settlements in Addis\u2014like many cities around the world\u2014are some of the most densely populated places on Earth, yet events like the Sudanese war and the displacement it's caused will contribute to their already rapid expansion.Already one of the biggest cities in Africa (its population is over 5 million), Addis is growing quickly, especially its informal settlements. But urban management of informal settlements is extraordinarily challenging\u2014even locating them is a major hurdle for local government planners, who brought this issue to our attention in our briefings with them.      Our research has attempted to map informal settlements in inland African cities, including Addis, using satellite data and Google Street View imagery. Our maps have tried to project climate impacts like flooding across cities.Our climate modeling has found that informal settlements are at high risk for flooding today, and at an even greater risk in 25 and 50 years' time, given projected increases in future seasonal rainfall. With flooding comes great risk to human life and property, threatening to wash away precariously built homes and the lives within them. This past March, four family members were tragically killed as a flood washed away their home in Nifas-Silk Lafto, an area of Addis Ababa that our analysis identified as having a high flood risk.Without better alternatives, Sudanese refugees arriving in informal settlements in neighboring countries put themselves in a different kind of danger: environmental risk. Their arrival will further tax the fragile infrastructure of informal settlements and exacerbate existing flooding hazards. Sudan's crisis can thus further inflame environmental risk in urban informal settlements across the region.The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) provides temporary shelter to Sudanese refugees, but many will ultimately forgo formal humanitarian assistance and head for the informal settlements in neighboring cities, where many have families and ethnic networks. But without direct support, these cities face potentially calamitous outcomes.The U.S. can lead by sending expert teams to these informal settlements in Addis, Cairo, and N'Djamena in Chad to support them in accommodating new arrivals. Additionally, local and international researchers can collaborate with these growing cities to support them through research and technical assistance.Tailored, data-rich maps identifying the intersecting urban and climate risks are vital to understanding where the greatest threats to the cities' most vulnerable populations, and where to build infrastructure like sewers, clean water systems, and drainage to help manage and sustain the new influx of people fleeing conflict. It is a small but critical step to mitigating widespread suffering across the region in times of crisis.

  "answer_squad": " Green infrastructure",
  "text": "A case study by SMU Assistant Professor Sayd Randle reveals how the maintenance of green infrastructure can place an extra burden on lower-income marginalized communities.          \"I see moving to Singapore as an exciting opportunity to extend my research program beyond the United States and develop new work on the urban environmental challenges facing Asian cities,\" says Sayd Randle, who recently joined Singapore Management University (SMU) as an Assistant Professor of Urban Studies in the College of Integrative Studies.Professor Randle's research focus is on the spatial and cultural politics of urban climate adaptation. She recently published a case study based on field work she conducted on a green infrastructure pilot project in a residential area of Los Angeles (LA).Green infrastructure, in an urban water-management context, is defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as infrastructure that \"uses vegetation, soils, and other elements and practices to restore some of the natural processes required to manage water and create healthier urban environments\".Since the 1970s, the benefits to humans from cultivating and employing environmental assets have been known as ecosystem services.The idea became more prominent among policymakers and practitioners during the 1990s\u2014spurred on by the attention of mainstream economists, excited at the possibilities of putting a price on the systems of nature.\"Critics have correctly identified the ecosystem services paradigm as a market-driven approach to nature, one grounded in the idea that properly valuing a resource necessarily leads to its efficient use or management,\" Professor Randle says.\"But I'm perhaps more interested in the messiness that attempting to approach ecosystems as a set of priceable functions entails in practice, particularly in contexts where sustained human labor is necessary to deliver the desired services.\"\"Watching efforts to conscript new forms of 'work' from an ecosystem from an ethnographic perspective quickly reveals such accounting processes to be partial, contested, piecemeal and deeply political\u2014as I explore through my Los Angeles case study,\" she says.Managing yards as green infrastructureProfessor Randle's study centers on a residential retrofit project in which a local non-governmental organization (NGO) installed green infrastructure, free of charge, on the properties of 24 households in a working-class, majority Latinx neighborhood on the north-eastern edge of the city.Like many lower-income sections of LA, this area is dominated by modest single-family homes sitting within small, tidy yards.Participants signed paperwork committing to maintain the installations on their property for three years. The project was explicitly premised on public agencies playing no role in upkeep.\"Largely glossed as stewardship, residents who have long lived with insufficient flood infrastructure and disproportionate pollution are now being asked to take on the volunteer work of keeping these installations functional,\" Professor Randle says.It is an extra burden on households already working long hours and struggling to fit in family time. Maintenance entails regular clearing, de-silting, weeding, and pruning of the infrastructure, which includes a mix of parkway swales, rain gardens, rain tanks and permeable driveways.The offer of free upgraded yards was not so free in terms of time and exertion, and Professor Randle finds these new forms of work spatially reinscribe the city's classed and racialised patterns of socio-environmental inequality.\"By considering both the benefits and the unremunerated labor that these infrastructures bring to certain sections of the city, my research illuminates some of the complicated dynamics that can undermine these well-intentioned green initiatives,\" she says.      Environmental duties\"LA stands out as a city that is seeking to develop green infrastructure to not only improve water quality in local streams, but also to recharge aquifers that sit beneath the city and provide residents with part of their drinking water supply,\" Professor Randle says.\"Driven by this dual mission, the city's green infrastructure efforts are concentrated in sections of the city that overlay a critical groundwater basin.\"Such is the site of Professor Randle's field work.\"While the influx of green infrastructure projects unquestionably brings new ecosystem services to residents of these neighborhoods in the form of reduced storm flows and increased greenery, the city's approach to siting, funding and maintaining the installations means that they also bring new forms of unpaid labor to residents,\" she says.It raises the issue of how such non-valued labor should be considered within frameworks of environmental justice.\"Bringing labor more squarely into the frame of environmental justice analysis is a move grounded in the recognition that ecologies are constantly made (and unmade), partially through human effort,\" Professor Randle says.\"Approaching landscapes as produced rather than as given helps to open up conversations about what forms of landscape work are being asked of which people, how that labor is valued, and how it relates to notions of collective benefit.\"\"Complementing the notion of ecosystem services, I label the human work of helping to produce those functions as ecosystem duties, a term I hope will spark further consideration of when and how such labor is passed along to marginalized communities,\" she says.Public resourcesProfessor Randle notes the importance of acknowledging unpaid ecosystem duties in green infrastructure planning.\"Making explicit the non-valued labor that green infrastructure planning documents often assume will be taken on by local residents can provide an opening for community groups to contest such arrangements and also help to clarify why installations sometimes fail to function as planned,\" she says.So, how could the sharing of environmental duties be made more equitable?\"My short answer: dedicate public resources to making more of these duties into some form of paid work, with an eye to creating opportunities for marginalized communities.\"\"[And] in areas like the neighborhood where I conducted my field work, where green infrastructure provides aquifer recharge functions, the city's water agency could offer a substantive reduction to monthly water bills to reflect residents' ongoing work and contribution to the city's water supply.\"The picture is different in LA's more affluent residential areas. They are not targeted for green infrastructure to the same degree because they do not sit on permeable ground above the key groundwater basin, and so cannot provide the same aquifer recharge functions.\"Setting that point aside, a key difference is that wealthy communities and residents can more easily pay for landscape maintenance work. So in those settings, ecosystem duties are more likely to be seen as labor to be done by hired workers, rather than the necessary stewardship of the residents\u2014a very different dynamic, to say the least,\" Professor Randle says.

  "text": "Climate leaves indelible marks on our lives\u2014impacting where we live, what we eat, our work and our leisure. Two scientists recently documented one of climate's lesser-known impacts: our given names.          Co-authors Raymond Huey, a professor emeritus of biology at the University of Washington, and Donald Miles, professor of biological sciences at Ohio University, reported that the popularity of certain month and season names for girls varies by geographic region in the continental United States.The name April dominates monthly names in southern states where spring arrives early in the year. June is more popular in northern states where spring blooms later. Autumn is also more prevalent in the northern U.S., a region known for its brilliant fall foliage.The trends, published in Evolutionary Human Sciences, surprised even the researchers.\"I thought that climate and the environment might influence the choice of baby names, but I never thought we would see a clear trend for either month or seasonal names, simply because parents take into consideration many factors when they name their child,\" said Huey. \"Because of these other factors\u2014including strong cultural trends and traditions\u2014I expected that there'd be too much social 'noise' in the data and we'd have a low chance of seeing any environmental 'signal.' But the signals were there, and they were strong.\"Miles added: \"My initial reaction was we may not find any trend in the baby names. Parents have many reasons for selecting a name for their child, e.g., honoring a relative, actor or even whimsy. I was surprised to the significant environmental influence on names associated with seasons and months.\"The authors analyzed data on baby names from 1910 to 2021 collected by the U.S. Social Security Administration. Other researchers have used this database to document boom and bust cycles for names across decades. But this study is among the first to look for a role of climate.The data showed that month-based names\u2014the most popular being April, May, June and August\u2014were more than 9 times more prevalent for baby girls than baby boys. Seasonal names were 182 times more numerous in girls than boys, with Summer and Autumn the most popular overall. August was the only prevalent month or season name that was more common in boys.      Huey and Miles broke apart the prevalence of the five popular season and month names for girls by state, which is how they started to uncover clear geographic trends.April's relative frequency decreased with the latitude of each state, making it most common in in the south, while Autumn increased strongly with latitude and was most common in northern states. In states along the southern border of the continental U.S., April was much more common than June, and the opposite was true for states along the northern border. And Autumn was by far the most common season name in northern-border states, but not in states along the southern border.The strong geographic trends for April, June and Autumn likely reflect climate. April is more popular in places like Texas and Florida, where spring weather arrives relatively early in the year. June is more popular in northern states, like Maine and Wisconsin. And the prevalence of the name Autumn in the northern U.S. correlates with the picture-perfect fall colors in this region.\"What makes these geographic trends so striking to me is that we could still see them for April, June and Autumn even though these names have gone through major 'boom' and 'bust' cycles over the decades,\" said Huey.June was very popular in the early 20th century, but April ascended after World War II, peaking in the 1980s. Seasonal names were \"virtually unknown\" until the late 1970s, said Huey.Climate change is shifting seasonal patterns, with spring \"arriving\" earlier and autumn \"arriving\" later. Miles and Huey checked to see if month and season names were also shifting\u2014whether April, for example, had recently become more popular in northern states. They did not find a shift, and reason that such a \"signal\"\u2014if it exists\u2014may be difficult to see because some month names have been decreasing overall in popularity in recent decades.\"It's also possible that we need more time to learn whether climate change is affecting the popularity of some of these names,\" said Huey.An ecologist, Huey's prior research looked at the effect of temperature and other environmental factors on animals ranging from lizards to marine life. Studying baby names, though a divergence for him and Miles, who is also an ecologist, has shown a novel way that human culture is impacted by the surrounding climate.Huey and Miles are also curious if climate will have other effects on baby names. In addition to months and seasons, plant names\u2014such as Rose, Lily and Willow\u2014are popular. It's possible those names also vary by geography and climate, and could shift as the planet warms.\"We won't know unless someone looks,\" said Huey. \"And, for the U.S. at least, there is a great dataset for that.\" More information:Raymond B.

  "text": "As an important indicator of climate change in cold regions, changes in lake area are important for understanding hydrological and ecological processes in cold regions.          The interplay between lakes and permafrost is complex. Previous studies have shown significant zonal differences in the variation of lake area in permafrost regions. However, the seasonal variation of lakes in permafrost regions and the conditions under which they occur are unclear.Based on high-quality remotely sensed global water body products, a research team led by Prof. Ran Youhua from the Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources of the Chinese Academy of Sciences investigated lake area changes from 1987 to 2017 in seven carefully selected watershed permafrost areas of the Arctic and Tibetan Plateau with a 30-m resolution, to explore different effects of surface water balance on lake area change under different permafrost, terrain and climate conditions.This study was published in Science of The Total Environment.The study showed that the maximum (seasonal and permanent) surface area of lakes in the permafrost regions of the seven basins net increased by 13.45% from 1987 to 2017. Among them, the seasonal lake area net increased by 28.66%, while the permanent lake area net increased by 6.39%. A total of 2.99% of the maximum surface area of lakes disappeared, including 2.48% of the seasonal surface area and 3.22% of the permanent surface area.Additionally, inter-basin comparison showed that the annual lake surface area decreased in the Arctic basin, but increased in the Tibetan Plateau.On the lake region scale, the contained lakes were classified according to the characteristics of annual area change, including no change, homogeneous changes (only expansion or only shrinkage), heterogeneous changes (expanded lakes neighboring shrunken lakes, EL-SL) and abrupt changes (newborn or vanished lake). It was found that lakes with heterogeneous changes accounted for more than a quarter of all lakes.By comparing the environmental conditions between different classifications, the researchers found that lakes with variable lake area, especially heterogeneous changes and abrupt changes, are distributed in the regions with low and flat terrain, high-density water bodies and high permafrost surface temperature.\"The change of surface water balance cannot completely explain the change of lake area in the permafrost area,\" said Prof. Ran. \"We further revealed the potential critical point effect of permafrost degradation on lake change from the perspective of data.\" More information:Yang Su et al, Remotely sensed lake area changes in permafrost regions of the Arctic and the Tibetan Plateau between 1987 and 2017, Science of The Total Environment (2023).

  "text": "A study has found widespread mass loss of glaciers and ice caps in Greenland since the start of the 20th century.          The research provides critical insights into long-term changes to the glaciers and ice caps as a result of climate change, which has contributed about one fifth to global sea-level rise in the last decade.Using historical data, scientists mapped 5,327 glaciers and ice caps that existed at the end of the Little Ice Age in 1900, a period of wide-spread cooling when average global temperatures dropped by as much as 2\u00b0C. They were then able to reveal that these fragmented into 5,467 glaciers and ice caps by 2001.The study\u2014Mass Loss of Glaciers and Ice Caps Across Greenland Since the Little Ice Age\u2014published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, said Greenland's glaciers have lost at least 587 km3 of ice over the last century, accounting for 1.38 millimeters of sea-level rise.It estimated that the speed at which the water melted between 2000 and 2019 was three times higher that the long-term\u2014since 1900\u2014average.Lead author, Dr. Jonathan L. Carrivick from the School of Geography at the University of Leeds, said, \"The impact of meltwater run off from Greenland into the North Atlantic extends beyond global sea-level rise, affecting North Atlantic ocean circulation, European climate patterns, and Greenlandic fjord water quality and marine ecosystems.\"\"This has immense implications on humans too, with these glacier changes having a direct impact on the economic activities of fishing, mining, and hydropower, as well as affecting people's health and behavior.\"Greenland's glaciers and ice caps rank as the second-largest source of meltwater, after Alaska.Co-author, Dr. Clare Boston from the School of the Environment, Geography, and Geosciences at the University of Portsmouth, said, \"Previous research using satellite data suggests Greenland's glaciers and ice caps could lose between 19 percent and 28 percent of their volume by 2100.\"\"These predictions only use information gathered from the past few decades, whereas our research provides baseline data from more than 100 years ago. Seeing how glaciers have evolved over a longer period of time, can give us a better chance of predicting how they'll change in the future.\"\"It's also important to note, that we only looked at glaciers and ice caps that were at least 1 km2 in area, so the overall amount of ice that has melted would be even more than our predictions if you take into account the smaller ones.\"The paper stresses the importance of understanding these changes in the context of global sea-level rise.The research also emphasizes the complex nature of glacier evolution due to considerable differences in locations, temperatures, and the influence of regional and local factors.Glaciers in the North have experienced the greatest speed up in rate of mass loss compared to other regions. Glaciers terminating in lakes have increased the most in their rate of mass loss.Dr. Carrivick added, \"This study contributes great spatial coverage, spatial resolution and temporal detail to our understanding of Greenland's glacier changes, providing a valuable resource for policymakers, scientists, and stakeholders concerned with climate change and its impacts.\"\"It represents a crucial step towards unraveling the dynamics of Greenland's glaciers and their role in global climate change, as the world faces the challenges posed by a warming Arctic.\" More information:Jonathan L.

  "text": "Urban areas are where the majority of the world's population lives, and they are also usually most affected by climate change. Heat waves and extreme temperatures are more intense in heavily-built areas, intensifying existing weaknesses and inequalities among the urban population.          An interdisciplinary study published in Urban Climate  and led by the CMCC Foundation focuses on the Urban Heat Island phenomenon, providing a reproducible and flexible methodology to explore the risk assessment on the heat-health nexus within the city of Turin, Italy.The Urban Heat Island (UHI) is defined as a temperature difference between urban and rural areas, caused by the excess of heat emitted and by the solar gain trapped by the urbanized environment.\"The UHI phenomenon is typical of urban areas and it is stronger during heat waves events,\" said Marta Ellena, of the CMCC's REgional Models and geo-Hydrological Impacts (REMHI) division, and first author of the paper. \"This happens because cities are mostly covered by impermeable surfaces, and this makes temperatures higher, worsening the already existing UHI effect.\"The main objective of the study was to produce climate risk assessment evaluations at the local scale taking under consideration the main drivers of inequality, which are crucial for suggesting adaptation strategies for more climate-resilient and sustainable cities.An important feature of the study was the identification of the UHI risk per census tract, which is the minimum geographical entity of data collection currently available from Italian municipalities. \"This is one of the most innovative aspects of this work,\" said Ellena, \"because previous studies considered city's quarters or districts. For example, Turin has 23 quarters and 8 districts: in this study we considered its census tracts, which are 3843, so it is an enormous set of information, especially compared to previous studies.\"The research was carried out adopting an up-to-date theoretical framework proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and applying it on the urban area of Turin, the fourth most populated Italian urban area.      The UHI-related risk is described in this framework as a combination and interaction of three main factors: hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.The climate hazard is represented by the UHIs and their distribution within the city boundaries; exposure refers to the presence of vulnerable citizens in urban areas who are likely to be adversely affected by the occurrence of UHI phenomena: in this case, the population aged 65 or over.Finally, vulnerability is defined as made up of two factors, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Sensitivity is composed of the elements which contribute to the susceptibility of the exposed population considered, such as demographic and socioeconomic factors, health conditions and the environmental context of the urbanized area. Adaptive capacity, on the other hand, takes into consideration the availability of facilities and services which contribute to more favorable conditions for individuals under extreme temperatures.\"The combination of all these different factors allows us to express the complexity of the concept of risk associated with Urban Heat Islands,\" said Guglielmo Ricciardi, of CMCC and Politecnico di Torino, another author of the study. \"It's not only greener or more urbanized areas that influence the risk on citizens. We should also consider the characteristics of buildings, the proximity to hospitals, or to public spaces with air conditioning, among others.\"The results were collected in tables and visualized through georeferenced maps for individual and aggregated indicators, and are open access and available under a creative commons license.The results of the study allowed for the identification of UHIs in the city of Turin, and the associated risk for the population, as well as the priority areas for intervention on a highly detailed scale. While the lowest hazard was measured in green areas corresponding with the main urban parks, thus demonstrating the significant contribution of vegetation to heat reduction, higher-risk zones are mostly located in the densely populated areas of the suburbs.\"A strength of this work is that such a high-resolution analysis of the connection between the UHI hazard, the population exposure, and the related vulnerabilities at the urban level is still uncommon,\" said Ellena, \"and we hope it will be used by policymakers for informed decisions and adaptation measures, or by other researchers as a guidance to reproduce similar analyses in other Italian (and not Italian) urban contexts.\" More information:Marta Ellena et al, Micro-scale UHI risk assessment on the heat-health nexus within cities by looking at socio-economic factors and built environment characteristics: The Turin case study (Italy), Urban Climate (2023).

The annual precipitation was the lowest recorded since 2012.The number of hot days and extreme high temperature events were both the highest in history, while the national average number of rainy days was the lowest. The precipitation in summer and autumn was less than normal. The average precipitation in summer was the second lowest since 1961. In summer, Northeast and North China had more rainfall during the flood season, while the Yangtze River Basin had less, resulting in extreme heatwaves and severe droughts.In 2022, there was an apparent stepwise feature of drought regionally, with southern China heavily affected by long droughts in summer and autumn. Rainstorm processes occurred frequently, especially over the Pearl River Basin and the Songliao River Basin, causing severe flooding disasters in South China and Northeast China.In summer, the strongest heatwave since 1961 occurred in central and eastern China. Persistent cold, rainy, snowy, and sunless weather was observed in southern China in February, and a strong cold wave from late November to early December caused severe cooling over a large area. Sandstorm weather appeared less frequently and later than normal, and landfalling typhoons were extremely less frequent.

  "answer_squad": " Today, virgin raw polymer is cheaper than recycled polymer",
  "text": "Humanity uses and abuses hundreds of millions of tonnes of plastic a year because \"it's so cheap\", despite the huge cost of the pollution it creates, the head of the UN Environment Programme told AFP.          Inger Andersen, an economist by training, told AFP she that a binding, \"ambitious\" global treaty would help fix the problem, ahead of the second round of UN-led negotiations that diplomats from 175 nations aim to conclude next year.The interview has been edited for concision and clarity.Q: What are the main obstacles to an ambitious treaty?A: Today, virgin raw polymer is cheaper than recycled polymer. So here's the question: What will allow us move from that linear 'we take it, we make it, we waste it' reality to a circular approach? Right now, it's so inexpensive you can just throw plastic away. But the cost to the environment and human health is huge, and it is not taxed anywhere.Q: Less than 10% of plastic is recycled today\u2014is that a credible solution?A: We can't recycle our way out of this mess. But recycling is one of the many keys that we will need to make this work. Today, we simply throw plastic away because it has no value.When I was a little girl growing up in Denmark with very limited pocket money, my brothers and I collected plastic bottles every Saturday because we could get two krone. It wasn't much, but it made it worthwhile. Now imagine the day that this stuff has value\u2014we would think about and treat that garbage very differently!                A dhow made from recycled plastic off the northern coast of Kenya.             Q: What changes in attitude or mentality do you think we need to see?A: Awareness is step one. Which is not to say the burden falls entirely on consumers\u2014at the end of the day, it's business and governments that have to take that responsibility.But every consumer has a choice. Let's say we have a party. Do we need single-use cups and plastic bags? If that bag I use to carry home five tomatoes is a heavy polymer, it will sit in a landfill for hundreds of years, maybe a thousand. Why are supermarket bananas in a plastic bag? Nature already delivered them with their own packaging.So there are choices we can make. Children get it, and are already holding their parents to account. But the bigger system shifts will come from agreements such as the one we are negotiating.      Message to business: 'lean into it'Q: Plastic pollution has not been a priority on the international agenda until quite recently. What changed?A: The popular demand for solutions has become powerful, and it's coming across the board from left to right in most countries. I put it down to activism across a broad spectrum, and I am very, very grateful. I ask all those activists to keep the heat on to ensure that the treaty had ambitious and binding elements.                Plastic waste.             Q: Many green groups are worried that the plastics industry will have an undue influence in the talks.A: For this second round of negotiations we have 2,800 participants\u2014908 from government and 1,712 from non-government organisations (NGOs). There are ten industry associations represented. They have a role to play.Take ozone, which is probably our most successful treaty. We couldn't find a solution to the manufactured gases depleting the ozone layer without having industry at the table.Here's what I say to business: this is coming to a movie theatre near you soon. You might as well lean into it and be part of the change, because we will get a treaty and it will be ambitious. Once we make the enabling legislation, business will follow.Q: Can the world do without plastics at all?A: Plastic is everywhere. We're still going to need light switches, steering wheels, metro seats, whatever. But we need to think about the single-use dimension.We are abusing plastic because it's so cheap. But this has consequences in the environment, in the oceans, to our health.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:'We abuse plastic, it's so cheap': UN Environment chief (2023, May 26)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-abuse-plastic-cheap-environment-chief.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "A U.S. Supreme Court ruling this week rolled back protections for many wetlands nationwide. North Carolina is considering a law that would require the state to use the same test for a \"wetland\" as the federal government, which advocates warn would leave vast swaths of fragile areas like this one in Aurora, NC, without protection. 2006 News & Observer file photo          A proposed state law could mean that the Supreme Court's decision this week to roll back Clean Water Act protections for many wetlands has significant impact for North Carolina, according to environmental advocates.In Sackett v. EPA, the Supreme Court ruled that in order to be considered a \"water of the United States,\" and thus to receive protection, a wetland needs to be indistinguishable from a larger body of water. That means many seasonal wetlands would no longer be protected, even if they neighbor larger waterways.A provision in the N.C. Farm Act currently being considered by the General Assembly would remove protections from wetlands using the standards set forth in the Sackett case. That proposed law would require North Carolina's wetlands protections to match the federal governments, and not go any further.Environmental advocates warned that provision along with the Supreme Court's ruling could imperil fragile wetlands in North Carolina, opening them up to development and increasing flood risks for low-lying communities throughout the state.\"The only thing now protecting many North Carolina communities from being flooded in the coming years is the state's existing ban on paving over wetlands without a permit. The N.C. General Assembly should not remove that protection\u2014it is literally protecting lives and property,\" Grady McCallie, the N.C. Conservation Network's policy director, wrote in a statement.Each session, the General Assembly passes a Farm Act, a collection of laws and provisions meant to aid the state's agricultural sector. This year's version, Senate Bill 582, requires the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality to redefine wetlands in a manner consistent with federal laws.Those laws were fundamentally altered and limited by the Supreme Court's decision in Sackett v. EPA.But Kelly Moser, a Southern Environmental Law Center senior attorney, said that means wetlands like Carolina bays and pocosins would no longer be protected.How redistricting in NC can tip the balance of power here and in Congress.      \"It requires the state definition of wetlands to match the federal definition, which would obviously harm North Carolina's ability to preserve the flood resilience benefits of our wetlands for downstream communities,\" Moser said.The Farm Act has passed the Senate and is set for a vote next week by the House Agriculture Committee. It must pass through two more committees before a full vote by the House, at which point the Senate would need to approve any changes before the bill could be sent to Gov. Roy Cooper.A Southern Environmental Law Center analysis found that a Trump administration definition of \"waters of the United States\" would lift protections on 526,996 acres of wetlands in the Cape Fear River basin and 364,586 acres in the Neuse River basin.The Sackett decision is likely, Moser said, to lead to a stricter definition than that proposed by the Trump administration.The case was filed by a couple who purchased property in Idaho and started filling it with dirt to prepare the site for construction of a home. The EPA informed them that the property was defined as \"waters of the United States\" because it featured a ditch that led to a creek that led to a nearby lake.Both the U.S. District Court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found in favor of the EPA using a long-established test that a wetland is protected if it has a \"significant nexus\" to a nearby waterway. The Supreme Court reversed their decision.\"For our floodplain wetlands that are not right next to a large waterway or a protected stream, those wetlands are not indistinguishable from a larger water body and they would be left without any protections,\" Moser said.Some celebrated Thursday's decision, saying it brings clarity to a long-standing legal question and rolls back often-confusing regulations that resulted in overreach.U.S. Rep. David Rouzer, a Wilmington Republican, praised the ruling in a statement and said it shows the Biden administration should have waited to release new Waters of the United States rules.\"The Supreme Court rightly recognizes that the significant nexus test, which underpinned the Biden rule, is an improper reading of the Clean Water Act. The only reasonable step for the Administration to take now is to withdraw its ill-advised rule,\" said Rouzer, who chairs the U.S. House of Representatives' Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee.    2023 The News & Observer.Distributed at Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "answer_squad": " Mont Blanc",
  "text": "Mountains\u2014their height, their mass, their climates and ecosystems\u2014have fascinated humans for thousands of years. But there is one that holds extra-special meaning for many\u2014Mount Everest, or Chomolungma as the Nepalese Sherpa people call it.          A sacred mountain for some, for others the world's highest peak represents a challenge and a lifelong dream. Seventy years ago, on May 29, 1953, that challenge and dream became reality for two members of a British expedition: New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay became the first people to reach the 8,848.86-meter summit.Their achievement was a testament to endurance and determination. It was also the crowning glory of the British expedition's nationalistic motivations on the eve of the young Queen Elizabeth's coronation.From our vantage in the present, it also represents a high point, not just in climbing terms, but in what we now think of as the modern era of mountaineering. Since then, mountaineering has become massively popular and commercial\u2014with serious implications for the cultures and environments that sustain it.Scaling the heightsThe early mountaineering era began in 1786 when Jaques Balmat and Michel Paccard reached the summit of Mont Blanc, the highest peak in the European Alps at 4,808 meters. From 1854 to 1899 (known as the classic mountaineering period), advances in climbing technology saw ascending peaks by challenging routes become possible and popular.During the modern era from 1900 to 1963, mountaineers pushed further into the Andes cordillera in South America, explored polar mountains and began high-altitude climbing in Central Asia.Shishapangma, the last of the world's 8,000-meter peaks to be climbed, was scaled in 1964, marking the start of contemporary mountaineering. Since then, all of the world's 8,000-meter peaks have been climbed in winter, culminating in the historic winter scaling of the 8,611-meter K2 by a Nepalese expedition in 2021.The record-setting assault on the world's 14 highest peaks by Nirmal Puja in 2019 set the stage for a new period of commercial mass mountaineering\u2014involving expectations and conditions that would have stunned the likes of Hillary and Norgay.      Mass mountaineeringThe relatively recent influx of what some call novice mountaineers, who may expect luxury packages and a guarantee of summiting, can have dangerous consequences.Sleeping in heated tents, not preparing their own food or helping to move equipment, does not test mental and physical fitness in such challenging environments. Pushing to the summit may put their own lives, and the lives of other climbers and rescue teams, at risk.And yet the number of people attempting to climb famous peaks such as Kilimanjaro in Tanzania or Aconcagua in Argentina has increased dramatically. In 2019, there were 878 successful summits on Everest alone.The days when true mountaineers were looking for new routes and climbing with minimum support have almost disappeared from commercial peaks like Everest. And many of these commercial climbers would not have a chance without professional support.In 1992, for example, when the first commercial mountaineering expeditions on Everest began, 22 Sherpas and 65 paying mountaineers summited\u2014one Sherpa for three clients. Nowadays, two or even three Sherpas for each member of a commercial expedition is common.But the romance and achievements of past mountaineers, combined with social media images and an \"all-inclusive\" adventure tourism industry, can lull inexperienced climbers into a false sense of security. On Everest, this has led to overcrowding, environmental degradation and increased risks for all climbers.During the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, Nepal's Khumbu region\u2014where Everest sits\u2014was effectively shut for climbing. This year, however, some estimate a record of more than 1,000 people could reach the summit.The next challengeExperienced mountaineers are responding to the challenges of overcrowding, pollution and socio-cultural impacts on mountain communities by advocating for more responsible and sustainable mountaineering practices.They want stricter regulations and better training to protect the fragile ecosystems of the Himalayas and other mountain ranges worldwide.This will require many stakeholders to play their part, including governments, mountaineering organizations, tourism operators and local communities. Ultimately, the future of mountaineering depends on preserving these unique mountain environments in the first place.Finally, maybe it's time to introduce minimum skill requirements for climbing the world's highest peak.As we mark the 70th anniversary of the first ascent of Everest, we need to reflect on the changes that have taken place in mountaineering since. Paradoxically, while it has become more accessible and popular, it has also become more challenging and complex.Meeting those challenges and solving the problems will be the best way to honor the extraordinary achievement of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay.

  "question_race": " What is the main idea of the passage?",
  "answer_race": " The risk of flash droughts is increasing.",
  "question_squad": " What is the term for when the weather is hot and dry?",
  "answer_squad": " flash droughts",
  "text": "Flash droughts develop fast, and when they hit at the wrong time, they can devastate a region's agriculture.          They're also becoming increasingly common as the planet warms.In a new study published May 25, 2023 in Communications Earth & Environment, we found that the risk of flash droughts, which can develop in the span of a few weeks, is on pace to rise in every major agriculture region around the world in the coming decades.In North America and Europe, cropland that had a 32% annual chance of a flash drought a few years ago could have as much as a 53% annual chance of a flash drought by the final decades of this century. The result would put food production, energy and water supplies under increasing pressure. The cost of damage will also rise. A flash drought in the Dakotas and Montana in 2017 caused US$2.6 billion in agricultural damage in the U.S. alone.How flash droughts developAll droughts begin when precipitation stops. What's interesting about flash droughts is how fast they reinforce themselves, with some help from the warming climate.When the weather is hot and dry, soil loses moisture rapidly. Dry air extracts moisture from the land, and rising temperatures can increase this \"evaporative demand.\" The lack of rain during a flash drought can further contribute to the feedback processes.Under these conditions, crops and vegetation begin to die much more quickly than they do during typical long-term droughts.Global warming and flash droughtsIn our new study, we used climate models and data from the past 170 years to gauge the drought risks ahead under three scenarios for how quickly the world takes action to slow global warming.If greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, power plants and other human sources continue at a high rate, we found that cropland in much of North America and Europe would have a 49% and 53% annual chance of flash droughts, respectively, by the final decades of this century. Globally, the largest projected increases would be in Europe and the Amazon.Slowing emissions can reduce the risk significantly, but we found flash droughts would still increase by about 6% worldwide under a low-emissions scenario.      Timing is everything for agricultureWe've lived through a number of flash drought events, and they're not pleasant. People suffer. Farmers lose crops. Ranchers may have to sell off cattle. In 2022, a flash drought slowed barge traffic on the Mississippi River, which carries more than 90% of U.S. agriculture exports.If a flash drought occurs at a critical point in the growing season, it could devastate an entire crop.Corn, for example, is most vulnerable during its flowering phase, called silking. That typically happens in the heat of summer. If a flash drought occurs then, it's likely to have extreme consequences. However, a flash drought closer to harvest can actually help farmers, as they can get their equipment into the fields more easily.In the southern Great Plains, winter wheat is at its highest risk during seeding, in September to October the year before the crop's spring harvest. When we looked at flash droughts in that region during that fall seeding period, we found greatly reduced yields the following year.Looking globally, paddy rice, a staple for more than half the global population, is at risk in northeast China and other parts of Asia. Other crops are at risk in Europe.Ranches can also be hit hard by flash droughts. During the huge flash drought in 2012 in the central U.S., cattle ran out of forage and water became scarcer. If rain doesn't fall during the growing season for natural grasses, cattle don't have food, and ranchers may have little choice but to sell off part of their herds. Again, timing is everything.It's not just agriculture. Energy and water supplies can be at risk, too. Europe's intense summer drought in 2022 started as a flash drought that became a larger event as a heat wave settled in. Water levels fell so low in some rivers that power plants shut down because they couldn't get water for cooling, compounding the region's problems. Events like those are a window into what countries are already facing and could see more of in the future.Not every flash drought will be as severe as what the U.S. and Europe saw in 2012 and 2022, but we're concerned about what may be ahead.Can agriculture adapt?One way to help agriculture adapt to the rising risk is to improve forecasts for rainfall and temperature, which can help farmers as they make crucial decisions, such as whether they'll plant or not.When we talk with farmers and ranchers, they want to know what the weather will look like over the next one to six months. Meteorology is pretty adept at short-term forecasts that look out a couple of weeks, and at longer-term climate forecasts using computer models. But flash droughts evolve in a midrange window of time that is difficult to forecast.We're tackling the challenge of monitoring and improving the lead time and accuracy of forecasts for flash droughts, as are other scientists. For example, the United States Drought Monitor has developed an experimental short-term map that can display developing flash droughts. As scientists learn more about the conditions that cause flash droughts and about their frequency and intensity, forecasts and monitoring tools will improve.Increasing awareness can also help. If short-term forecasts show that an area is not likely to get its usual precipitation, that should immediately set off alarm bells. If forecasters are also seeing the potential for increased temperatures, that heightens the risk for a flash drought's developing.Nothing is getting easier for farmers and ranchers as global temperatures rise. Understanding the risk from flash droughts will help them, and anyone concerned with water resources, manage yet another challenge of the future. More information:Jordan I.

  "answer_squad": " Emerald Tutu",
  "text": "Picture Boston Harbor, a few years from now. The East Boston Greenway, a leafy urban trail, no longer stops a block from the pier, but extends into the ocean. A floating semi-circular trail arcs across the water; cyclists buzz and pedestrians stroll along it.          This is more than a buoyant park. The real innovation surrounds the path. On both sides, marsh grass splays out from hundreds of 6-foot-wide floating spheres, made of deadwood and coconut fiber. The bobbing green-brown globes are man-made, a new wetland riding atop the ocean.This is the Emerald Tutu\u2014a new coastal defense against rising seas, conceived by Julia Hopkins, a Northeastern University civil and environmental engineering professor, and fellow researchers. If it works, it could protect low-lying East Boston from future floods caused by climate change.The Emerald Tutu project places Hopkins and her co-inventors at the avant-garde of a growing trend. All along the U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast, and on other shorelines around the world, nature-based solutions to rising seas, including \"living shorelines,\" have grown in popularity in the past decade.Engineers are designing and building oyster reefs in the Chesapeake Bay, reinforcing barrier islands in Louisiana, restoring wetlands, and (in tropical climes like Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula) planting mangrove trees along shorelines\u2014all to absorb waves and storm surges. They're an attractive idea for large coastal cities and small shore towns alike, as they look for new ways to keep the ocean at bay.If done right, nature-based solutions could also have other environmental benefits, such as purifying the waters. \"If you're going to do a nature-based solution, you might as well do one that improves the natural environment,\" Hopkins says. \"If you don't care about improving your natural environment, you could just put up a wall. That will work. We know how walls work.\"The Emerald Tutu would go a step further than other nature-based coastal projects. It would be a living artificial shoreline, protecting the real one.\"We were trying to think about a flexible, natural solution that could be adaptable to a changing climate,\" says Hopkins. \"It's for shorelines that otherwise don't have many natural defenses.\"East Boston once had a marshy, soft shoreline, but the city built a \"hard\" one, where Logan Airport and Eastie's harbor piers stand now.\"The tutu is a way of restoring a marsh without actually restoring the marsh,\" Hopkins says. The floating mats, she says, would be linked together. \"Both the density of an individual mat and the interplay between mats allows them to dissipate wave of energy as storms pass through,\" she says. \"They're reducing the amount of energy that's reaching the shoreline and, ideally, reaching inhabited areas.\"The new floating marsh could also help make Boston Harbor's waters healthier.\"Floating wetlands tend to purify the surrounding waters,\" says Hopkins. \"If we put them off of the shoreline around Logan, could we maybe absorb some of that runoff from an active airport and help purify the harbor a bit?\"The idea behind nature-based coastal defenses like the Emerald Tutu is to offer a new alternative to sea walls\u2014not a substitute for them, but a complement that's part of a larger coastal defense system. That's important as coastal cities and towns prepare for the rise in sea level and the more extreme storms that climate change is bringing.      Measure that stormDown the hall from Hopkins' office in Northeastern's Snell Engineering Center, her colleague, Qin Jim Chen, also studies nature-based coastal defenses. He's not an inventor\u2014he's a tester.Chen has studied climate change for decades, and he knows the increased dangers it's bringing. In 2004, when he was a professor at a university in Mobile, Alabama, he went to New Orleans to deliver a conference talk about climate change and a tropical storm that had flooded Mobile. But as he prepared to deliver the talk, a new storm developed: Hurricane Ivan was forecast to hit the Gulf Coast. The conference was canceled, and Chen joined the evacuation from New Orleans to Mobile\u2014a drive that took 10 hours, rather than the usual two. Then the forecast changed\u2014Ivan was now aiming for Mobile, not New Orleans\u2014so Chen had to evacuate again, inland to Tuscaloosa.That wasn't Chen's last struggle with a hurricane. A year later, Hurricane Katrina ripped a hole in the roof of his home.                Credit: Julia Hopkins             Those destructive storms have helped motivate Chen. For years, he has worked with a network of scientists along the Gulf Coast, setting up sensors that measure tides, winds and waves during hurricanes. Chen and his collaborators often install the gauges just hours before storms hit.Now, he's also working on defenses against them. Chen is collaborating with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to measure the effectiveness of living shoreline projects along the East Coast.\"We know that wetlands can reduce a storm surge,\" says Chen. But until recently, he says, scientists didn't have the tools to evaluate when that was happening. Now, Chen's modeling and analysis are producing new insights into when a rebuilt wetland or an oyster reef protects the shore behind it.Marsh grasses and oyster reefs alike can dampen wind-whipped waves and storm surges. \"The oyster [reefs], and also salt marshes, they will keep pace with sea-level rise, if they grow, if they're healthy.\" But, Chen says, \"We find that some projects are effective, and some projects are actually not.\" Differences in sediment supplies, water salinity, and water temperature can help determine whether a marsh or an oyster reef grows.Shorelines need to grow within Goldilocks zoneOne insight from Chen's work: To dissipate wave energy, living shorelines need to grow within a Goldilocks zone\u2014not too tall or short, but just right. \"Usually, you have the immediate need to build it tall, to reduce the wave energy, because that's how I want to protect the shore,\" he says\u2014\"but if it's too tall, actually, it's out of the optimal growth zone of oysters. It's not inundated frequently enough.\" The same thing for wetland vegetation: \"It may be too high, or too low, and it's not going to survive.\"Restoration of wetlands and oyster reefs to absorb wave energy have been \"quite successful\" in Louisiana, Chen says. Another success story is an oyster reef project in Chincoteague, adds Chen, who carried out a 2019 field experiment there. In Chen's photos of the project, outcroppings made of oysters pop up from the seafloor, the shells reaching toward the sky like tulips. Behind them stand a reedy, marshy shore and a slightly raised coastal road, both protected by the reef.Now, Chen is developing design guidelines for engineers: how can they best restore a wetland and combine it with traditional coast defenses like levees and dikes? In a paper in the March 2023 issue of the journal Coastal Engineering, Chen and colleagues propose a unified formula for measuring vegetation's drag coefficient: a measure of how much different salt marsh grasses slow wave flow. \"Engineers could use that [formula], regardless of what vegetation you have,\" says Chen. \"Is it very flexible vegetation or very stiff vegetation? As long as you know how stiff they are, then we can actually use this one single formula.\"So far, most living shoreline projects are small-scale, protecting smaller communities in places such as the Chesapeake Bay shore in Maryland and Virginia. Chen is working with the town of Marshfield, Massachusetts, and the Shinnecock Tribal Nation on Long Island, New York, on pre-proposals for designing nature-based solutions for their coasts.In the New Orleans area, wetland projects and restoration of barrier islands are now playing a role in protecting the city, though tall levees still form the Crescent City's main defense. For cities, Chen says, the next step is to use nature-based solutions as part of shoreline defense of low-lying areas\u2014something Boston is already planning to do. He thinks that could include his colleague's Emerald Tutu project, which has impressed him so far.\"It's a great idea,\" Chen says. \"It's certainly innovative, especially for Boston, because we have these big tides here. A floating device can move with the tides.\" He looks forward to Hopkins and her collaborators mounting a pilot demonstration to show it's effective. \"It has great potential.\"Emerald Tutu would protect shorelineIn 2021, Hopkins tested the Emerald Tutu's prototype marsh-grass mats in a wave pool in Oregon. Last year, she and her fellow researchers deployed one tutu mat each in East Boston and in Salem, Massachusetts. This summer, they plan to launch a bigger test: several marsh-mats, in an interlocking network, to see if they dissipate wave energy as designed. \"Do they actually work to prevent flooding, and if so, what is that mechanism?\" Hopkins says. The goal, she says, is \"to design numerical models that can simulate large amounts of these things along many different types of shorelines.\"Hopkins' team developed the Emerald Tutu idea a few years ago in response to a call for ideas to protect East Boston from storm surge. The majority-Hispanic neighborhood is one of the most flood-prone parts of Boston, at risk as world sea levels rise due to climate change.No U.S. city has a full-fledged, funded plan to defend against rising seas, but Boston is farther along than most, says Chen. Its Climate Ready Boston effort includes coastal resilience plans for East Boston and the city's other at-risk neighborhoods: Dorchester, Charlestown, South Boston, the North End, and downtown. Projects on the drawing board include a study about possibly elevating parts of East Boston's Belle Isle Marsh.The Emerald Tutu, which is meant to buffer harder, more industrialized parts of the shore, isn't in Boston's plans yet; Hopkins and her partners are working to build community support for the idea. But they designed it with Boston in mind; the name Emerald Tutu is a nod to the city's Emerald Necklace of parks and parkways designed by Frederick Law Olmsted.\"I do not think the Emerald Tutu will work everywhere,\" says Hopkins. It's mostly designed to work in landscapes similar to the northeastern U.S. \"I think it would work in places like Maine, Boston and New York City\u2014places that have either rocky outcrop coasts, or small beaches, or places where there used to be a marsh and then we just put things on top of the marsh.\" More information:Ling Zhu et al, Towards a unified drag coefficient formula for quantifying wave energy reduction by salt marshes, Coastal Engineering (2022).

  "text": "In the first week of 2023, slow-moving Tropical Cyclone Ellie dropped 800mm of rainfall, flooding the Fitzroy River in Australia's northwest. Local residents were cut off from food and other supplies, leading to their evacuation by two military transport aircraft.          This was one of Western Australia's worst flooding events, and it was fed by a weather pattern that has caused an almost doubling of rainfall in this part of the world over the last 70 years.Alongside changing temperatures, changing patterns of rainfall have always been a matter of intrigue and concern.The northwest region of Australia, with its vast and diverse landscapes, has seen a massive increase in rainfall since the 1950s. This increase has been difficult to explain, but our new research may have finally uncovered the cause.The wet season is getting wetterNorthwest Australia is located within the tropics, which means there are two main seasons in the year\u2014wet and dry. The wet season starts in November and finishes in April, and provides around 90% of the yearly rainfall, while the dry season lasts from May to October.At some point in the wet season, usually around December, the winds change from the east to the northwest, bringing large amounts of moisture and rainfall\u2014the monsoon has started.Rainfall in the monsoon is more intense, more persistent and more widespread. And the amount of rainfall from each monsoon has been increasing since the 1950s, with some areas now receiving an extra 200mm of rain per year.Most other regions in Australia, in stark contrast, have been drying.So we set out to understand why rainfall has increased so much in northwest Australia. We found the cause to be changes we have observed in a pulse of cloudiness and rainfall known as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO).For this analysis, we used a network of rainfall stations that the Bureau of Metrology has been operating for over a century\u2014providing us with long-term rainfall records. Then, to understand the background atmospheric changes that may have led to this cause, we used output from satellites. Our paper is published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.The MJO is a rainfall generatorThe journey of the MJO begins in the Indian Ocean, where it travels eastwards across the north of Australia, moving at around 20km/h. As the MJO passes over northern Australia, the chance of extreme rainfall triples (with extreme rainfall defined as the chance of weekly rainfall being in the top 20%).The MJO continues towards South America, finally decaying when it reaches the cool waters of the Eastern Pacific. Overall, the journey takes between 30 and 90 days.On its journey, the MJO aids in the formation of tropical cyclones by acting as a source of moisture and updrafts. This was the case for the flooding in the Fitzroy River, where the tropical cyclone initially formed while the MJO was over northern Australia.Similarly, the record-breaking North Queensland floods in early February 2019 were also found to be intensified by the MJO. And besides extreme rainfall events, the MJO can also worsen heat waves in southern Australia by sucking moisture away from the region.The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) explained: Credit: Meat and Livestock AustraliaThe Indo-Pacific warm pool is growingThe path of the MJO goes directly over the Indo-Pacific warm pool. This is the largest body of warm waters on the planet, where sea surface temperatures permanently exceed 28\u00b0C. The warm pool is centered around Indonesia and extends eastward and westwards into the Indian and Pacific Oceans.Warming from greenhouse gases, such as CO\u2082 and methane, has caused the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool to double in size. On average, the warm pool has been expanding by the size of Victoria (280,000 square kilometers) each year since the year 1900.The expansion of the warm pool has resulted in the cycle of the MJO becoming \"warped.\" The MJO is speeding up over the Indian Ocean and slowing down over northern Australia.The MJO now spends five to six more days over northern Australia per cycle, and we found that this is the cause of the increasing rainfall trend.To do this, we explored how rainfall trends have been changing with and without the presence of the MJO. We found that when the MJO is absent, the rainfall in northwest Australia has actually been decreasing in many areas in the northwest. The increase in rainfall was only present when the MJO was over northwest Australia.The MJO has led to more days with rainfall and more total rainfall each monsoon. This trend is so large that in some regions the rainfall associated with the MJO has been increasing by 15%\u201325% per decade.The rainfall associated with the MJO has not become more intense; rather, because it spends more time over northwest Australia, there are just more days with rainfall.While this rainfall trend has been observed since the 1950s, in our study we were only able to analyze this relationship back to the late 1970s, as accurate detection of the MJO requires satellite data.It's going to keep getting wetterClimate simulations show that the MJO will continue to drive increasing rainfall in northwest Australia. Under a high emissions scenario, where there is little effort to reduce greenhouse gases, northern Australia will receive 12% more rainfall on average across northern Australia.All of the rainfall increase is expected to be due to the MJO, with less rainfall occurring when the MJO is not present.However, under low-emission scenarios, the pattern stabilizes and the predicted rainfall increase almost disappears.The increasing rainfall trends observed in northwest Australia have significant implications for the region's ecosystems, communities, and industries. Understanding the cause of these trends is important for the health of ecosystems and agriculture in northwest Australia.

  "answer_squad": " you can't see it",
  "text": "As the third-busiest Memorial Day weekend since 2000 approaches, kicking off a summer travel season that AAA predicts will be one for the record books, particularly at airports, travelers are encouraged to pack their patience and buckle in for what may be a bumpier ride than usual.          While flying has long presented myriad challenges, including long lines at security checkpoints and ever-changing baggage standards, experts point to a new and perhaps even larger concern\u2014an uptick in airplane turbulence.Research has shown there has been a major increase in the number of severe turbulence cases on flights both domestic and international. Some of these instances have even resulted in injuries to both passengers and flight attendants along with feelings of extreme panic, anxiety and foreboding.Dr. Ramalingam Saravanan, professor and head of the Texas A&M Department of Atmospheric Sciences, explained that clear-air turbulence is especially concerning because it is nearly impossible to predict its frequency.\"The main problem is that you can't see it,\" Saravanan said. \"The best way I think pilots know about it is when some other pilot has flown through it and radios back, letting them know its location. You can try to predict it statistically, but you can't predict it by individual case because it is a random process, and the air looks clear and harmless\u2014hence the name.\"But what does this have to do with climate change?One major cause of violent turbulence is the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which have accumulated at an historically high rate during the past year. They are released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of everyday activities like driving cars or burning gas and oil, leading to inconsistent wind speeds that can cause clear-air turbulence.Saravanan noted that greenhouse gases\u2014namely carbon dioxide and methane\u2014act like a blanket for the earth's surface, trapping the heat that it emits and distorting both the troposphere and stratosphere, thereby increasing the occurrence of clear-air turbulence.\"Greenhouse gases warm the lower part of the atmosphere called the troposphere, which is where we live, and cool the stratosphere, which is where most planes fly,\" Saravanan explained. \"The strength of the wind depends on the gradient of the temperature between the pole and the equator. In the stratosphere, this effect is reversed, and that leads to increased wind shear and turbulence.\"Regardless of the unpredictability or inconvenience, air travel isn't going anywhere. Given the increase in clear-air turbulence, Saravanan said airlines will be required to look into longer-than-usual flight routes, resulting in higher ticket prices.\"Airlines employ aviation meteorologists who predict the winds and plot the path to minimize the headwind and increase the tailwind, because when wind is blowing against you, you try to avoid it and go around it,\" Saravanan said. \"Because it costs money to burn fuel, airlines will add clear-air turbulence predictions to flight routes, which could cost a little more and could lengthen the path.\"According to Saravanan, the issue regarding rising levels of greenhouse gases in the environment can lead to bigger problems than those affecting air travel, such as intense rainfall that could cause flooding, increased droughts, stronger storms and winds, and especially rising sea levels.As one possible solution, Saravanan said we can all make more of a conscious effort to decrease our individual carbon footprints.\"Greenhouse gases are being omitted as we speak, and that's because people drive, use heating, air conditioning, etc.,\" Saravanan said. \"By using energy more efficiently and switching to renewable sources, you'll reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. It's a difficult process, but it's what we need to do to minimize climate change.\" Provided byTexas A&M UniversityCitation:Climate scientist explains increase in airplane turbulence (2023, May 26)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-climate-scientist-airplane-turbulence.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "NASA has launched the final pair of a satellite quartet designed to track tropical cyclones hour by hour, in a project that could improve weather predictions on devastating storms.          The storm trackers, sent into orbit on a rocket built by US company Rocket Lab and launched from New Zealand's Mahia Peninsula early Friday, completed the TROPICS constellation of shoebox-sized satellites.They can fly over hurricanes (or typhoons in the Pacific) every hour, compared to every six hours with current satellites.\"As a lifelong Floridian, I know firsthand how critical it is for millions of Americans to have timely and accurate forecasts for hurricanes,\" NASA administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement.\"More intense rainfall and increased coastal flooding are devastating livelihoods and taking lives, demonstrating the importance of NASA's cutting-edge science to help answer questions that nobody else can.\"The first pair of satellites were launched successfully earlier this month.The information gathered on rainfall, temperature and humidity could help scientists determine where a hurricane will make landfall and how intense it will be, helping people living in coastal areas be better prepared for possible evacuations.In the long term, a better understanding of the formation and evolution of these storms could help improve climate models.The constellation was originally intended to have six satellites, not four, but the first two were lost when a US Astra rocket malfunctioned shortly after lift-off last year.Hurricanes, or typhoons, are becoming more powerful as the ocean surface warms, scientists say.Hurricane Ian, which devastated Florida in 2022, killed dozens of people and caused more than $100 billion in damage, making it by far the world's most expensive weather disaster of the year.The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Thursday predicted a \"near normal\" hurricane season with 12 to 17 named storms packing winds of at least 39 mph (63 kph).After three seasons with an atmospheric phenomenon called La Nina, which worsens hurricanes in the Atlantic, NOAA predicts an El Nino to develop this summer, which has a suppressive effect on hurricane activity.But this could be offset by more localized conditions favorable for hurricanes, such as an above-normal west African monsoon, \"which produces African easterly waves and seeds some of the stronger and longer-lived Atlantic storms,\" NOAA said.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:NASA launches final pair of storm tracker satellite quartet (2023, May 26)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-nasa-pair-storm-tracker-satellite.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "In a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Prof. Xiao Yilin's group from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) quantitatively determined, for the first time, the chemical composition of supercritical fluids in deep subduction zones. Through 3D imaging modeling of ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) multiphase fluid inclusions, they revealed the important role of supercritical fluids in the cycling of carbon and sulfur in subduction zones, which is of great importance for an in-depth and systematic understanding of the role of supercritical fluids in nature.          Fluids, including oceans, lakes, rivers, and the wide range of geological fluids found in the Earth's interior, are inseparable parts, helping to transfer their matter and energy among different layers of the Earth. Depending on their geochemical properties, they can be further divided into water-rich fluids, water-bearing melts, and supercritical fluids.Formed amidst high temperature and pressure, supercritical fluids are characterized by relatively low viscosity, high activity, and exceptional elemental mobility. These unconventional physicochemical properties endow them with a vital role in triggering meso-deep seismicity and volcanism, facilitate subduction zone elemental transport, material cycling, and metal enrichment mineralization, and influence the evolution of the Earth's habitability. However, it remains a challenge to identify a supercritical fluid activity from natural samples, especially when the critical and quantitative geochemical indicators are severely scarce.The researchers studied the UHP metamorphic vein body of the continental ultra-deep subduction zone in the Dabie Mountains, and found a large number of multiphase fluid inclusions coexisting with the iconic UHP metamorphic mineral, Kochnite. The inclusions are preserved with multiple seed minerals with a relatively consistent overall assemblage, consisting mainly of quartz, calcite, anhydrite, and a large amount of water.Systematic petrographic, laser Raman and elemental surface sweep studies showed that the multiphase fluid inclusions in omphacite and garnet are primary UHP fluid inclusions, preserving the chemical composition of the deeper high-pressure fluids in the subduction zone intact. 3D laser Raman modeling and quantitative compositional calculations of these inclusions recovered the original vein-forming fluid composition recorded in the multiphase fluid inclusions. The fluids were shown to contain mainly SiO2, CaO, and water, as well as significant amounts of volatile elements such as carbon and sulfur.Furthermore, the researchers discovered that fluids preserved in the inclusions have supercritical properties (e.g., migration capacity) and compositional characteristics. These supercritical fluids are highly efficient in activating and transporting carbon and sulfur in subduction zone sheets, and may transport them into the mantle wedge and even the deep mantle, thus having a wide and important impact on the efficiency and flux of the carbon-sulfur cycle between the Earth's surface and the deep, as well as the evolution of the habitability of the Earth.This study provided a detailed characterization of the properties of supercritical fluids in deep subduction zones. It also revealed the critical role the UHP fluids played in terms of carbon and sulfur cycle, which has long been underestimated.

  "text": "A research team has carried out a study on paleoclimatic evolution, volcanic activity and its socio-ecological impact in the Garrotxa Volcanic Field (Girona). The results of the paleoenvironmental study have been published in the journals The Holocene and Scientific Reports . The Autonomous University of Barcelona, the University of Burgos, the IPHES-CERCA, the IDAEA-CSIC, the University of Valencia and the University of Montpellier participated in the study.          The study, carried out on a 14-meter deep borehole in the Vall d'en Bas (Girona), has revealed interesting and unpublished data on the paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental evolution of the Garrotxa Volcanic Field. It shows that its volcanic activity extended to only 8,300 years ago (until now it was thought that volcanism ceased about 13,000 years ago), which constitutes the most recent volcanism in the entire Iberian Peninsula.\"It has been possible to document eruptions almost 5,000 years more recent than those recorded so far in the area, which were considered the most recent in the Iberian Peninsula, and it has been possible to characterize in detail for the first time both the social and environmental impact that to have these eruptions,\" explains the researcher of the Department of Prehistory of the UAB Maria Sa\u00f1a, one of the main authors of the study.This volcanic activity caused several lava flows to close the Fluvi\u00e0 river valley near Olot, and a large lake was formed in the plain that today is known as Pla de les Preses. The sediments that were deposited in this ancient lake surrounded by volcanoes, which include numerous layers of volcanic ash and lapilli, have been studied by different specialists through the analysis of sedimentary, paleoclimatic and biological indicators such as chronostratigraphy, sedimentology , pollen, ostracods, lake algae or diatoms. All this has made it possible to reconstruct the paleoclimatic evolution of the last 13,000 years in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, the volcanism of La Garrotxa and the impact of these eruptions on plant and lake ecosystems,The sedimentary sequence of the studied borehole records local and regional signals related to the geomorphological, paleoclimatological and volcanic dynamics of the Garrotxa volcanic field. The analyzed geological and biological indicators, aquatic organisms, pollen record, sedimentology and geochemistry mainly report local hydrological variations, which have been linked to the main climatic trends of the Holocene and late Pleistocene, including several abrupt climate changes that offer clues about the processes that could be triggered in the context of current global warming.In the area closest to the zone of volcanic activity (up to 50 km) and during volcanic eruption events, different processes such as lava flows, deposition of volcanic materials, ash rain, emanation of gases and aerosols and pyroclastic flows and earthquakes, affected flora and fauna (bioresources), as well as air and water quality, and constituted a danger to human populations.\"One of the objectives of the research has been to evaluate the dynamics of neolithization in several areas of the Eastern Pre-Pyrenees, including Garrotxa and specifically also in the Vall d'en Bas and the Llierca valley, the area where they have been documented the Mesolithic occupations contemporary to the episodes of volcanism,\" says Maria Sa\u00f1a.In this sense, and from the study of nearby archaeological sites, it is observed that the nearest hunter-gatherer populations left the area temporarily during periods of high volcanic activity, to return later in times of stillness, demonstrating a high capacity for reorganization and adaptation. \"The abandonment of the volcanic area could take place for hundreds of years,\" Sa\u00f1a specifies.The published works show, in great detail, the paleoenvironmental evolution of the NE of the Iberian Peninsula and the socio-ecological impact of the volcanism that took place in La Garrotxa. In addition, they highlight the interest in developing interdisciplinary paleoecological research, which analyzes all the processes involved in the transformations of the landscape caused by volcanism and allows a better understanding of their repercussions.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards the new study?",
  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the social discount rate recommended for?",
  "answer_squad": " 2%",
  "text": "A new study shows that philosophers with expertise on social discounting and intergenerational distribution want to put more emphasis on the conditions of future generations in climate economic calculations. But they fundamentally agree with economists on one of the key parameters.          How do we value the costs of climate change, which may not be fully materialized for one or two generations? And how much climate action should we do today without wasting resources?These are some of the questions that economics try to answer in climate economic modeling, and in this context the choice of the social discount rate is crucial. The higher the rate, the more you write down future benefits and costs in areas such as climate change. Conversely, if the discount rate is kept low, more weight is given to the challenges of the future and more climate investments with a long time horizon will make economic sense.There is a growing consensus among economists to keep the social discount rate around 2%. Now, a new international study shows that many philosophers with expertise on the topic share this recommendation (see image above).  The study used a survey to investigate views on the use of discount rates in climate economic models among philosophers with expertise in discounting. A total of 29 philosophers participated in the study, which follows up on a similar survey among economists. The study is published in Nature Climate Change.This suggests a consensus across two disciplines as different as economics and philosophy on one of the most important parameters in climate economic modeling. This also means that the UN's target of keeping global warming below two degrees is in fact economically optimal when the recommended social discount rate is applied in a recent update to the leading climate economic model (DICE).The study follows a similar survey of economists. The new survey, which presents the recommendations of philosophers with expertise in discounting, shows that they are more willing to emphasize the ethical aspects involved in long-term issues such as climate change.It is perhaps less surprising that philosophers focus more on ethics than economists. Still, it is important to account for ethical considerations when economists model far ahead in the future. As Frikk Nesje, Assistant Professor at the Department of Economics and first author of the study, explains:\"For example, how should we weigh the concerns of future generations, and how should we approach the choice between consuming more now or rather in the future? Such questions have an ethical component that many economists today are fully aware of, but not always the best to answer.\"      Philosophers bring new perspectives to climate economic modelsFew philosophers have expertise in discounting compared to economists, and the survey has on the global level only identified 46 relevant philosophers in the field, most of whom, 29, responded to the questionnaire. Of these, almost half did not answer the question on the appropriate level of the social discount rate.However, almost all respondents have provided written remarks. And while many agree with economists on the numerical value of the social discount rate, philosophers generally express a reluctance to reduce economic modeling of long-term issues such as climate change to a question of economic parameters and classical utility considerations.One respondent points out that the present generation has an ethical obligation not to harm future generations and suggests a very low discount rate. Conversely, another emphasizes that it is morally acceptable and sometimes even required \"to give greater weight to the concerns of those nearer and dearer to us than to those further away.\"Both examples represent ethical considerations, which should play a greater role in the climate-economic modeling. Economists shouldn't have a monopoly on policy recommendations, says Nesje.\"The aspects highlighted by the philosophers are already part of the public discourse. For example, the administration of U.S. President Biden has been advised to take non-economic inputs into account when revising the social discount rate. But it is interesting in itself to know what other disciplines think about the issues we are working on.\" More information:Frikk Nesje et al, Philosophers and economists agree on climate policy paths but for different reasons, Nature Climate Change (2023).

  "answer_squad": " AABW",
  "text": "Antarctica is a unique landscape, full of mystery and wonder. Its environments have a huge impact on the rest of the planet\u2014on the climate, the ocean and on life itself.          About 250 trillion metric tons of salty, oxygen-rich, and dense water sinks near Antarctica each year. This is known as Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). The process of sinking drives a global network of currents. Newly formed AABW fills up to 40% of the total volume of the world's ocean. Much like the way a lung pumps oxygen into our blood, AABW transports oxygen\u2014as well as carbon and nutrients\u2014into the deep Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.But a new study led by CSIRO researcher Dr. Kathy Gunn, shows this sinking of dense water has slowed. And, with this, deep ocean oxygen levels have also declined. The research is published in the journal Nature Climate Change.\"Our observations show the deep ocean circulation around Antarctica has slowed overall by about 30% since the 1990s. This slowdown locks in decades of impacts,\" Kathy said.This slowdown happened because increased melting of Antarctica's glaciers made surface waters less salty, and therefore more buoyant. This means there is less dense water sinking from the surface to the depths. The interruption of a key process that replenishes the deep ocean with oxygen has effects that reach far beyond the immediate sea.What changes can we expect?The results of the study show the deep ocean circulation is declining at a rate that models predicted wouldn't happen until about 2050.Professor Matthew England, co-author and Deputy Director of the Australian Center for Excellence in Antarctic Science, said recent modeling suggested that under the IPCC high emissions scenario the flow of AABW would slow by more than 40% by 2050.\"But these latest observations suggest the projected slowdown is in fact already well underway,\" Matthew said.And, as this circulation slows down, the bottom of the oceans start to stagnate.\"This would trap nutrients in the deep ocean, reducing the nutrients available to support marine life near the ocean surface,\" he said.Co-author Dr. Steve Rintoul, from our Australian Antarctic Program Partnership, said there are further impacts.\"We're used to the idea that melting of the Antarctic Ice Sheet causes sea level rise. But this work also shows us that the impacts of melting glaciers in Antarctica extend all the way to the deep sea, affecting climate and ocean chemistry, as well as sea level,\" Steve said.      Measuring the mysterious Southern OceanNot much is known about the Southern or Antarctic Oceans compared to other oceans. However, the oceans buffer the worst impacts of climate change by absorbing at least 90% of the excess heat trapped in Earth's atmosphere.Kathy and her team have now developed a new method of measuring the deep circulation in the Southern Ocean. From this, they have achieved the first observation-based estimates of how the volume transport of AABW has changed.\"AABW is formed close to Antarctica, so one of the only ways to get there and directly observe its changes is by ship,\" Kathy said.She said repeated full-depth measurements from ships are the gold standard of data acquisition for the deep seas. But these measurements have only been repeated about once every 10 years since the 1970s.\"And because the bottom water is so deep, it's very hard to measure by other means,\" Kathy said. \"We are talking depths of up to 6,000 meters. The data that we regularly collect goes only to 2,000 meters.\"This means data on the deep Southern Ocean is scarce. But researchers still noticed volumes of AABW were getting smaller.\"The ship measurements showed us that the bottom water layer was shrinking at several locations,\" Kathy said.\"But we didn't know exactly what was causing it.\"                An instrument was deployed from the side of a ship to collect temperature, salinity and pressure readings in the ocean. Credit: Dr. Steve Rintoul.             So how did they do it?To discover how and why the deep ocean was changing, the team combined the ship observations with water speed, temperature and salinity measurements from moored instruments. The moorings were attached to wires anchored to the seabed, with floats at the top, and left for up to two years at a time. Using models to fill any data gaps, the researchers could then calculate the volume and oxygen transport of the AABW.Co-author Dr. Melissa Bowen from the University of Auckland said the novelty of the method is combining a variety of observational data with realistic model simulations.\"The data is limited in space, but it shows us what is really happening in the ocean,\" Melissa said.\"The simulation, on the other hand, is not able to reproduce the real ocean exactly, but it can tell us about the nature of the ocean currents where measurements were not available.\"By combining what the flow looks like in space from the simulation with the changes in time from the moorings, we use the best information from both,\" she said.The team focused on the Australian Antarctic Basin, because it has historically shown large changes in AABW, and is most likely to provide an emergent \"early-warning\" sign.Melissa said the mooring location within the Australian Antarctic Basin is at its gateway with the Ross Sea.\"Here we can see dense water pulsing with the tides and fluctuating as its density changes,\"Melissa said.She said the method they've developed can continue to provide estimates of AABW.Where to now?The freshening around Antarctica is expected to continue, even accelerate, as the Antarctic Ice Sheet responds to and melts under a rapidly warming climate. But it's not all bad news.\"We also found an increase in shelf water salinity between 2009 and 2018, which drove a partial recovery,\" Kathy said.She says this recovery provides further motivation to continue to work hard in reducing global carbon emissions.\"It's all to do with salinity. The salinification and recovery of the circulation shows that the mechanisms can work in both directions,\" she said.\"So, if freshening reduces, then some of the deep overturning circulation could be recovered.\"But, for now, the overall decline is already changing the deep ocean's structure and chemistry.\"The slowdown means we are already committed to a certain amount of change that will play out across the next few decades,\" Kathy said.

  "text": "A strong 6.2-magnitude quake shook buildings in Tokyo on Friday, but no tsunami warning was issued and there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.          The earthquake hit off the coast of the Chiba region, east of the Japanese capital, just after 7 pm (1000 GMT), according to the country's meteorological agency.Train services were stopped briefly in the area and runways at Narita Airport, an international gateway to Tokyo, were closed temporarily when the jolt hit.No abnormalities were detected at nuclear plants in the wider region, the national nuclear authority said.The Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake had a depth of 50 kilometres (31 miles). The US Geological Survey gave it the same magnitude and a similar depth of 44 kilometres.Moments before Tokyo residents felt shaking, the nation's advance warning system for earthquakes prompted television networks to alert the arrival of a potentially large shake.\"It was like being on a boat floating on water\u2014sideways rocking that seemed to go on for more than 30 seconds,\" said a presenter on public broadcaster NHK.Japan has strict construction regulations intended to ensure buildings can withstand strong quakes, and routinely holds emergency drills to prepare for major disasters.In early May, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck central Ishikawa region, leaving one person dead and 49 injured.The country is haunted by the memory of a massive 9.0-magnitude undersea quake off northeastern Japan in March 2011, which triggered a tsunami that left around 18,500 people dead or missing.The 2011 tsunami also sent three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant, causing Japan's worst post-war disaster and the most serious nuclear accident since Chernobyl.Tokyo's population is estimated at around 14 million, with tens of millions more people living in conjoining metropolitan areas including the megacity of Yokohama.The Japanese capital was devastated by a huge earthquake a century ago in 1923.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Magnitude 6.2 quake hits east of Tokyo, no tsunami warning (2023, May 26)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-magnitude-quake-east-tokyo-tsunami.html  This document is subject to copyright.

Of those, five to nine could become hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including one to four major hurricanes (category 3, 4 or 5; with winds of 111 mph or higher).NOAA said it has 70 percent confidence in these ranges.\"With a changing climate, the data and expertise NOAA provides to emergency managers and partners to support decision-making before, during and after a hurricane has never been more crucial,\" said NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad in a statement.The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30, with NOAA predicting a 40 percent chance of a near-normal season, a 30 percent chance of an above-normal season and a 30 percent chance of a below-normal season.After three seasons with an atmospheric phenomenon called La Nina, NOAA predicts an El Nino to develop this summer, which has a suppressive effect on hurricane activity.But this could be offset by more localized conditions favorable for hurricanes, such as an above-normal west African monsoon, \"which produces African easterly waves and seeds some of the stronger and longer-lived Atlantic storms,\" NOAA said.Predicted warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea meanwhile add more energy to developing storms.In 2022, Hurricane Ian in particular devastated Florida, killing dozens and causing more than $100 billion in damage alone\u2014by far the costliest weather disaster in the world last year.In general, climate change is making hurricanes more powerful as they feed on warmer ocean surfaces, scientists say.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:US predicts at least 12 named storms this hurricane season (2023, May 26)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-storms-hurricane-season.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_squad": " California buckwheat",
  "text": "In an industrial wasteland in Los Angeles, Kreigh Hampel is uprooting California buckwheat with a pitchfork to find out how much lead it has absorbed.          The plant's delicate white and pink flowers belie an astonishing cleaning power, which scientists think could be harnessed to get rid of dangerous pollutants\u2014and even recycle them.\"That's the miracle of life,\" enthuses 68-year-old Hampel, who is volunteering on the project.\"Plants really can do this work and they know how to do it, they've done it so many times over millions of years,\" he says.The experiment is part of a project run by University of California Riverside which has scattered carefully selected plants and fungi on this former industrial site in the hope of getting rid of the heavy metals and petrochemicals that have contaminated the area for decades.Danielle Stevenson, who is leading the study, says such bioremediation techniques can be much more cost-effective than traditional techniques.\"The conventional method of cleaning up sites is just to dig up all the contaminated soil and to dump it somewhere else,\" she told AFP.\"That approach doesn't actually solve the problem, right? It just moves it somewhere else.\" And, she says, it costs a lot of money.Stevenson's project, which is being carried out on three sites in and around Los Angeles, has a price tag of around $200,000 and so far is showing very promising results.                California buckwheat is particularly good at absorbing heavy metals like lead.             Solar-powered vacuum cleaners\"In three months, we had a 50 percent reduction of the petrochemicals and then in six months, we were getting pretty close (to that level) with some of the metals,\" she said.Stevenson, a mycologist by training, has chosen her anti-pollution weapons with care.Oyster mushrooms have been incorporated into the soil because of their natural role in decomposition: Their underground part, called the mycelium, is sucking up diesel.\"Those same fungi that in nature would eat a dead tree will also recognize diesel oil, for example, as a food source.\"The reason is, it's basically the same thing. A lot of our fossil fuels are just dead stuff that got compressed over long periods of time.\"Several California native plants, including the telegraph weed and the California bush sunflower, are particularly good at absorbing heavy metals.                Researcher Danielle Stevenson says she thinks of the plants a little like solar-powered vacuum cleaners.             Stevenson thinks of the plants essentially as \"solar powered vacuum cleaners: They basically suck up the metals, like lead, into their bodies.\"When we pull out the plants, we've removed the lead from the soil.\"The lead and other metals can then be recovered from those plants\u2014and even reused.Throughout the United States and the industrialized world, commercial sites that outlive their useful life to the companies that pollute them are often just abandoned, says Stevenson.The responsibility to put them right falls on poorly funded or ill-equipped local authorities, who struggle to find the money or the expertise.Historically the problem is worse in working class or ethnic minority neighborhoods, where politicians feel more able to ignore complaints.In the United States, where the Environmental Protection Agency lists nearly 1,900 problem sites, only a small number of clean-up projects are carried out each year, Stevenson says.She hopes that a cheaper method will enable more sites to be cleaned up.                Danielle Stevenson's bioremediation project is being carried out on three sites in and around Los Angeles.             'The Last of Us'Advocates say bioremediation's uses are not limited to fixing former industrial sites. The process can also be used to help clean up the toxic ash left by some wildfires\u2014an annual problem in fire-prone California.So why is this technique still so underdeveloped?\"Bioremediation is still considered risky,\" explains Bill Mohn, professor of microbiology at the University of British Columbia in Canada.Unlike soil excavation, \"it's hard to guarantee that you will systematically reach the level of pollutants that are required.\"Whereas, we know that if you dig up the soil and send it to somebody who will take it if you pay them, then you've solved your problem.\"Stevenson, meanwhile, points to unhealthy prejudices about mushrooms\u2014think of the terrifying fungi that infect the zombies of the HBO smash series \"The Last of Us.\"                Scientists are carefully measuring how much the plants have grown and what they have absorbed.             \"I get asked all the time: 'If you introduce a fungus to clean up a site, is it going to take over, eat our house and take over the world?'\" she says.It won't, she is quick to add.But that is why it is important to be conducting this kind of experiment in a real-world setting, not just in a laboratory.\"I think once we get more field tests of these methods, people will feel more confident choosing some of these approaches,\" she says.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Fungi and plants clean up California pollution (2023, May 26)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-fungi-california-pollution.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Squinting in the bright light of a hot summer morning, Vu Thi Thinh perches on the edge of her small wooden boat and plucks a polystyrene block from the calm waters of Vietnam's Ha Long Bay.          It's not yet 9 am, but a mound of styrofoam buoys, plastic bottles and beer cans sit behind her.They are the most visible sign of the human impacts that have degraded the UNESCO World Heritage Site, famed for its brilliant turquoise waters dotted with towering rainforest-topped limestone islands.\"I feel very tired because I collect trash on the bay all day without much rest,\" said Thinh, 50, who has been working for close to a decade as a trash picker.\"I have to make five to seven trips on the boat every day to collect it all.\"Since the beginning of March, 10,000 cubic metres of rubbish\u2014enough to fill four Olympic swimming pools\u2014have been collected from the water, according to the Ha Long Bay management board.The trash problem has been particularly acute over the past two months, as a scheme to replace styrofoam buoys at fish farms with more sustainable alternatives backfired and fishermen chucked their redundant polystyrene into the sea.Authorities ordered 20 barges, eight boats and a team of dozens of people to launch a clean-up, state media said.Do Tien Thanh, a conservationist at the Ha Long Bay Management Department, said the buoys were a short-term issue but admitted: \"Ha Long Bay... is under pressure\".\u2014Human waste\u2014More than seven million visitors came to visit the spectacular limestone karsts of Ha Long Bay, on Vietnam's northeastern coast, in 2022.                Ha Long Bay's popularity with tourists, and the rapid growth of nearby Ha Long City, have severely damaged its ecosystem.             Authorities hope that number will jump to eight and a half million this year.But the site's popularity, and the subsequent rapid growth of Ha Long City\u2014which is now home to a cable car, amusement park, luxury hotels and thousands of new homes\u2014have severely damaged its ecosystem.Conservationists estimate there were originally around 234 types of coral in the bay\u2014now the number is around half.There have been signs of recovery in the past decade, with coral coverage slowly increasing again and dolphins\u2014pushed out of the bay a decade ago\u2014coming back in small numbers, as a ban on fishing in the core parts of the heritage site expanded their food source.But the waste, both plastic and human, is still a huge concern.\"There are so many big residential areas near Ha Long Bay,\" said conservationist Thanh.\"The domestic waste from these areas, if not dealt with properly, greatly impacts the ecological system, which includes the coral reefs.\"Ha Long City can now handle just over 40 percent of its wastewater.\"Single-use plastic is now banned on tourist boats, and the Ha Long Bay management board says general plastic use on board is down 90 percent from its peak.But trash generated onshore still lines parts of the beach, with a team of rubbish collectors not able to block the eyesore from tourists.                Rapid economic growth, urbanisation and changing lifestyles in Vietnam have led to a 'plastic pollution crisis', according to the World Bank.             'Plastic pollution crisis'Pham Van Tu, a local resident and freelance tour guide, said he had received a lot of complaints from visitors.\"They read in the media that Ha Long Bay is beautiful, but when they saw a lot of floating trash, they didn't want to swim or go canoeing and they hesitated to tell their friends and family to visit,\" he said.Rapid economic growth, urbanisation and changing lifestyles in communist Vietnam have led to a \"plastic pollution crisis\", according to the World Bank.A report in 2022 estimated 3.1 million tonnes of plastic waste are generated every year, with at least 10 percent leaking into the waterways, making Vietnam one of the top five plastic polluters of the world's oceans.The volume of leakage could more than double by 2030, the World Bank warns.Larissa Helfer, 21, who travelled to Vietnam from her home in Germany, said Ha Long Bay was beautiful but the trash problem would be one of her strongest memories of the trip.\"Normally you (might say) 'Look at the view! Look at the fishing villages!\" she told AFP.But here \"you have to talk about the trash, (you say) 'oh god... look at the plastic bottles and things in the sea.' And it makes you sad.\"Thinh, the trash collector, grew up in Ha Long and remembers a very different bay.\"It didn't look so terrible,\" she said.\"Of course, a lot of work makes me tired and irritated,\" she admitted. \"But we must do our work.\"    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Vietnam battles plastic blight in idyllic Ha Long Bay (2023, May 26)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-vietnam-plastic-blight-idyllic-ha.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "The US Supreme Court dealt a blow on Thursday to the federal government's authority to regulate wetlands under a landmark anti-pollution law.          The nation's highest court ruled in favor of a couple who were stopped by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from building a home near Priest Lake in Idaho because the property abuts federally protected wetlands.The EPA said the Sacketts needed a permit, but the couple's lawyers argued that the 1972 Clean Water Act (CWA) applies only to \"traditional navigable waters\" and they should be allowed to proceed.The court, in a 5-4 vote, said the CWA only concerns wetlands that are connected to larger bodies of water such as oceans, rivers and lakes.\"We hold that the CWA extends to only those wetlands with a continuous surface connection to bodies that are 'waters of the United States' in their own right,\" Justice Samuel Alito said in the majority opinion.\"In sum, the CWA extends to only wetlands that are 'as a practical matter indistinguishable from waters of the United States,\" Alito wrote.President Joe Biden and environmental groups said the ruling was a severe setback to the anti-pollution protections enshrined in the Clean Water Act.\"The Supreme Court's disappointing decision in Sackett v. EPA will take our country backwards,\" Biden said in a statement.\"It puts our Nation's wetlands\u2014and the rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds connected to them\u2014at risk of pollution and destruction, jeopardizing the sources of clean water that millions of American families, farmers, and businesses rely on,\" the president said.\"My team will work with the Department of Justice and relevant agencies to carefully review this decision and use every legal authority we have to protect our Nation's waters for the people and communities that depend on them.\"The Sierra Club denounced the case as a \"corporate polluter-backed effort to dismantle the Clean Water Act by narrowing the definition of the waters of the United States.\"The Court's decision will open millions of acres of wetlands\u2014all formerly protected by the Clean Water Act\u2014to pollution and destruction,\" the Sierra Club said in a statement.The ruling by the conservative-dominated court comes nearly a year after it said the EPA cannot issue broad limits on greenhouse gases, sharply curtailing the power of the Biden administration to battle climate change.The high court, in a 6-3 vote, found that the EPA did not have the power to set sweeping caps on emissions from coal-fired power plants, which produce nearly 20 percent of the electricity consumed in the United States.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:US Supreme Court deals setback to clean water law (2023, May 25)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-supreme-court-setback-law.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_squad": " 24 to 38 inches",
  "text": "The Delaware River could rise well more than a foot by midcentury, and temperatures could heat up nearly 6 degrees, accompanied by a rise in extreme heat days, according to a new report that localized data to create a snapshot of local climate change in Philadelphia.          The report came from a coalition formed in response to rallies and a petition by Drexel University students in 2019 imploring the school to take action on climate change.After the student action, representatives from the city of Philadelphia, Drexel University, the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, and the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University formed the Climate Resilience Research Agenda. The group released a report on the potential impacts of climate change Wednesday during Green Building United's annual sustainability symposium, which was held this year at Drexel.Some areas will be impacted more than others, said Franco Montalto, a Drexel engineering professor who coedited the report. For example, communities such as Philadelphia's Eastwick section are already vulnerable to flooding. Other parts of the city are more affected by heat waves.Montalto said changing patterns could also impact the urban forest, wetlands, and floodplains.\"The groups raised a bunch of questions about the built environment, about transportation systems about energy systems, buildings, and what we need to know to make those systems continue to function despite climate change,\" he said.The city is already seeing an increase in precipitation, the report noted, and six of the 10 wettest years on record have occurred since 1990. Average annual precipitation has increased over the last century, and variability of amounts has become more pronounced.For the report, the Consortium for Climate Risk in the Urban Northeast extrapolated climate modeling data compiled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to form local models. The United Nations panel has been compiling climate change data for more than 30 years. It released its sixth assessment last year with updated data.Projections call for an increase of 5% to 12% in precipitation by the 2050s, using a baseline period of 1981 to 2010. Precipitation is expected increase by 8% to 16% by the 2080s. Rangers could be higher or lower depending on whether carbon emissions increase, decrease, or stay the same.      The report acknowledges that the frequency and intensity of rainstorms are harder to project. But they noted the big impact of Hurricane Isaias that walloped Southwest Philadelphia in August 2020 and the remnants of Hurricane Ida that flooded the Vine Street Expressway when the Schuylkill overflowed its banks in September 2021.The tidal Delaware River, which reaches to Trenton, rose at the rate of about 1.2 inches per decade over the last century. The trend is expected to continue with sea level projected to rise in Philadelphia anywhere in a low to high range of 7 to 11 inches by the 2030s, 14 to 19 inches by the 2050s, and 24 to 38 inches by the 2080s.The increases would likely cause more high-tide flooding even when there is no rain.The high-end estimate for sea level rise by the 2080s is 45 inches, according to the report, and, by 2100, could rise much as 64 inches.\"As the sea level in the Delaware River Estuary continues to rise, it will also push salty and brackish water upriver causing impacts to ecosystems and water treatment facilities designed to only accommodate fresh water,\" the report states.Philadelphia draws all of its drinking water from its two freshwater rivers: the Schuylkill and Delaware. The Baxter treatment plant is on the Delaware River in Philly's Torresdale section. The current salt front is just below Wilmington. The highest on record occurred during a drought in the 1960s when the salt line encroached roughly parallel to Camden.Using weather observed at Philadelphia International Airport, 8 of the 10 hottest years on record have occurred since 2000, according to the report.Further, average annual temperatures are projected to increase in the middle range by 4.1 to 5.8 degrees by the 2050s, and by 5.5 to 9.4 degrees by the 2080s.Over the same period, the frequency and intensity of hot days and heat waves is also projected to increase. For example, by the 2050s, the numbers of days with maximum temperatures at or above 95, which currently happens about 6 days a year, are projected to grow to 21 to 34 days by the 2050s.The frequency of heat waves, defined as three or more consecutive days with maximum temperatures at or above 90 degrees, may triple by the end of the century. Currently, there are on average three heat waves a year. That could grow to nine.The Climate Resilience Research Agenda team is made up of 100 people, half of whom are academics and others from government, nonprofits, and community groups, Montalto said.\"We asked them to deliberate about what knowledge gaps keep this region from being able to thrive as climate changes,\" Montalto said. \"The idea was that it's not just about how to reduce emissions or deal with sea level rise. But it was about the broader set of things that come together.\"Subgroups began hashing out questions including the impact on water, air quality, human health, and the environment. Montalto said the groups also delved into how climate change will impact buildings, transportation systems, and infrastructure.The report is \"only a first step,\" Montalto said.    2023 The Philadelphia Inquirer, LLC.

  "text": "After months of using weed-killers, saws, shovels and hand-yanking invasive latherleaf fern out of a tropical forest on Virginia Key Beach Park, City of Miami parks naturalist Gloria Alejandra Antia was finally able to begin the process of rebuilding.          Antia dug a hole and planted a small native tree just steps from the shoreline.\"The health of this island, the health of this ecosystem is crucial for our homes, it protects the mainland,\" Antia said.Sand dunes and tropical hardwood hammocks like this one along the coast of South Florida are home to rare plants and animals found nowhere else in the world. They are also disappearing habitats threatened mostly by development and population growth but also natural disasters. A devastating scouring from Hurricane Andrew in 1992 opened the native forest on Virginia Key to invasive plants that profoundly changed the ecosystem on the barrier island.That's not good for people either. Healthy dunes and coastal or maritime forests are natural defenses against both hurricane storm surge and sea-rise, absorbing water and pounding waves. Virginia Key, a barrier island between the Atlantic Ocean and Biscayne Bay, acts as a buffer for mainland Miami and restoration projects like this may become important parts of plans to protect South Florida from flood waters driven by climate change.\"When we create natural habitats we can work with nature,\" said Rachel Silverstein, scientist and founder of Miami Waterkeeper, a clean water advocacy non-profit partnering with Miami's parks and recreation department in the project. \"If we can do green infrastructure and support nature to provide the benefits it provides naturally when it's healthy, it will increase in its value and protection over time.\"Silverstein hopes more nature-based solutions such as restoration of coral reefs, dune systems, and hardwood hammocks make their way into the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' revised storm surge plan for Miami. She was among the environmentalists that opposed an initial billion-dollar plan that included a 30-foot tall,mile-long flood wall along the bay, which would also cut some residential neighborhoods in half, as well as flood gates across the Miami River, Little River and Biscayne Canal. Mayor Daniella Levine Cava put a stop to the Army Corps' proposal and a new resiliency plan is due in August.      \"We are having a once-in-a-generation funding situation and we have to get it right,\" Silverstein said. \"If we just default to putting up pumps and walls and storm gates everywhere we are going to end up with a place that we don't even want to live.\"Though the Miami-Dade Parks and Recreation department naturalist division is helping direct the Virginia Key project, it's made up of only six people, and the ongoing work depends largely on once-a-month volunteer crews. Earlier this month, the volunteers included Elevate Prize Foundation winners, who were flown to Miami from around the world for a summit that included a day of service.One volunteer, Nelly Cheboi, said she planned to apply lessons she learned from the hardwood hammocks off Miami back home to her school in Kenya.\"I see this in Kenya too, our rivers are drying up and there's a lot of deforestation,\" Cheboi said. \"It was a really nice experience to learn ways to plant trees. The way I plant my trees I never take roots out, I always dig too deep.\"The work is taxing. Temperatures were in the 90s and the sun was bearing down on the volunteers as they shoveled wide holes into the sandy ground. But once the project is finished, the trees should fill in the open spaces and create a shaded canopy.Antia said mangrove restoration has been a success at Virginia Key Beach and the forest work is now in a \"maintenance phase.\" Staff and volunteers will return for around three to five years to remove new exotic seedlings that might compete with the native plantings. Native trees, including species like Biscayne prickly-ash, help hold loose soil and slow down erosion. Invasives like Brazilian pepper and latherleaf fern, have weaker root systems and are less resistant to wind and salt water.\"The response from mangroves once we have done the restoration work has been excellent, they are pretty resilient and once you remove exotics they do a good job on their own,\" Antia said.    2023 Miami Herald.

But such prolific snowfall at lower elevations is set to become increasingly rare in coming years as climate change drives temperatures higher, according to new research.In a study published this week, scientists found that mountain snowlines in California have already crept higher, and could rise significantly more if nothing is done to slow the pace of global warming. Researchers projected that from the 2050s to 2100, rising temperatures could push average snowlines 1,300 feet to 1,600 feet higher across the Sierra Nevada and the southern Cascades mountain ranges compared to a century earlier.The research is published in the journal Climate Dynamics.As more precipitation falls as rain instead of snow at lower elevations, the shifting patterns of runoff will pose substantial challenges for water management in California, and for the operation of dams that were designed to capture and store snowmelt.\"Snowlines are rising,\" said Alexander Gershunov, a research meteorologist who co-authored the study with other scientists at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\"If we look towards the end of the century, the snow will be confined to much higher elevations in most years,\" Gershunov said. \"Low-elevation mountains will be more and more likely to be snow-free.\"After examining more than 70 years of snow data, researchers concluded that with unmitigated global warming, California's mountains could lose more than half of their seasonal snow cover.They said the average amount of snow from November through March in the northern Sierra could decrease by more than 70% by the second half of the century, while decreases of about 40% are likely in the higher mountains of the central Sierra and southern Sierra.The research suggests similarly that large increases in the amount of precipitation falling as rain will bring heavier runoff during winter.      That will mean larger flows streaming from the mountains instead of melting off gradually, a trend that is already apparent and will complicate the work of dam managers, Gershunov said.\"It becomes more challenging to balance the need for flood control that reservoirs provide as well as water retention,\" Gershunov said. \"We have to learn how to generate water resources from floodwater.\"For one thing, he said, the trends show why it's important for California to scale up efforts to capture and use floodwaters to replenish groundwater\u2014which state water officials have said is a priority for adapting to more intense swings between drought conditions and bouts of wet weather.The study's authors said even as average snowlines retreat, California will still get big snow years at times.The scientists found that as the planet warms with rising levels of greenhouse gases, more of the snow that falls in the mountains will come in atmospheric rivers, which are warmer and generally have higher snowlines than other winter storms. And according to other research, such storms will grow more potent as temperatures rise, transporting more water vapor.\"At the very high elevations, ironically, we're getting more likely to have unprecedented snow accumulations, because specifically atmospheric river storms are getting wetter,\" Gershunov said.The scientists also looked at how retreating snow lines could affect the skiing industry after 2050 under a scenario of unmitigated warming. They estimated that lower elevation ski areas, such as Northstar California Resort in Truckee, and Palisades-Tahoe in Olympic Valley could lose more than 60% of their average snow accumulation.Higher ski runs, such as those at Mammoth Mountain, in Mammoth Lakes, are projected to have smaller average snow losses.The research brings new insights about the shift to more rain and less snow, including watershed-level projections that could help show where vulnerabilities in water management may lie, said Michael Anderson, state climatologist for the Department of Water Resources. He said this study and other research \"help guide some of the choices that we're making in terms of setting those adaptation strategies to climate change.\"The findings add to other research showing that average snowpacks have been decreasing in most areas of the continental United States, and that large decreases in snow are likely by the end of this century.The latest research adds a focus on snowlines, said Philip Mote, a climate scientist and dean of the graduate school at Oregon State University, who wasn't involved in the study.\"It's no surprise that\u2014this year notwithstanding\u2014a warming climate will generally lead to less snowpack. The questions are how much and how to deal with it,\" Mote said.He said the heavy snowpack of 2023 is \"within normal variability, but big snow years will continue to be rarer.\"\"I expect that in 20 years we'll still be reminiscing about 2023,\" Mote said.Mote pointed out that the study used a high-emissions scenario of global warming, but it looks unlikely for emissions to reach that trajectory, so he expects \"things won't be as bad as this paper describes.\"Gershunov said the authors didn't account for efforts to mitigate climate change.\"There is still an opportunity to reduce some of the impacts that we have identified,\" he said. \"I would like to see both more aggressive climate mitigation globally and better informed climate adaptation locally and regionally, which this type of study should inform.\" More information:Tamara Shulgina et al, Observed and projected changes in snow accumulation and snowline in California's snowy mountains, Climate Dynamics (2023).

  "text": "Satellites are helping Europe protect its lakes, lagoons and rivers.          It is early morning on the Razelm-Sinoe lagoon in Romania when a small boat sets out with instruments and probes. The researchers on board are collecting water samples and measurements to bring to the laboratory for analysis.Located on the shores of the Black Sea, Lake Razelm is part of the most extensive wetland in Europe and of a World Heritage site: the Danube Delta.Close up and afarThe researchers are part of an EU-funded project called CERTO tracking water quality along coasts and in places that transition between fresh and saltwater like lagoons, estuaries and large rivers. The team gets support not just from waterborne transport but also from something much more distant: a satellite network.\"Traditionally, people have gone out in boats and sampled,\" said Professor Steve Groom, CERTO coordinator and head of science/earth observation at Plymouth Marine Laboratory in the UK. \"But it's expensive and they can't be everywhere along the coast on the same day. We're moving towards using satellites to complement in situ monitoring.\"The Razelm-Sinoe lagoon was almost closed off from the Black Sea during the 1970s as part of a plan to create a freshwater source for agriculture.Nowadays it only has one sea inlet. The limited water exchange with the sea, combined with mineral and nutrient run-off from nearby farms, led in the 1990s to excessive plant and algal growth and low-oxygen levels that harmed fish and wildlife in the lagoon.The lagoon's diversity, including varying water depths and levels of salinity, makes for a valuable study site\u2014and the interest is not just academic. Ensuring the health of coastal waters is vital both for ecosystems and for people who make a living from activities such as fishing, farming and tourism.The skyward help that the CERTO researchers receive is through Copernicus, the Earth observation part of the EU's space program. Copernicus uses satellite data to observe water quality and quantity.\"CERTO puts the use of satellite data in the spotlight,\" said Adriana Maria Constantinescu, technical leader of a Razelm-Sinoe lagoon case study. \"We can get good-quality data from satellite images and the work we do in situ helps improve algorithms.\"      Water colorsCERTO is using on-site measurements and satellite-observation data in six places. Among them are also the world-famous lagoon in Venice, Italy and the Curonian lagoon in Lithuania.The project, due to end this September after almost four years, is investigating ways to classify water.\"The technical term is optical water types, but it's really just a way of saying 'this water is a bit muddy' or 'this area is nice and blue,\"' said Groom.The term categorizes bodies of water based on the color of the light they reflect.Murky green ponds, for example, contain more organic matter such as algae than clear ponds and reflect less blue light. Murky water also indicates a surplus of nutrients that could be harmful to fish and wildlife.In this way, using satellites to measure how much light bodies of water reflect can help determine their health without needing to go out in a boat and take samples. It also gives scientists a database to draw on when analyzing waters classified as the same type.\"The value is that you don't necessarily have to take in situ measurements to validate your algorithms everywhere,\" said Groom. \"We're trying to go from lakes all the way to oceans and come up with a common set of water types for all those waters.\"User-friendly infoCERTO also wants to make it easier for scientists to use the available information on water quality and bridge existing gaps in the data.At present three Copernicus services, each using different approaches, provide information on water quality, making it hard for scientists to have an overview. In addition, some areas such as transitional waters aren't covered by any service at all.The project's legacy will be prototype software that can be plugged into existing Copernicus services as well as popular open-source software called SNAP that's used more widely in the research community.Constantinescu, the head of a Razelm-Sinoe study, expects the CERTO work to lead to more research at the lagoon. The filtering properties of reed beds or their role in attenuating wind waves could be some of the nature-based solutions investigated to deal with coastal erosion.Vital groundwater Satellite data is also used to keep an eye on Europe's groundwater.The EU-funded G3P project tracked variations in vital groundwater reserves for three years through 2022.The project used data both from Copernicus and from a joint US-Germany satellite mission known as GRACE that, since its start in 2002, has transformed scientists' view of how water moves and is stored around the planet.\"Groundwater is one of the major resources for humankind,\" said Professor Andreas G\u00fcntner, who coordinated G3P and works at the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam.Groundwater accounts for almost a third of total freshwater resources worldwide. In the EU, it supplies 65% of drinking water and a quarter of water for agricultural irrigation.Groundwater has also been declared an essential climate variable\u2014a critical indicator of how the Earth's climate is changing\u2014by an international non-governmental organization known as the Global Climate Observing System.Copernicus doesn't yet provide consistent, worldwide data on groundwater reserves and how they're evolving.Data wonders The G3P team built a new dataset to fill that gap.The researchers relied on information from GRACE, which has featured twin satellites. An initial GRACE mission lasted 15 years and a follow-up one began in 2018.The distance between the two satellites changes constantly depending on the mass distribution below them. For example, when one approaches heavy masses such as mountains, ice sheets and large groundwater reserves, it speeds up and the distance from the other satellite increases.By tracking the gravitational push and pull on the spacecraft as they fly over different landscapes, scientists were able to map out the distribution of water on and below Earth's surface and how it's changing.Knowing more about groundwater reserves, their changes and how they are affected by human activities such as farming is essential as countries seek to improve the management of water resources generally.\"In some areas of the world, taking water from aquifers for irrigation has led to more withdrawal than replenishment\u2014in other words unsustainable use,\" G\u00fcntner said. \"The first global observation-based groundwater dataset is really an amazing thing.\"Still, plenty more research lies ahead to make greater use of the dataset.\"The next step is in-depth analysis of the groundwater data we obtained to try to understand how groundwater resources have changed over the last 20 years, how those changes may be related to climate change, changing rainfall and how much is due to human interference,\" said G\u00fcntner.

  "text": "Recently, the journal Science China Earth Sciences published a study led by Dr. Wang Huan (Sichuan Normal University) and Professor Zuo Zhiyan (Fudan University). Based on modern observations, historical proxy data, and climate model simulations, this study provides a comprehensive overview of the past, present and future evolution characteristics of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), as well as its impact on the surface air temperature (SAT) at regional and hemispherical scales.          The reconstruction results based on the proxy data indicate that the AMOC has weakened since the late 19th century and experienced overall weakening throughout the 20th century with low confidence. Direct observations show that the AMOC weakened during 2004\u20132016, but it is not possible to distinguish between its decadal variability and long-term trend. Climate models predict that if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, AMOC will weaken in the future, but there will not be a sudden collapse before 2100.For the thermodynamic effects of AMOC, the increased surface heat flux release and meridional heat transport over the North Atlantic associated with the strong AMOC cause an increase in the hemispherical SAT. At the millennial scale, climate cooling (warming) periods correspond to a weakened (strengthened) AMOC.The enhanced MHT of a strong AMOC can affect Arctic warming and thus influence regional SAT anomalies and SAT extremes through mutual feedback between Arctic sea ice and AMOC. In terms of dynamic effects, a strong AMOC modulates the Rossby wave trains originating from the North Atlantic and spreading across mid-to-high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere and causes an increase in the variabilities in the circulation anomalies over the Ural and Siberian regions.Ultimately, a strong AMOC significantly affects the frequencies of extreme cold and warm events in the mid-to-high latitude regions over Eurasia. In addition, AMOC can also influence regional and global SAT anomalies through its dynamic adjustment of planetary-scale circulation. Decadal variation in AMOC is closely related to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).During positive phases of AMO and AMOC, enhanced surface heat fluxes over the North Atlantic lead to abnormal warming in the Northern Hemisphere, while during negative phases, the reverse case occurs.Under high emission scenarios in the future, the possibility of AMOC collapse increases due to freshwater forcing. However, most advanced climate models underestimate the strength of the AMOC and its impact on the AMO and relevant climate change, which presents a major challenge for future understanding and prediction of the AMOC and its climate effects.

  "text": "The scrap of red plastic in among the waterside reeds in northern France could be any fragment of the throwaway consumerism piling up across the planet, flowing into rivers, choking animals, even seeping into our bloodstreams.          But this otherwise unremarkable litter caught in the foliage not far from the mouth of the river Seine has both a name\u2014EF56308\u2014and a history.It was tossed into the water on September 26, 2018, in Rouen, 70 kilometers upstream.Romain Tramoy should know. He threw it.Tramoy, a specialist in sediments, tours the riverbanks making an inventory of the plastic that now splashes garish colors in landscapes once beloved of impressionist painters.Sometimes he marks the plastics with pink or fluorescent yellow paint so he can perhaps find them again one day, somewhere else on their journey towards the sea.\"No waste goes to the sea in a linear way,\" he told AFP, along a riverside strewn with litter.They can hang around \"for years\", flowing from one bank to another, where they snare in the foliage.The scientist, who works at the Water Environment and Urban Systems Laboratory, has spent years studying the life of plastics in the Seine, trying to trace the origins of the trash, how these items can make their way to the sea and how much there is.The Seine River begins its life on the Langres plateau in eastern France before flowing to Paris, where it waters the feet of the Eiffel Tower before wending its way to the city of Rouen and ultimately spilling out into the English Channel.With plastics tossed around by the currents over long periods, the estuary is \"a machine for manufacturing microplastics\", he said.                Romain Tramoy has spent years tracing the itinerant journeys of discarded plastics.             Global scourgeConcern is growing around the world about the potential impacts of this persistent rubbish on ecosystems, people and animals.Microplastic fragments have now been found from the deepest oceans trenches to the top of Mount Everest. In humans, they have been detected in blood, breast milk and placentas.Next week, France will host negotiators from nearly 200 countries for a new round of talks in Paris aimed at reaching a historic, legally binding agreement by next year to end plastic pollution.Global production of the mainly fossil-fuel-based material has doubled in 20 years, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which predicts production could triple again by 2060 without action.France has an advantage over poorer countries when dealing with plastics, Tramoy said.Refuse collection is highly organized and the sewage system is largely effective, other than when there are overflows linked to storms.\"We find much less plastic in the rivers than in countries without collections, and with steep gorges, like in South-East Asia for example,\" Tramoy said.The Seine is also cleaned, notably by the Vinci Construction Maritime et Fluvial group, which collects floating waste. Other organizations focus on shoreline cleanup.But still the plastic gets through.                Map of macroplastic accumulation areas on the banks of the Seine estuary in France, according to the association SOS Mal de Seine.             'Everywhere'As a result of experiments between 2017 and 2020, Tramoy's team estimated that some 100 to 200 metric tons of plastic per year reach the sea along the Seine.That was much fewer than his initial assumptions but it is still enough to keep him busy.Tramoy has placed nets at the exit of storm overflow pipes, which can disgorge into the river after heavy rains.The contents are washed, dried, weighed and listed in his laboratory.This yields an array of plastics\u2014drinks bottles and cigarette butts thrown onto the streets and washed into the sewage system, as well as items flushed directly into toilets.Like an archaeologist of the Anthropocene, the researcher uses certain common products to date the flows of rubbish.One is the small plastic applicator for the single-dose laxative \"microlax\". Enough people flush them down their toilets to make these abundant in the river rubbish and they are each marked with a telltale expiry date.One day in February this year, Tramoy showed AFP some of his earlier finds on a stony bank on the river's edge, tossed up by the tides among driftwood and branches.Detergent bottles, cans, yogurt pots, sweet wrappers, lids, sandals. The items are an inventory of modern consumption.Macro plastics, microplastics, even nanoplastics.\"We find them everywhere,\" he said.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Meandering along the river Seine: France's roving plastic rubbish (2023, May 25)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-meandering-river-seine-france-roving.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Two clashing climatic behemoths, one natural and one with human fingerprints, will square off this summer to determine how quiet or chaotic the Atlantic hurricane season will be.          An El Nino is brewing and the natural weather event dramatically dampens hurricane activity. But at the same time record ocean heat is bubbling up in the Atlantic, partly stoked by human-caused climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas, and it provides boosts of fuel for storms.Many forecasters aren't sure which weather titan will prevail because the scenario hasn't happened before on this scale. Most of them are expecting a near-draw\u2014something about average. And that includes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, saying there's a 40% chance of a near-normal season, 30% chance of an above-average season (more storms than usual) and a 30% chance of a below-normal season.The federal agency Thursday announced its forecast of 12 to 17 named storms, five to nine becoming hurricanes and one to four powering into major hurricanes with winds greater than 110 mph. Normal is 14 named storms, with seven becoming hurricanes and three of them major hurricanes.\"It's definitely kind of a rare setup for this year. That's why our probabilities are not 60% or 70%,\" NOAA lead hurricane seasonal forecaster Matthew Rosencrans said at a Thursday news conference. \"There's a lot of uncertainty this year.\"                Homes are flooded in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, Aug. 30, 2021, in Jean Lafitte, La.

Phillip, File             No matter how many storms brew, forecasters and Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Deanne Criswell reminded U.S. coastal residents from Texas to New England and people in the Caribbean and Central America that it only takes one hurricane to be a catastrophe if it hits you.\"That's really what it boils down to is: Which is going to win or do they just cancel each other out and you end up with a near-normal season?\" said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. \"I respect them both.\"The two forces couldn't be more opposite.El Nino is a natural temporary warming of the Pacific that happens every few years and changes weather worldwide. Climate models predict as the world warms, El Ninos get stronger.Decades of observation show that generally the Atlantic is quieter with fewer storms during El Nino years. El Nino's warmer waters make warmer air over the Pacific reach higher up in the atmosphere, influencing winds and creating strong upper level winds that can decapitate storms, killing them, Klotzbach said. It's called wind shear.                Jeremy Hodges climbs up the side of his family's destroyed storage unit in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, Aug. 30, 2021, in Houma, La.

Phillip, File             El Nino's effects are not direct and \"it's not as in-your-face as a very warm ocean,\" said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy. El Nino and its variations are the single biggest yearly factor in NOAA's forecast, accounting for up to 38% of its prediction, Rosencrans said.The Atlantic, especially hugging the African coast to the far east where storms form, is about 1.8 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (1 to 2 degrees Celsius) warmer than the average of the last 30 years and is the warmest it has been for this time of year, Klotzbach said. Warm Atlantic waters not only make storms stronger and more able to withstand El Nino's shear but they create an opposite direction upper level wind that could counterbalance El Nino.\"It's starting to outpace 2010 by a decent margin, which is sobering because 2010 was stinking hot,\" Klotzbach said.\"The anomalously warm ocean temperatures unquestionably have a human fingerprint on them,\" said former NOAA hurricane scientist Jim Kossin, now of the risk firm The Climate Service.Scientists don't even have past years that look the same to help figure out what will happen, Klotzbach and McNoldy said.

All but a handful of nearly two dozen private, university and government forecast teams and models call for a near normal Atlantic hurricane season with between six and eight hurricanes.But they hedge their bets too.\"AccuWeather is expecting a near normal to slightly below normal season due to the onset of an El Nino,\" said AccuWeather senior hurricane forecaster Dan Kottlowski, who then added that the warm Atlantic complicates everything. \"Due to extensive warm water, there is still a higher than normal chance for a high impacting hurricane to affect the U.S. this season.\"                A home lies collapsed after the beach on which it stood was eroded, following the passage of Hurricane Nicole, Nov. 11, 2022, in Wilbur-By-The-Sea, Fla.

Credit: AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell, File             The University of Arizona looks at the same two clashing forces and sees a different outcome, predicting a higher-than-normal nine hurricanes, 19 named storms and five major hurricanes because it expects \"the Atlantic side to be dominant, leading to a very active season,\" said University of Arizona atmospheric sciences professor Xubin Zeng.Forecasters ran out of names during a record 30 Atlantic named storms in 2020 and with 21 storms in 2021. Last year was normal. Earth had a La Nina for the past three years, which generally increase Atlantic hurricane activity. Hurricane season runs June 1 to November 30.McNoldy said this summer may be quieter in the Caribbean where El Nino's shear can have more sway, but busier in Bermuda and U.S. East Coast north of the Caribbean, where El Nino isn't as potent.Random chance plays a big role, Kossin said: \"It's a bit like rolling dice but with the addition (warm ocean) and subtraction (El Nino) of weights to the dice.\"The warmer Pacific has forecasters expecting a \"near-to-above normal\" hurricane season for waters around Hawaii, said Chris Brenchley, the director of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. That amounts to four to seven tropical cyclones in the region, but fewer could actually come ashore in the islands.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

  "text": "California and Texas textbooks have their differences when it comes to teaching teenagers about American history and the way that subjects like race, gender, and immigration weave through it. But a new Stanford University study has found the two states' U.S. history textbooks are surprisingly similar when dealing with climate change and environmental topics.          Published May 23 in Environmental Education Research, the study analyzed each word and sentence in 30 of the most popular U.S. history textbooks in California and Texas. The results suggest widely used history textbooks in the two states, which strongly influence textbook content nationwide, tend to emphasize controversy in discussions of climate science and prompt students to think about our planet's rapid warming as a matter of opinion or a two-sided issue.Teaching complexity\"When teaching history, it's an important skill for students to be able to consider alternative viewpoints,\" said senior study author Patricia Bromley, an associate professor at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and Stanford Graduate School of Education. \"But the way that this skill is being applied to climate change falsely suggests that the science is undecided.\"Scientific evidence unequivocally shows human activities, mainly through emissions of greenhouse gasses, have caused global warming. The planet's surface temperatures are now 1.1 Celsius (2 Fahrenheit) hotter on average compared to when burning fossil fuels for energy took off in the 1800s.Bromley and lead study author Hannah D'Apice, a Ph.D. student in international comparative education, say a better approach\u2014found in a few of the popular textbooks they analyzed\u2014is to invite students to consider the complex social dimensions of climate impacts and political processes for creating policies, without misrepresenting the scientific consensus around climate change.\"It matters how students are taught to see climate change as a civic issue and integrate scientific information into their understanding of what it means to be an engaged community member and citizen,\" said D'Apice. \"Scientific literacy is really important for social issues, public health, and long-term public well-being.\"      Collective actionBoth states' textbooks shared a tendency to mention corporations' contributions to climate change and environmental damage only in passing, gloss over potential environmental risks of major dams and other public works, and present what the authors describe as an overly limited view of who holds the power to create change.\"Perhaps unsurprisingly, the textbooks primarily discuss government and prominent individual figures as the primary agents that can take action in relation to climate change,\" said Bromley, who also leads the Global Civil Society & Sustainable Development Lab in Stanford's Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society. As future voters, the authors write, students have collective power to elect leaders that seek to address climate change and pressure big polluters to change.\"History and civics curricula are some of the most important tools we have for teaching students to be thoughtful and engaged citizens,\" D'Apice said. \"If we want collective action around climate change, students need to understand not only the scientific consensus, but also the political and social mechanisms they themselves can use to create change.\"AI trained on a new climate dictionaryTo analyze the content, D'Apice and Bromley used a type of artificial intelligence known as natural language processing, which enables computers to perform tasks like measuring sentiment and the relative prevalence of different parts of text.To select relevant text, the researchers first generated a broad list of terms and sentences related to climate change, drawing on glossaries and documents such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. Then they reviewed any words that appeared more than 150 times in the textbook data for additional possible terms. To clean the text, they culled terms such as \"nature\" and \"Industrial Revolution\" that can be related to climate or environment, but which also appeared very frequently in sentences unrelated to those topics.They ultimately came up with a list of 141 terms, ranging from \"greenhouse gas\" and \"pollution\" to \"asthma,\" \"footprint,\" and \"levee failure.\" After an initial scan to remove irrelevant sentences (when \"exhaust\" referred to tiring out, for example, rather than the stuff from a tailpipe), the authors had a final sample of nearly 6,400 sentences. \"In the big picture, when we can computationally look at the whole corpus, there are very few differences between the two states in how climate change is depicted,\" Bromley said.The broad \"climate dictionary\" and the method for refining and analyzing it is now a resource that can be adapted and scaled to measure environmental education worldwide, said Bromley, who is collaborating with groups including the United Nations-backed Mission 4.7 to develop global indicators around education for sustainable development. \"We need more people to start thinking about climate change as something that should be integrated throughout all other aspects of society,\" she said. \"It's not just an issue for science.\" More information:Hannah K.

  "text": "Visually striking layers of burnt orange, yellow, silver, brown and blue-tinged black are characteristic of banded iron formations, sedimentary rocks that may have prompted some of the largest volcanic eruptions in Earth's history, according to new research from Rice University.          The rocks contain iron oxides that sank to the bottom of oceans long ago, forming dense layers that eventually turned to stone. The study published this week in Nature Geoscience suggests the iron-rich layers could connect ancient changes at Earth's surface\u2014like the emergence of photosynthetic life\u2014to planetary processes like volcanism and plate tectonics.In addition to linking planetary processes that were generally thought to be unconnected, the study could reframe scientists' understanding of Earth's early history and provide insight into processes that could produce habitable exoplanets far from our solar system.\"These rocks tell\u2014quite literally\u2014the story of a changing planetary environment,\" said Duncan Keller, the study's lead author and a postdoctoral researcher in Rice's Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences. \"They embody a change in the atmospheric and ocean chemistry.\"Banded iron formations are chemical sediments precipitated directly from ancient seawater rich in dissolved iron. Metabolic actions of microorganisms, including photosynthesis, are thought to have facilitated the precipitation of the minerals, which formed layer upon layer over time along with chert (microcrystalline silicon dioxide). The largest deposits formed as oxygen accumulated in Earth's atmosphere about 2.5 billion years ago.\"These rocks formed in the ancient oceans, and we know that those oceans were later closed up laterally by plate tectonic processes,\" Keller explained.The mantle, though solid, flows like a fluid at about the rate that fingernails grow. Tectonic plates\u2014continent-sized sections of the crust and uppermost mantle\u2014are constantly on the move, largely as a result of thermal convection currents in the mantle. Earth's tectonic processes control the life cycles of oceans.\"Just like the Pacific Ocean is being closed today\u2014it's subducting under Japan and under South America\u2014ancient ocean basins were destroyed tectonically,\" he said. \"These rocks either had to get pushed up onto continents and be preserved\u2014and we do see some preserved, that's where the ones we're looking at today come from\u2014or subducted into the mantle.\"      Because of their high iron content, banded iron formations are denser than the mantle, which made Keller wonder whether subducted chunks of the formations sank all the way down and settled in the lowest region of the mantle near the top of Earth's core. There, under immense temperature and pressure, they would have undergone profound changes as their minerals took on different structures.\"There's some very interesting work on the properties of iron oxides at those conditions,\" Keller said. \"They can become highly thermally and electrically conductive. Some of them transfer heat as easily as metals do. So it's possible that, once in the lower mantle, these rocks would turn into extremely conductive lumps like hot plates.\"Keller and his co-workers posit that regions enriched in subducted iron formations might aid the formation of mantle plumes, rising conduits of hot rock above thermal anomalies in the lower mantle that can produce enormous volcanoes like the ones that formed the Hawaiian Islands.\"Underneath Hawaii, seismological data show us a hot conduit of upwelling mantle,\" Keller said. \"Imagine a hot spot on your stove burner. As the water in your pot is boiling, you'll see more bubbles over a column of rising water in that area. Mantle plumes are sort of a giant version of that.\"\"We looked at the depositional ages of banded iron formations and the ages of large basaltic eruption events called large igneous provinces, and we found that there's a correlation,\" Keller said. \"Many of the igneous events\u2014which were so massive that the 10 or 15 largest may have been enough to resurface the entire planet\u2014were preceded by banded iron formation deposition at intervals of roughly 241 million years, give or take 15 million. It's a strong correlation with a mechanism that makes sense.\"The study showed that there was a plausible length of time for banded iron formations to first be drawn deep into the lower mantle and to then influence heat flow to drive a plume toward Earth's surface thousands of kilometers above.In his effort to trace the journey of banded iron formations, Keller crossed disciplinary boundaries and ran into unexpected insights.\"If what's happening in the early oceans, after microorganisms chemically change surface environments, ultimately creates an enormous outpouring of lava somewhere else on Earth 250 million years later, that means these processes are related and 'talking' to each other,\" Keller said. \"It also means it's possible for related processes to have length scales that are far greater than people expected. To be able to infer this, we've had to draw on data from many different fields across mineralogy, geochemistry, geophysics and sedimentology.\"Keller hopes the study will spur further research. \"I hope this motivates people in the different fields that it touches,\" he said. \"I think it would be really cool if this got people talking to each other in renewed ways about how different parts of the Earth system are connected.\"Keller is part of the CLEVER Planets: Cycles of Life-Essential Volatile Elements in Rocky Planets program, an interdisciplinary, multi-institutional group of scientists led by Rajdeep Dasgupta, Rice's W. Maurice Ewing Professor of Earth Systems Science in the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences.\"This is an extremely interdisciplinary collaboration that's looking at how volatile elements that are important for biology\u2014carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur\u2014behave in planets, at how planets acquire these elements and the role they play in potentially making planets habitable,\" Keller said.\"We're using Earth as the best example that we have, but we're trying to figure out what the presence or absence of one or some of these elements might mean for planets more generally,\" he added.

  "answer_squad": " more than 310",
  "text": "The recent death of Australian man Jason Kennison after reaching the summit of Mount Everest highlights how dangerous mountain climbing can be.          Details of what went wrong as Kennison descended from the summit have yet to be confirmed by officials.However, his death\u2014one of several this year on Mount Everest\u2014is a reminder of the challenges mountain climbers face.What is it about Mount Everest?Mount Everest\u2014also known as Chomolungma (its Tibetan name) or Sagarmatha (its Nepali name)\u2014is the highest mountain on Earth with a peak at 8,849 meters above sea-level.May 29 this year marks 70 years since the first successful summit of Mount Everest by Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary.This year's climbing season is shaping to be one of the busiest ever after the Nepali government issued a record 478 climbing permits. This year has also seen Kami Rita Sherpa complete a record 28th summit of Mount Everest.However, 2023 will end as one of the deadliest on record, with 11 deaths recorded for the season to May 23, and a further two climbers still missing.Preparing to climbTo prepare for the physical, psychological and technical challenges of a Mount Everest summit attempt, climbers typically undertake extensive preparation that can last months, and even years.They acclimatize by sleeping in altitude tents (which can simulate high-altitudes at home) and/or training in chambers that simulate low-oxygen environments. They also climb other peaks higher than 6,000m.Climbers typically stagger their ascent to base camp. Then, they complete further treks to higher altitudes (above 7,000m) around base camp, or on the Mount Everest summit route itself.However, this extensive preparation does not eliminate the risks, and climbers continue to perish each climbing season.What makes Mount Everest so deadly?According to the Himalayan Database, more than 310 people have lost their lives on Mount Everest since 1922, through to the end of the 2022 climbing season. In that time, more than 16,000 non-Sherpa climbers have attempted to summit Mount Everest and 5,633 have been successful.These successful attempts were supported by 5,825 summits by Sherpas. However, many more Sherpas have climbed the upper reaches of Mount Everest to support expedition members, without attempting to summit. Some have reached the summit more than once.From 2006 to 2019, the death rate for first-time, non-Sherpa climbers was 0.5% for women and 1.1% for men.The dangers faced by climbers pushing for the summit of Mount Everest are vast. These include the risk of avalanche, falling rocks/ice, danger when crossing the Khumbu Icefall, hypothermia from exposure to extreme cold, falls, severe fatigue and exhaustion, and illness associated with extremely low oxygen.Of all deaths from 1950 to 2019 in non-Sherpa climbers during a summit bid on Mount Everest, about 35% were caused by falls, with other leading causes being exhaustion (22%), altitude illness (18%) and exposure (13%).                Crossing the Khumbu Icefall can be particularly dangerous. Credit: Shutterstock             In Sherpa deaths over the same time period, 44% were attributable to avalanches. One 2014 avalanche took the lives of 16 Sherpas.Almost 84% of deaths in non-Sherpa climbers occurred on their descent\u2014after either successfully reaching the top of Mount Everest, or after turning back before reaching the summit.While some deaths on descent are related to falls, most are linked to extreme fatigue and exhaustion, or sustained exposure to extremely low levels of oxygen.In Sherpas, most deaths occur on the lower sections of the climb where they spend lots of time preparing the expedition route and are exposed to greater risk of trauma-related death.      Low oxygen at extreme altitudeAt Mount Everest base camp (5,364m), oxygen availability is about 50% of that at sea-level. At the summit, oxygen availability decreases to less than 30%.In these high-altitude, low-oxygen environments, climbers are at significant risk of:acute mountain sicknesshigh-altitude pulmonary oedema, andhigh-altitude cerebral oedema.Acute mountain sickness is the less severe of the three conditions and is associated with symptoms such as headache, nausea, loss of appetite, and in some cases vomiting and fatigue. Generally, it can resolve following further acclimatization and rest, or descent to lower altitudes. It rarely evolves into a life-threatening condition.However, with continued exposure to high altitude, more severe conditions can develop.High-altitude pulmonary oedema is caused by accumulation of fluid in the lungs. This leads to excessive breathlessness and a dry cough that can evolve to one that produces a foamy, pink sputum.High-altitude cerebral oedema is caused by excess fluid in the brain and leads to severe headache, confusion, dizziness, loss of balance, and ultimately coma or death, if untreated.Almost all non-Sherpa climbers on Mount Everest summit attempts climb with supplemental oxygen tanks to assist their physical performance and mitigate the risk of developing these conditions.Ultimately however, for some climbers this is not enough and even if they successfully reach the summit, they succumb to the environment or high-altitude related illness on their descent back to base camp.

  "text": "Earth's declining ice is without a doubt one of the clearest signs of climate change. A new high-resolution sea-ice concentration data record has just been released as part of ESA's Climate Change Initiative\u2014providing new insights of sea ice concentration across the globe.          In recent decades, the relentless rise in global temperatures has triggered a concerning reduction in the extent and thickness of sea ice. The Arctic region in particular has witnessed a rapid loss of sea ice, with ESA satellite observations providing alarming evidence of this trend.The impacts are profound, as it not only disrupts the lives of indigenous communities but also affects polar wildlife, global weather patterns and oceanic currents.ESA's Climate Change Initiative's Sea Ice team has now released a new data record covering 30 years (1991-2020) of sea-ice concentration in higher resolution. Although the dataset isn't as long as the 40-year records already available, it allows us to see the ice in much more detail.Thomas Lavergne, senior scientist at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and science lead for the CCI Sea Ice project, explains, \"Our team has processed the high-frequency, higher resolution imagery from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and the Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS) to obtain a clearer picture of sea ice concentration across the globe.\"\"Although the dataset is shorter, it is an advanced, sharpened version of that from Eumetsat OSI SAF and reveals more detail to improve model predictions and understanding of Arctic dynamics.\"The data is processed from microwave imagery and Numerical Weather Prediction data through a dedicated algorithm developed by the CCI Sea Ice team. The data were then validated using data from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 radar mission which provides all-weather sea-ice mapping capabilities.Dirk Notz, from the University of Hamburg, commented, \"For the climate research community, the new, high resolution sea-ice product by ESA is really exciting! All around the world, modeling groups are currently developing the next generation of climate models that aim at a grid resolution of just a few kilometers.\"To evaluate these models, and to learn how well we understand the processes that drive the ongoing sea-ice loss on these scales, having access to satellite data with a similar spatial resolution is absolutely crucial. This new product couldn't be more timely!\"These long-term datasets, compiled with data from numerous satellites, enable researchers to study the long-term trends and variations in the Arctic and Antarctic, contributing to a better understanding of the polar response to global warming and improved prediction of future change.Thomas Lavergne continues, \"We hope that this higher resolution dataset will benefit its users and will help gain new insights about the regional and local scales linking sea ice to other elements of the Earth system.\"This dataset comes a few months after the CCI Sea Ice team released a \"historical\" sea ice dataset to reveal how sea ice formed in the early 1970s.The team, using \"satellite archaeology,\" reprocessed observations from the Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer (ESMR) onboard the Nimbus-5 satellite, to derive global sea ice concentration and extent from 1972-1977, which predate sea ice climate data records from modern satellite radiometers (which started in 1979).Both the new high-resolution dataset and the early-1970s dataset can be accessed and downloaded from the Climate Change Initiative's Open Data Portal.Using information from ESA\u2019s ERS, Envisat and CryoSat satellites as well as the Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 missions, research led by Tom Slater of the University of Leeds, found that the rate at which Earth has lost ice has increased markedly within the past three decades. Currently, more than a trillion tonnes of ice is lost each year. To put this into perspective, this is equivalent to an ice cube measuring 10x10x10 km over Oslo\u2019s skyline. Putting it another way, the amount of ice loss globally is equivalent to 12 000 times the annual water use of the Norwegian capital. Credit: Planetary VisionsLooking aheadThe Special Report for a 1.5\u00b0C Global Warming documents that to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels could \"substantially\" reduce the risk of sea ice-free summers in the Arctic with respect to a 2\u00b0C warming.Although satellite observations are the foundation for most of our knowledge about the evolution of the global sea ice cover, progress is still acutely needed to improve the observations of the Sea Ice Essential Climate Variable, in particular to achieve better spatial resolution, better consistency across satellite missions and longer time series.The data collected not only enhance our knowledge of sea ice concentration, but also support decision-making processes and the development of effective mitigation and adaptation strategies.Governments, policymakers and scientific communities rely heavily on these satellite observations to assess the environmental impact, predict future scenarios, and inform policies for sustainable management of the Arctic region.The importance of the Arctic is reflected in the Copernicus program that is now evolving to implement new satellite capabilities prioritizing new Arctic measurements that are urgently needed by Copernicus Services.This includes the upcoming Copernicus Imaging multi-frequency Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) and the Copernicus Polar Ice and Snow Topography Altimeter (CRISTAL) missions that will together provide the sustained, long-term observations needed for polar climate monitoring, climate research and marine services.

  "text": "When people come together to manage collectively owned natural resources like forests, they may become more cooperative and trusting overall, according to recent research led by CU Boulder.          The study takes a new look at what has become a growing trend around the world: Since the 1990s, groups like the Yuracar\u00e9 of Bolivia and residents of the village of Mpunda in Uganda have fought for, and secured, collective property rights to the land they live on. Individuals don't own this land. Instead, the communities own and manage wide swaths of woodlands together, deciding when to harvest or plant new trees free from most outside interference.Previous studies have suggested that such agreements may be good for the environment\u2014forests, in particular, may flourish under collective property rights.The new research, however, shows that such rights can also have much broader, although more subtle, impacts on people.\"We found that communities who got collective rights to their forests were able to improve how they interact with each other during forest-related activities, like harvesting trees,\" said Komal Preet Kaur, lead author of the study and a doctoral student in political science at CU Boulder. \"We would expect that. But they were also more cooperative around non-forestry activities, such as working on community projects, which was really surprising.\"Krister Andersson, co-author of the study and professor of political science, sees the findings as a rare bit of good news in the world of conservation. Collective land rights, in many cases, line up with how Indigenous peoples have interacted with and cared for natural resources for centuries.\"Environmental activists and scholars are really bad at paying attention to good news. We always ring the alarm bells,\" Andersson said. \"But one of the really positive stories when it comes to forests is that governments are increasingly recognizing the ancestral rights of Indigenous peoples to their lands.\"Building prideThe road to that recognition, however, can be long.Take the Yuracar\u00e9. These Indigenous people live around the Chapare River of central Bolivia, a region of rich tropical forests where palm and wild cocoa trees abound. There, they harvest bananas and yucca and fish and hunt for game.In the mid-1990s, following decades of activism from Indigenous groups, the Bolivian government passed a series of bills aimed at reforming the nation's land rights. The government redistributed control of more than 65,000 square miles of land, much of it forested. Today, the Yuracar\u00e9 oversee a 954-square-mile tract of forest and farmland. They make decisions about these resources through an assembly, which includes representatives from multiple \"corregimientos,\" or coalitions of neighboring families.In the new study, Andersson and his colleagues set out to discover what kinds of impacts land reforms could have on the psychology of people like the Yuracar\u00e9.\"When you see a community that has engaged in all these struggles to get recognition, and then they are recognized by the national authorities, they present themselves in a whole different way,\" Andersson said. \"They carry themselves with more pride.\"      Forestry gamesThe team gathered information on 213 groups living in 10 countries recorded in the International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI) dataset. This resource, led by Indiana University and University of Michigan, includes data on how communities around the world manage their natural resources. Some of the communities held collective rights to forests, while others didn't.The researchers also traveled to Bolivia and Uganda where they invited local forest users to workshops where they played \"behavioral games\" to gauge their ability to solve a collective problem. Teams of eight people sat around a table stacked with wooden blocks representing trees in a shared forest. Over a series of rounds, they decided how many of these blocks to harvest. If too many of the players pursued short-term profits, the forest would disappear quickly.\"There's a tension,\" Andersson said. \"You have to decide: Do I go in and grab as many trees as I can to make a quick buck in the short term? Or do I try to cooperate with the others so that everyone wins?\"The researchers could easily spot the differences between the behavior of people who held the rights to their forests versus those who didn't: Players from groups with colletive property rights were more cooperative during the game, on average. They talked over their agreements and plans and seemed to trust each other more.Drawing on the IFRI dataset, the researchers also discovered that communities with collective land rights scored higher on several measurements of cooperation. They tended to collaborate more on community projects, such as maintaining roads or digging wells. In all, those communities were about 10% more cooperative when it came to non-forestry activities than groups without collective land rights.For Kaur, the study shows that such collective property rights may be a good approach not just for protecting forests\u2014but also for helping knit people together.\"Indigenous communities and local people who have been using these resources for generations have been disrupted because of colonialism,\" she said. \"It's time the governments give their due rights back.\" More information:Komal Preet Kaur et al, Collective forest land rights facilitate cooperative behavior, Conservation Letters (2023).

  "text": "When the dust that wafts off the Sahel and Sahara regions of Africa mixes with tropical clouds, it creates what's known as a rainy \"disturbance\" in the eastern Atlantic. These disturbances are hurricanes in their youngest form, and as they travel across the ocean, they can either dissipate or grow into powerful storms.          To study these infant storms, a group of NASA scientists in September 2022 spent a month flying off the northwestern coast of Africa aboard NASA's DC-8 research plane. Each day, the team took off from Cabo Verde, an island nation off the west coast of Africa, logging roughly 100 hours altogether. The mission, known as the Convective Processes Experiment\u2014Cabo Verde (CPEX-CV) released its data publicly on April 1.The CPEX-CV team operated September 1\u201330, 2022. Using state-of-the-art remote-sensing lidars, radars, radiometers, and dropsondes\u201411-inch, lightweight tubes equipped with a parachute that is dropped from the plane to measure wind, temperature, and humidity\u2014scientists captured and logged data for each flight. This month, the instrument teams have submitted data to their respective NASA data archive centers, the NASA Atmospheric Science Data Center and the Global Hydrometeorology Resource Center.\"Combined with the global picture that satellites provide, this data offers finer details that only an airplane outfitted with instrumentation can measure,\" said Will McCarty, CPEX program scientist based at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC.These observations provide a window into how dust, moisture, clouds, and the ocean interact to either build or prevent intensification of the rainy disturbances that have the potential to become hurricanes. This data, which is open and available to the public, will benefit researchers and weather forecasters, especially those in the atmospheric science community, according to Amin Nehrir, a research scientist based at NASA's Langley Research Center, in Virginia.                On September 22, 2022, the CPEX campaign encountered and measured one of the largest dust events that NASA has ever sampled. While the DC-8 Airborne Laboratory captured data with its instruments, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) affixed to the Suomi NPP spacecraft captured the event from space as pictured above. Credit: NASA             \"This can be considered discovery data,\" Nehrir said. \"It will inevitably help answer questions in years to come that haven't been asked yet.\"As the plane flew, sensors on the wingtips of the aircraft measured properties of the dust and clouds. Once the plane was above the clouds, onboard remote sensing instruments captured detailed profiles of Saharan dust, wind speed and direction, temperature, moisture, and the structure of convection and rain within clouds. Together these measurements provide an overall, multidimensional view of what's in the air over the northeast Atlantic, shedding light onto how those variables influence weather systems in their infancy stage.      Multiple times in the campaign the DC-8 soared through the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the region where the northeast and southeast trade winds come together. The ITCZ is known by sailors as \"the calms\" because of its windless weather. Some of the most remote oceans of the world make up the ITCZ, Nehrir said.\"What was most striking to me was being able to look out the window and see how the clouds changed as far as the eye could see from the faint, puffy clouds to cloud streets to convective systems,\" he said. \"You get to see the progression of convective systems all in one shot.\"On September 22, 2022, the CPEX campaign encountered and measured one of the largest dust events that NASA has ever sampled.

Data from the previous campaigns is also available to the public.\"Nine science projects and 10 instrument and support teams were funded under this campaign, so those investigators helped plan the mission, and now they will take that data back to their home institutions to learn what they can,\" McCarty said. \"Now it's off to the races.\" Provided byNASACitation:In dust and clouds over Africa, scientists find clues to how hurricanes form (2023, May 25)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-clouds-africa-scientists-clues-hurricanes.html  This document is subject to copyright.

We have created maps that help identify the changing risk to land, property, and infrastructure from rising seas, at a regional and national scale.\"We hope this information will raise awareness and help councils and government to know where to conduct detailed investigations when developing adaptation strategies to protect our coastal communities,\" said Dr. Stephens.The maps are also intended to help the financial industry, national infrastructure, and service providers to risk assess their portfolios.\"It's difficult to make decisions about the future if you can't see it\u2014these maps provide a window into the future,\" said Dr. Stephens.Coastal flooding is particularly likely when high tides, storm surges and large waves occur simultaneously. At these times, low-lying areas are inundated when high seas overtop or even break barriers, and cause rivers to back up inland.This can destroy property, infrastructure, and be a danger to life, as well as having severe impacts on the natural environment and ecosystems.\"With much of our major infrastructure and roughly 65% of New Zealanders living within 5km of the coast, this is an issue that will impact many of us, so we must be aware of what's coming and be prepared to adapt.\"\"These maps are not designed for assessing exposure to individual properties, however. Many councils have more detailed maps for that purpose. The advantage is that they fill in gaps for areas of the country that don't currently have this data available, they provide nationwide information, and they include many scenarios of sea-level rise,\" said Dr. Stephens.The maps were used in new research that examined New Zealand's increasing exposure to coastal flooding with sea-level rise.The research found that small amounts of sea-level rise will drive a rapid increase in cumulative flooding from increasingly frequent coastal-flood events-nationally, and 30% more land area would be regularly flooded after 0.3m relative sea-level rise.\"By 2065, there could be 0.4m of sea-level rise, based on the current trajectory, or sooner where the landmass is subsiding,\" said Dr. Stephens.The maps can be viewed, and data downloaded at https://niwa.co.nz/natural-hazards/our-services/extreme-coastal-flood-maps-for-aotearoa-new-zealand.

  "text": "Diplomats from 175 countries gathering in Paris for plastics treaty talks on Monday may want to pack an umbrella, but not just because there's a chance of rain.          France's capital will also be showered during the five-day talks by billions of microplastic particles falling from the sky, according to the first-ever plastics pollution weather forecast.The predicted downpour will range between 40 and 48 kilograms (88 and 106 pounds) of free-floating plastic bits blanketing greater Paris every 24 hours, the scientists involved told AFP.If the weather delivers heavy rain, the \"plastic fall\" is likely to increase up to tenfold.\"This should sharpen the focus of negotiators,\" said Marcus Gover, head of plastics research at the Minderoo Foundation based in Perth, Australia.\"Plastic particles break down into the environment and this toxic cocktail ends up in our bodies, where it does unimaginable damage to our health.\"Concern over the impact of plastics on the environment and human well-being has surged in recent years along with a crescendo of research documenting its omnipresence and persistence.In nature, multi-colored microplastics\u2014by definition less than five millimeters (0.2 inches) in diameter\u2014have been found in ice near the North Pole and inside fish navigating the oceans' deepest, darkest recesses.Plastic debris is estimated to kill more than a million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals each year, according to the United Nations Environment Programme, and filter-feeding blue whales consume up to 10 million pieces of microplastic every day.                Plastic pieces in frozen water near Vaasa, Finland.             'Heads in the sand'The equivalent of a garbage truck's worth of plastic refuse is dumped into the ocean every minute.In humans, microscopic bits of plastic have been detected in blood, breast milk and placentas.Animal tests have linked chemicals in microplastics to increased risks of cancer, reproductive problems and DNA mutations but data on human impact is still lacking.\"In our bodies, the plastics we need to be most worried about are probably those between 10 nanometers and one micrometer,\" said pediatrician Christos Symeonides, a researcher at Murdoch Children's Research Hospital and the Minderoo Foundation.\"They're the ones most likely to get through our biological membranes into tissues, including the blood-brain barrier,\" he told AFP.\"We're just now pulling our heads out of the sand when it comes to the health hazards of microplastics.\"The forecast for Paris next week only covers significantly larger particles, mostly synthetic fibers at least 50 microns in length.For reference, a human hair is about 80 microns (or 80,000 nanometers) across.The method developed by Minderoo Foundation researchers does not measure plastic falling through the atmosphere in real time.Rather, it is based on research done in Paris starting in 2015 that collected samples from multiple locations year round and sifted through them in the laboratory.                Sources of microplastics in the world's oceans.             'Virgin' plasticThis pioneering work by French scientists found that most plastic particles falling across Paris' 2,500-square-kilometer (965-square-mile) catchment area were nylon and polyester, probably from clothing.Other bits were cast off by tires, which shed them especially when vehicles brake.Over an entire year up to 10 metric tons of microplastic fibers settle over the Paris area, they estimated.The density of \"plastic fall\" can increase by an order of magnitude during heavy rain.Measurements taken by other teams have replicated these findings in half a dozen cities around the world.Microplastics that hit the ground can still be ingested or inhaled when stirred up, for example, on a windy day.Last year, 175 nations agreed to forge a legally binding treaty to curb plastic pollution, aiming to complete negotiations by 2024.No major breakthroughs are expected at the technical talks starting on Monday, but major policy debated will include a global ban on single-use plastic items, a \"polluter pays\" scheme and a tax on new or \"virgin\" plastic production.These policies\u2014even if fully implemented\u2014may not be enough to cut consumption, according to experts and green groups calling for an outright cap on plastic production.On current trends, annual production of fossil-fuel-based plastics will nearly triple by 2060 to 1.2 billion tons, while waste will exceed one billion tons, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:And now the weather: Cloudy with scattered showers of plastic (2023, May 25)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-weather-cloudy-showers-plastic.html  This document is subject to copyright.

Like others living in the shadow of Popocatepetl, located just 70 kilometers (about 45 miles) southeast of Mexico City, he is used to its periodic tantrums.\"We keep on working, just waiting to see what the volcano does,\" Atenco told AFP in his restaurant, in the ash-covered community of San Nicolas de los Ranchos, in the foothills of rumbling \"El Popo.\"\"We have to clean up. We have to work, and everything's dirty,\" he added, after sweeping the ash from the sidewalk in front of his business again.Since Friday, \"Don Goyo\" as the volcano is also known locally, has rattled nerves with several explosions and repeated emissions of ash, gasses and molten rock.The increased activity caused dozens of flights to be canceled over the weekend out of Mexico City.Shelters have been opened near Popocatepetl in case the situation escalates, while troops have been deployed and are helping to sweep up ash in the streets.Roughly 25 million people live within a 100-kilometer radius of Popocatepetl, the second-tallest volcano in Mexico, rising nearly 5,500 meters (18,000 feet) above sea level.On Sunday, authorities increased their warning level to one step below red alert, which, if reached, would mean evacuation for thousands like Atenco living near the volcano, whose name means \"smoking mountain\" in the indigenous Nahuatl language.                A man sweeps ash from a roof in a town near Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano.             'Capricious activity'Although the volcano's explosions send chills down the spines of locals, the latest burst of activity is not very different than others seen since it awoke from decades of slumber in 1994, according to expert Juan Manuel Espindola.Popocatepetl saw similar episodes in the late 1990s and early 2000s, although the current phase could potentially \"go in a more dangerous direction,\" said the National Autonomous University of Mexico researcher.In 1997, intense activity blanketed parts of Mexico City in thick layers of ash, which can cause respiratory illness and clog drains.Experts are constantly monitoring seismic activity around the volcano, as well as the composition of the materials and gasses it spews out, to try to predict a possible major eruption.\"Volcanoes have a somewhat capricious activity,\" Espindola said.                Popocatepetl is located just 70 kilometres (about 45 miles) from Mexico City.             President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador sought to calm public concerns on Wednesday, urging people \"not to be alarmed.\"\"It seems that 'Don Goyo' is calming down, although it's still emitting ash,\" he said.Authorities have warned people not to go within 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) of Popocatepetl, and to use face masks due to the falling ash.                Soldiers have been deployed in case evacuations are needed -- and to help clean up falling ash in the meantime.             Some residents living near Popocatepetl left over the weekend after volcanic activity caused their houses to vibrate, according to Raymundo Mena, a local church volunteer.After a lifetime living in the foothills of the volcano, he tries to remain calm, despite the fact that in recent days \"even the roofs were shaking.\"\"We're not going to be scared,\" he said.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Shaking roofs, frayed nerves as Mexico's 'Popo' volcano rumbles (2023, May 25)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-roofs-frayed-nerves-mexico-popo.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Energy security concerns\u2014worsened by the war in Ukraine\u2014and policy support from rich countries are likely to help investments in clean energy outpace spending on fossil fuels, the International Energy Agency said in a report issued Thursday.          But investments in coal are on course to rise by about 10% in 2023, nearly six times what the IEA has estimated they should be for the world to end its reliance on fossil fuels and achieve emissions cut goals for countering climate change, it said.\"We are in a significantly better place than we were a few years ago,\" Tim Gould, IEA's chief energy economist, said at the report's launch Thursday. \"There's still a very long way to go, but there are finally some encouraging signs for us all to welcome.\"Some $2.8 trillion is set to be invested in energy globally in 2023, of which more than $1.7 trillion is expected to go to clean technologies including modern electricity grids, energy storage, low-emissions fuels and electric vehicles, according to the organization's latest World Energy Investment report.Slightly more than $1 trillion is going to coal, gas and oil\u2014fossil fuels that are a major source of emissions that are contributing to global warming.Part of the problem is that demand for energy is outstripping increases in supplies in many parts of the world. Powerful energy industry interests also sway decisions about investments in future capacity, often in favor of fossil fuels.                Smoking chimneys are seen along a highway in a coal producing region in Yulin in northwestern China's Shaanxi province, April 24, 2023. Energy security concerns, worsened by the war in Ukraine, and policy support from rich countries are likely to help investments in clean energy outpace spending on fossil fuels, the International Energy Agency said in a report issued Thursday, May 25, 2023. Credit: AP Photo/Ng Han Guan             Global coal demand reached an all-time high in 2022 and about 40 gigawatts of new coal power plants were approved, the highest figure since 2016, with almost all in China, the report says.Still, the trend is shifting in favor of renewable energy. For every $1 spent on fossil fuels, $1.70 is now spent on clean energy. Five years ago the ratio was 1:1, according to the report.Clean energy investments have been boosted by a variety of factors in recent years, including periods of strong economic growth and volatile fossil fuel prices that raised concerns about energy security, especially following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Enhanced policy support such as the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. and initiatives in Europe, Japan, China and elsewhere have also played a role.\"Solar is the star performer and more than $1 billion per day is expected to go into solar investments in 2023 (USD 380 billion for the year as a whole), edging this spending above that in upstream oil for the first time,\" the report said, referring to crude oil output.

Credit: AP Photo/Ng Han Guan             Electric vehicle sales are expected to leap by a third in 2023 after surging in 2022, it said.More than 90% of the increase in clean energy investments comes from advanced economies and China, with much less in less wealthy nations. Factors such as high interest rates, weak electricity grid infrastructure and unclear policies are holding back investments in renewable energy in many countries, the report said.Vibhuti Garg, the South Asia director for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said that the focus for rich countries is on investing in their own economies and not on making that capital available for poorer nations.Since 2009, rich nations have promised to spend $100 billion in climate aid for poor nations, with most of it aimed at helping wean them away off fossil fuels like coal and to build clean energy systems. But these financial pledges haven't been fulfilled. Garg said that this means that developing countries will continue to rely on dirty coal.\"How do you expect these developing countries to transition when they don't have money?\" she said.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

  "text": "\"We're scared, but where can we go?\" said Christine Nzigire, in her rickety wooden house perched precariously on a hillside.          She once had tenants, but they left in a panic after a mudslide ripped through the neighborhood in March.\"When it rains too hard, we take shelter with our neighbors,\" Nzigire, 37, explained.To the outside world, Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province in eastern Democratic Republic, presents a picturesque image.Clapboard houses pack the hills that overlook Lake Kivu, one Africa's Great Lakes.But the city's genial appearance belies a growing risk, for the poor, of being swept away.Bukavu's chronic fear of landslides rose a further notch this month when over 400 people were killed in Kalehe, just to the north.Nzigire's neighbor Isabelle Zaninga, 38, was luckier than most\u2014her house stands on relatively solid ground.Families took refuge inside her home during the most recent downpours, she told AFP.Zaninga, like many other residents of Bukavu's Nyakaliba neighborhood, fled to the city to escape conflict that has plagued eastern Congo for decades\u2014a legacy of regional wars that flared in the 1990s and 2000s.                A city of around two million people, Bukavu extends from hillsides overlooking Lake Kivu to a peninsula that juts into the lake itself.             With little if any money, and practically no support, displaced people sought out the cheapest parts of the city and built on tiny plots of land.Homes were often raised on slopes, without proper foundations or drainage that would channel rainwater safely away.Graveyard livingOver the past 20 years, a new neighborhood has even sprung up inside Bukavu's largest cemetery, by the Ruzizi river, which marks the border with neighboring Rwanda.Eric Zaluke, a father of two, lives in a small corrugated-iron shack abutting a tomb.\"No problem, we live in peace,\" Zaluke said.Nearby, beans and manioc, also called cassava, grew between the graves.Founded at the beginning of the 20th century by Belgian settlers, Bukavu was originally designed for 100,000 people, according to local civil-society figure Elvis Mupenda.                A man walks his goat in Bukavu's largest cemetery. Many poor people have built their homes there for lack of space elsewhere.             Today, the population is believed to be two million, although precise figures are hard to come by.Jean de Dieu Cikonza Maroyi, 54, a communications officer in the provincial urban planning department, described the Bukavu of his childhood as a \"fragrant\" city of tree-lined avenues.\"It was a good place to live,\" he said.Now, he said bluntly, the city was a \"slum.\" Trees are a rarity and traffic clogs the major arteries.Ladislas Witanene, a green activist, said that petty corruption had allowed people to circumvent building codes.\"We're building in drainage channels, on river banks,\" he said. \"We're even pushing back the lake water to build\" on reclaimed lake bed, he added.\"Imagine what will happen when water reclaims these spaces,\" added Witanene, noting that the city was studying options for relocating people to safer sites.Climate change is also raising the risk of disaster, he explained: \"Even in the dry season we can have torrential rains.\"                South Kivu province lies in eastern DR Congo -- a region that has been troubled by violence since the 1990s.             DilemmaBut hopes of moving people out of the hillside slums run into two hurdles.Any relocation plan will come to naught if the shops and offices of central Bukavu\u2014the economic magnet that has lured the people to the city\u2014do not also move.And money, too, is a perennial problem.Faustin Buroko, the administrator of the Nyakaliba district, explained that 62 people there had been given new plots of land, but \"most are not leaving because they cannot afford to rebuild\" their homes.In this district of 65,000 souls, the authorities recorded 270 fires or landslides between January and May alone, he said.Robert Banywesize, a 45-year-old civil servant, pointed to a collapsed retaining wall that was holding back the earth by his house. His living-room floor had also caved in.\"This season it's rained a lot. There are no more trees to support the earth,\" he said, adding that there were also frequent earthquakes in the volcanic region.                    Shops and houses are often built on slopes without proper foundations or drainage.                                     Fragile home: Sarah, 24, and her 16-month-old child.                 \"We were told to leave but without compensation, what can we do?\" Banywesize asked.Farther down the road stood a one-storey wooden house leaning dangerously forward.Spooked by fears of imminent collapse, the owner had left. But he was replaced by his brother Justin, 32, and wife Sarah, 24, as well as their 16-month-old child.\"We don't have anywhere else to go,\" said Sarah, as Justin attempted to lighten the weight of the house by breaking up the concrete flooring with a hammer.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:On the edge: DR Congo city stalked by fear of landslides (2023, May 25)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-edge-dr-congo-city-stalked.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Negotiations on a global treaty to combat plastic pollution will resume Monday, with nations under pressure to stem the tide of trash amid calls from campaigners to limit industry influence on the talks.          Some 175 nations pledged last year to agree by 2024 a binding deal to end the pollution from largely fossil fuel-based plastics that is choking the environment and infiltrating the bodies of humans and animals.The May 29-June 2 talks in Paris are tasked with agreeing the first outline for actions that could form the basis of a draft negotiating text.A global ban on single-use plastic items and \"polluter pays\" schemes are among the measures under discussion.Last month wealthy G7 nations\u2014United States, Japan, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy and Canada\u2014committed to zero plastic pollution by 2040.They said it was an attainable goal thanks to the rise of the circular economy and the possibility of reducing or banning single-use plastics and non-recyclables.Campaigners are pushing for the talks to go further and focus on cutting the amount of plastic that gets made in the first place.Plastic production has doubled in 20 years. It wraps food, is woven into clothes and the fabric of buildings, and is an important material for disposable medical products.In 2019, a total of 460 million tonnes (Mt) of the stuff was made, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which predicted production could triple again by 2060 without action.                Millions tonnes of waste is dumped in the environment or improperly burned, polluting the air.             'Once-in-a-generation'Around two-thirds of plastic waste is discarded after being used only once or a few times, and less than 10 percent is recycled.Millions of tonnes of plastic waste are dumped in the environment or improperly burned, polluting the air. Over time, it breaks down into tiny fragments that have been found everywhere from mountain tops and the deepest sea trenches, to inside human blood streams and placentas.In a report published in mid-May, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) called for systemic change to wean societies off throwaway consumerism by significantly scaling up reuse and recycling, while promoting alternative materials.It said this would help slash annual plastic pollution 80 percent by 2040 overall and cut single-use plastic production by half.But campaigners want a greater focus on slashing production.The treaty is a \"once-in-a-generation opportunity to solve the plastics crisis\", said Louise Edge, Global Plastics Campaigner for Greenpeace UK, in an open letter this week raising concerns about industry influence in the negotiations.\"Whether it succeeds or fails depends on whether governments are bold enough to ensure that the treaty delivers what the science says is needed\u2014a cap and phase down of plastic production.\"                Plastic waste exceeded 350 million tonnes in 2019, with less than 10 percent of it recycled, the OECD has said.             AmbitionsReduction of plastic use and production is at the top of a plan devised by a \"High Ambition\" coalition of 53 countries, led by Rwanda and Norway and including the European Union, Canada and Mexico.Other nations are pushing instead for a reliance on recycling, innovation and better waste management.As in the UN negotiations on climate and biodiversity, financing is a key point of tension.Rich economies have historically polluted more\u2014and for years exported trash for recycling to poorer nations, where it often winds up in the environment.Some developing nations are concerned about rules that might place too great a burden on their economies.The binding nature of the treaty is also still in question.The United States, for example, wants to limit the legal scope of the agreement, leaving signatories free to develop solutions in national plans, said a spokesperson from the French foreign office.Celebrities such as Jane Fonda and Joaquin Phoenix joined Greenpeace U.S. in mid-May to call on US President Joe Biden to raise his ambitions.                Graphic showing two scenarios of modelled short-lived plastic flows.             Fossil fuelsThe Paris talks follow an opening round of technical discussions in November in Uruguay and mark the second of five stages of negotiations expected to lead to a historic agreement covering the entire life cycle of plastics.Host country France plans a political summit on Saturday, with some 40 environment ministers and diplomats, to present recommendations by the EU \u2014one of the world's main consumers of plastic.Meanwhile, activists have raised fears over the involvement in the process of the plastics industry, even as many professional and scientific observers are unable to attend due to a lack of space.Around 175 campaign groups signed a Greenpeace letter to UNEP this week to express concern over \"the role that the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries and their lobbyists are having on the negotiations\".A spokesperson from the treaty secretariat told AFP that the original UN resolution on the negotiations decided that they \"are open for participation of all relevant stakeholders\".They added that a full list of attendees would be provided only after Monday's meeting.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:High-stakes talks to end plastic pollution resume (2023, May 25)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-high-stakes-plastic-pollution-resume.html  This document is subject to copyright.

Governor Lou Leon Guerrero was set to venture out when conditions allow to see what damage has been wrought on the island, a key US military outpost and home to 170,000 people.The governor and civil defense groups will look for \"any major damages or blocked roadways in the wake of Typhoon Mawar,\" a statement said Thursday.\"As Guam received the full brunt of the typhoon overnight, the assessment will help determine what damages may have occurred.\"Mawar brought winds of up to 225 kilometers (140 miles) an hour, the US National Weather Service reported, generating waves nine meters (30 feet) high.There were no reported deaths or injuries.At one of the island's many hotels, the 30-floor Dusit Thani Guam Resort housing about 300 guests, desk clerk Casey Hattori said the lobby was inundated with a foot of water, even with the front door barricaded with boards and bags of concrete. Outside, trees snapped in howling wind.\"I can hear the walls shaking. The wind is super strong.

  "text": "Built some 1,700 years ago by the pre-Hispanic Nazca people of Peru, an ingenious aqueduct system of wood and stone still provides farmers with water to this day.       The complex labyrinth of channels and pits up to 15 meters (49 feet) deep brings critical drinking and irrigation water from faraway mountains and rivers to about 900 subsistence farming families in the Nazca desert in southern Peru.In an otherwise arid landscape, they grow potatoes, cotton, vegetables and fruit trees.\"It helps us to irrigate,\" said farmer Nicolas Quispe, 39, who waters his potatoes from the Nazca aqueduct system \"thanks to the ancient farmers who had this advanced technology.\"Families like his pay a yearly fee equivalent to about $32 for the supply.Often hailed as a marvel of ancient hydraulic engineering, the aqueducts have been submitted by Peru to UNESCO for listing as a cultural heritage.                The system was built some 1,700 years ago.             According to the UN body, until the aqueducts were built, the shortage of water in the Peruvian desert hindered human settlement in an area where rivers are dry for most of the year.\"The inhabitants of the Nasca culture managed to use the water from the underground water table through a technological innovation, formed by underground aqueducts that operated through a system of filtering galleries,\" the UNESCO website explains.\"It is a simple system apparently, but at the same time it is sophisticated.\"The system can transport some of 18 to 20 liters of water per second, according to Peruvian authorities.The aqueducts, 42 in total, are believed to have been built by the same people responsible for Peru's famous Nazca lines\u2014a series of geometric and animal figures carved into the desert which can only be appreciated from the sky.

  "text": "They come from factory stacks, car exhaust pipes and cruise liner engines. They are tiny particles and they are all around us. When we breathe in air, these particles settle in the small vessels of our lungs, and they make us sick.          For many years now, we have known that air pollution is bad for our health. For example, American researchers have found that you have a 20% higher risk of dying prematurely if you live next to a big road.In recent years, many countries\u2014especially Western countries\u2014have spent time and efforts to come up with solutions to reduce air pollution. Particle filters and phasing out use of the most polluting energy sources have helped. In Denmark, emissions of fine particles have been reduced by 48% since 1990.But despite this progress, even more people will die prematurely from particulate air pollution in the future according to model calculations performed by Ulas Im, Department of Environmental Science at Aarhus University, in collaboration with NASA.The study is published in the journal Environmental Research.Together, Im and NASA have developed a global model for air pollution that includes climate change, particle emission reduction measures and changes in population composition. The model depicts a bleak future, especially for the countries in Asia.\"Even if they reduce air pollution significantly in Asia, the mortality rate will still be high. This is because their populations are aging. And you become more vulnerable to pollution with age,\" Ulas Im says.Extremely complicated calculationsUlas Im from Aarhus University and NASA have come together in this project because both institutions have unique technology that\u2014if combined\u2014offer entirely new possibilities and perspectives.The NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York has one of the most advanced climate models in the world, and Aarhus University has one of the best computer models for how air pollution affects human health.By creating a hybrid of the two models and running the new model through Aarhus University's supercomputer, Ulas Im and his partners from NASA could create three scenarios for how air pollution will affect human health in the future.\"We fed the model with three different scenarios: one in which most of the world continues to regulate and try to limit air pollution; one in which we do even more than we do today; and finally, one in which we do less,\" he says.But even in the most optimistic of the three scenarios, the result turned out to be bleak, especially for Asia.\"Although China has done much to reduce air pollution in recent decades, air pollution will have a dire impact in the future. Even if they step up their efforts. This is because of their aging population. A greater share of the population will simply be more vulnerable,\" he says.                This map predicts how the air pollution with fine particles will be in the future - according to Ulas Im's computer simulation. The blue colored areas show where the pollution are worst. Green is a little better and yellow means almost no pollution. Credit: Journal for Environmental Research Fine particles and hazardous chemical compoundsThe particles that Ulas Im and NASA include in their model are among the most harmful anthropogenic pollutants. However, the model does not include all forms of air pollution, he emphasizes.\"We have studied the effect of fine particles, which are also referred to as PM2.5, and the effect of ozone, which is formed in the atmosphere when NOx gases and other molecules that we humans emit, react with the air,\" he says.Both fine particles and ozone are harmful to our lungs.The fine particles penetrate deep into the lungs and end up in the alveoli, in the tiniest air spaces of the lungs, where they settle and do damage because they make it more difficult to breathe. The consequences of this can be severe. Some people may develop asthma, others blood clots, hardening of the arteries, or even cancer.Ozone has the same effect. The tiny gas molecules can cause damage to the lungs, which can cause chest pain and breathing difficulties.The damage has already been doneIn the most optimistic of Ulas Im's scenarios, we manage to do a lot more to reduce air pollution at global level. But the scenario still predicts an annual death rate of four million people.\"Because of an aging population in Asia, it's difficult to prevent these deaths. Even if they were to do everything they could, they would still not be able to prevent the high death rate,\" he says.This is because air pollution is a slow killer. The seeds of future illness and death have already been planted in many people. In other words, the damage has already been done. Therefore, the numbers will not be reduced, even if we cut our emissions of harmful particles drastically.\"Even if we electrify our cars, replace coal-powered and gas-powered power plants with wind turbines and solar PV, and cut down on aviation, we won't be able to rectify the damage already done to our lungs,\" he says. \"But having said that, the particles disappear from the air quickly when we limit our emissions. It's not like with carbon dioxide, which stays in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.\"Air pollution in the countryside as wellCities are responsible for a substantial share of air pollution. This is where there are most cars, factories and power plants; and this is where aircraft land and cruise liners dock. But this does not necessarily mean that the air is clean once you get to the countryside.\"There are more fine particles in the air in the cities. But there is less ozone. In the countryside, it's the other way around. Here, there are fewer fine particles and more ozone. This is because, in the cities, ozone decomposes because of emissions from factories, while it thrives in the countryside,\" says Ulas Im.So, we are affected by air pollution both in the countryside and in cities. Even if the air feels nice and clean, it may be filled with ozone, which is also harmful to our lungs.\"So it's false to think that rural areas are free of air pollution, although it's still healthier to live in the countryside,\" he says. \"We hope that our calculations will lead to politicians around the world taking the problem even more seriously. We hope that they will use the figures to make decisions about limiting air pollution even further; both in the countryside and in the cities.\" More information:Ulas Im et al, Present-day and future PM2.5 and O3-related global and regional premature mortality in the EVAv6.0 health impact assessment model, Environmental Research (2022).

  "answer_race": " To introduce a new research perspective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the key to a synergistic approach?",
  "answer_squad": " understanding that carbon dioxide and air pollutants predominantly originate from the same sources",
  "text": "In a new research perspective published in Environmental Science and Ecotechnology, a research team emphasizes that the key to a synergistic approach lies in understanding that carbon dioxide and air pollutants predominantly originate from the same sources, namely, the combustion and use of fossil fuels.          Therefore, policies designed to mitigate climate change and control air pollution can generate considerable synergies. In particular, as China has committed to peaking its CO2 emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, the team believes that these goals can serve as powerful drivers for future air quality improvement.To facilitate the tracking and analysis of the synergistic governance of air pollution and climate change, the researchers developed a suite of 18 indicators. These indicators span five critical areas: air pollution and associated weather-climate conditions; progress in structural transition; sources, sinks, and mitigation pathway of atmospheric composition; health impacts and benefits of coordinated control; and synergistic governance system and practices.One of the key insights from the research perspective is the recognition of the intricate links between climate change and air pollution. Changes in meteorological factors induced by climate change can significantly impact the formation, accumulation, and dispersion of air pollution. Simultaneously, these changes can affect emissions from natural sources like vegetation, dust, and wildfires, which significantly contribute to air pollution.                The circle and triangle markers represent CO2 emissions and the population-weighted PM2.5 concentration, respectively. Figure adopted and revised from Cheng et al., 2021. Credit: The authors             In terms of public health, both climate change and air pollution pose substantial risks. Increased frequency of extreme weather events, higher risk of infectious diseases, and exposure to air pollutants can all lead to increased mortality and morbidity. Recognizing this, the researchers argue that public health protection should serve as the starting point for coordinated governance.The researchers further underline the importance of aligning the control measures for greenhouse gases and air pollutants, given their shared sources and processes. Strategies that target the reduction of fossil fuel consumption and carbon emissions will inherently mitigate air pollutant emissions, offering synergistic benefits for air quality improvement. However, the team also cautions that future carbon sink changes should be factored into planning carbon reduction pathways to avoid compromising air quality.      The research perspective also identifies considerable health and economic benefits that can arise from a synergistic approach to addressing climate change and air pollution. These include reducing the incidence of extreme weather events, saving pollution control costs, improving the structure of the economy, promoting new industries, and creating jobs.In terms of governance, the researchers advocate for a system that coordinates climate change mitigation and air pollution control, integrating strategic planning, laws, regulations, standards, and economic policies. They recommend piloting this approach in select cities and industries to gain practical experience before a broader implementation.The research team's ultimate goal is to establish a theoretical framework for the synergetic governance of carbon neutrality and clean air, identify potential challenges in developing a synergetic roadmap for China, and provide corresponding policy recommendations. This comprehensive, synergistic approach could be a game-changer in China's ongoing battles against air pollution and climate change.

  "answer_squad": " Popocatepetl",
  "text": "Towering a couple of hours from one of the world's largest cities, the Popocatepetl volcano has been coating nearby towns with ash and disrupting flights at Mexico City's airport, the busiest in Latin America.          Hundreds of explosions have spit lava from the snow-tipped peak of the 17,797-foot Popocatepetl (puh-puh-ka-TEH-pet-tl). Approximately 25 million people live within 60 miles of the mountain. Volcanologists say that, while a massive eruption doesn't appear imminent, eruptions are likely to continue, as they have for three decades.WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE POPOCATEPETL VOLCANO?There has been a surge of activity since 1994 at the volcano affectionately known as \"Popo,\" which is being tracked by scientists at Mexico's National Autonomous University (UNAM).It has had periods of intense activity between 2000 and 2003, and again between 2012 and 2016. In 2000, that activity triggered a red alert and evacuations before the volcano calmed down again.In past weeks, the volcano entered another one of those periods. Spewing ash, gas and lava, authorities have increased the alert to the yellow, second level on a stoplight-style scale, but not yet to red.Previous surges in activity date back centuries. Pre-Hispanic writings speak of intense activity at Popocatepetl at the beginning of the 16th century.In Guatemala, the Volcano of Fire claimed the lives of hundreds of people in a 2018 eruption. It has recently prompted evacuations for heightened activity as well.                Women stand on an ash-covered street from the Popocatepetl volcano in Santiago Xalitzintla, Mexico, Monday, May 22, 2023. The volcano\u00b4s activity has increased over the past week. Evacuations have not been ordered, but authorities are preparing for that scenario and telling people to stay out of 7.5-mile (12-kilometer) radius around the peak. Credit: AP Photo/Marco Ugarte             IS A MAJOR ERUPTION IMMINENT?Scientists and Mexican authorities say there's no sign that the current waves of small eruptions at Popocatepetl will turn into anything more destructive, said Servando de la Cruz Reyna, a senior geophysics researcher at the UNAM in Mexico City, adding that is there \"nothing new or surprising\" about recent movements.\"The probability that this continues as it has previously is far higher than the probability that this grows to much higher levels,\" he said.Popocatepetl has been active for a half-million years. Its last major eruption happened more than a thousand years ago.WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT DOING?Authorities have closed schools in dozens of municipalities across three states, put troops on alert, prepared shelters and checked evacuation routes. Other than that, they are encouraging people to remain calm.On Monday, Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said in his morning briefing that \"the movements of the volcano are being monitored 24 hours a day.\"                Esteban De Olarte Agustin stands next to his vehicle fouled with ash from the Popocatepetl volcano that is blanketing the streets in Santiago Xalitzintla, Mexico, Monday, May 22, 2023.

Credit: AP Photo/Marco Ugarte             WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN?Popocatepetl's recent activity is not necessarily a bad thing, said Robin Campion, a volcanologist at the Institute of Geophysics. The scientist explained that small explosions alleviate pressure from magma inside the mountain, and likely mean that it won't lead to a buildup and larger eruption.\"The good thing is that \u2026 it's constantly releasing energy,\" Campion said. \"Hopefully, it'll continue being as constant and moderate as it is, so it doesn't all erupt at once, like it did in prehistoric times.\"As it continues puffing, ash could eventually become a problem in surrounding areas, particularly in the 7.5 miles surrounding the volcano, but also in Mexico City.While the ash is not toxic, Carlos Vald\u00e9s, head of UNAM's National Seismological Service, said it could affect breathing and air quality, and also continue to affect flights to and from Mexico City's international airport.

  "text": "Fibers lost during the wear and care of textiles may pose a risk to the environment and human health when released into air and water. A study published in PLOS ONE by Neil J. Lant at Procter & Gamble, Newcastle Innovation Center, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, and colleagues suggests that while condenser dryers may reduce airborne microfibers compared to vented dryers, they are a significant contributor of waterborne microfiber pollution.          Recent studies have suggested that transitioning from vented tumble dryers to condenser dryers with no exhaust outlet could reduce airborne microfiber pollution. However, their impact on waterborne microfiber pollution is unknown. To evaluate the environmental impact of condenser dryers, researchers tested loads of new, clean garments as well as dirty laundry sourced from volunteers in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom. They collected and analyzed microfibers from several components of each type of dryer.The researchers found that both dryer types produced microfiber pollution, including water pollution from rinsing lint traps in the sink. While condenser dryers are ventless and do not exhaust microfibers into the air, the lint filter, condenser, and condensed water are all significant sources of microfiber water pollution.Future research is needed, however, to replicate the study using a larger sample size, as well as to explore strategies to sequester, dispose of, or eliminate laundry-based microfiber pollution.According to the authors, \"The appliance industry, its trade associations and legislators should recognize that all types of tumble dryer can be significant contributors to the problem of environmental microfiber pollution and begin efforts to mitigate this issue through revised usage instructions and improved appliance design. Current plans to introduce microfiber filtration systems into washing machines are expected to reduce the environmental impact of that stage in the laundering process, suggesting that reapplication of similar approaches to tumble dryers is a logical next step.\"Neil Lant, of Procter & Gamble, adds, \"Our recent work in collaboration with Northumbria University has recognized, for the first time, that the most important tumble dryer types used in Europe (condenser and heat pump) can also be significant contributors to aquatic microfiber pollution, especially if users wash lint filters in a sink. We do over 2 billion dryer loads in the U.K. each year, generating around 2,000 tons of microfiber. We can prevent around 90% of that from causing water pollution by cleaning lint filters into household waste, but to deal with the rest we'll need to redesign the air filtration systems in all types of dryers.\"John Dean, of Northumbria University, adds, \"By working collaboratively with the Procter & Gamble Newcastle Innovation Center's Dr. Neil Lant, and his colleagues, we have for the first time focused on microfiber release from vented and condenser dryers using real consumer laundry loads. It was found that the vast majority of microfibers released from dryers is collected in the lint filter, thereby preventing release into the environment. You realize that some manufacturers, however, then recommend regular washing of the lint filter under a running tap, which contributes directly to an increase of waterborne microfiber pollution.\"After considering the environmental impact of current domestic household practices, a simple remedy is proffered. Instead of washing the lint filter under the tap after use in the tumble dryer, simply clean the filter either by hand, a light brush, cloth, or vacuum cleaner, and dispose of the collected fibers, as dry waste, in household waste. This simple and effective procedure can reduce microfiber release from tumble dryers and contribute to the protection of the global natural water environment.\" More information:Impact of vented and condenser tumble dryers on waterborne and airborne microfiber pollution, PLOS ONE (2023).

  "text": "Rising temperatures due to climate change are likely influencing human migration patterns, according to a new study by Rita Issa of University College London and colleagues, published May 24 in the open-access journal PLOS Climate.          In the last decade, heat waves were frequent, and surface temperatures were the warmest on record. As the planet warms, many people are expected to leave their homes to escape extreme temperatures. However, the exact role of heat in human migration is not yet understood. To illuminate this relationship, Issa's team conducted a review of research documents, annual reports, working papers, government documents and scientific literature that examined the impact of heat on human migration or the heat that migrants experience along their journey.Of the 32 studies that considered how heat impacts migration, half found a correlation between exposure to heat and the likelihood that a person will migrate. The vast majority of the 18 studies that assessed the effects of heat on migrants as they travel reported negative health impacts, such as heat related illnesses, heat stress and early death. The research also reports that people suffered more greatly from the heat when they lived in regions with poor infrastructure, or had insufficient workplace adaptations, lower educational level and low socioeconomic status.The new study's findings suggest that heat likely influences human migration patterns, including the timing of when people move, the risks they face along the way and the heat they may experience once they settle. However, the fact that only half of the included studies found a correlation between heat and migration suggests that heat is not the only factor driving migration.The researchers point out that no literature has reported a \"temperature threshold\" above which people are certain to migrate. Instead, they propose the development of accepted ways to compare temperature measurements, heat impacts and environmental factors that cause migration, which they believe would support future efforts to study climate migrants and enact policies that protect them from harm.\"Migration is a valid adaptive response to extreme heat. Part of the reason there is no certain temperature at which people will migrate is instituting adaptive measures that limit the consequences of extreme heat, as we see in places like the UEA where air conditioning is widely used. However, often the poorest and most marginalized remain vulnerable to temperature extremes, including migrants,\" the authors add.\"These findings offer a dual opportunity for action: decisive policy to limit global heating upstream, through reducing carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions; and adaptive strategies that take into account human vulnerability\u2014spanning urban planning, occupational adaptations, household modification and more\u2014to assist in lessening the impacts of heat on human health, well-being and productivity.\" More information:Human migration on a heating planet: A scoping review, PLOS Climate (2023).

  "text": "Plastic pollution is seemingly omnipresent in society, and while plastic bags, cups, and bottles may first come to mind, plastics are also increasingly used to make clothing, rugs, and other textiles.          A new study from UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, published May 24 in the journal PLOS One, for the first time tracked the ability of natural, synthetic, and blended fabrics to biodegrade directly in the ocean.Lead author Sarah-Jeanne Royer conducted an experiment off the Ellen Browning Scripps Memorial Pier and found that natural and wood-based cellulose fabrics degraded within a month. Synthetic textiles, including so-called compostable plastic materials like polylactic acid (PLA), and the synthetic portions of textile blends, showed no signs of degradation even after more than a year submerged in the ocean.\"This study shows the need for standardizing tests to see if materials promoted as compostable or biodegradable actually do biodegrade in a natural environment,\" said Royer, who performed the research while a postdoctoral scholar in the Dimitri Deheyn laboratory at Scripps Oceanography. Royer currently remains affiliated with Scripps Oceanography as a visiting scholar from Hawai\u02bbi Pacific University. \"What might biodegrade in an industrial setting does not necessarily biodegrade in the natural environment and can end up as marine and environmental pollutants.\"Startling images of landfills stacked with mountains of thrown away clothing in Chile and Kenya show the global ramifications of fast fashion. An estimated 62% of textiles \u201468 million tons\u2014are now made from plastic fibers and plastic blends, which can persist in the environment for decades to centuries. Synthetic textiles also create plastic pollution from microfibers shedding during regular wearing and washing. Most washing machines are not designed to filter for microfibers, that then end up in wastewater, and ultimately the ocean.      Bio-based plastics made from renewable natural resources such as cornstarch or sugar cane have been marketed as a potential solution to the plastic problem. PLA is one such polymer in the bio-based plastics market, often labeled as biodegradable and compostable. The team chose this textile for the study given its extensive use as a replacement for oil-based materials.                Deployment of the sea surface experiment that took place off the Ellen Browning Scripps Memorial Pier at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 2019. Credit: Dimitri Deheyn             For the experiment, ten different types of fabrics were used including wood-based cellulose (known commercially as Lyocell, Modal, and Viscose); natural cellulose (organic virgin cotton and non-organic virgin cotton); bio-based plastic (PLA); oil-based plastic (polyethylene terephthalate and polypropylene), and fabric blends of Lyocell mixed with polyester and polypropylene. All these are commonly used in the textile industry. Polyethylene terephthalate is a type of polyester often marketed as a recycled textile. Polypropylene is used in textiles, carpets, geotextiles, packaging materials, and disposable medical textiles such as masks.The textile samples were placed in flow-through containers deployed both at the sea surface and at the seafloor approximately 10 meters (32 feet) deep. Samples were examined every seven days with images taken, and small pieces removed from duplicate samples for further examination in the lab. This included scanning electron microscopy to examine the fibers at high resolution, and Raman spectroscopy to gain information about the chemical composition and molecular structure of the fibers. The samples were then submerged again, in a process that lasted for 231 days at the sea surface and 196 days at the seafloor.After the conclusion of the Scripps Pier experiment, the samples were moved to the Experimental Aquarium at Scripps Oceanography, where samples were exposed to controlled conditions of flowing seawater. While the natural, cellulose-based textiles repeatedly disintegrated in 30\u201335 days, the oil-based and bio-based materials showed no sign of disintegration even after a total of 428 days.\"The natural, cellulose-based materials would disintegrate in about one month, so we would exchange for a new sample after the old one disintegrated,\" said Royer. \"The natural samples were replicated five times, while the plastic samples remained the same for more than a year.\"Examining the samples via electron microscopy allowed Scripps marine biologist Dimitri Deheyn, senior author of the study, to measure the size and structure of each fiber. The natural fibers became thinner with time, while the diameter of the plastic fibers remained the same showing no sign of biodegradation. Study co-author Francesco Greco performed the Raman spectroscopy analysis at the Department of Geology of Northwest University, China, looking at the structural-chemical degradation of the fibers. Greco, now at the Weizmann Institute of Science, found significant changes in the chemical fingerprint of the cellulose-based materials, while bio- and oil-based plastics remained unchanged.Fiber blends, which interweave natural fiber strands with bio- or oil-based plastic strands, are often promoted as a more sustainable alternative to textiles made entirely from synthetic plastics. This study showed, however, that only the natural part of the fiber degraded, with the plastic portion of the blend remaining intact.                Disintegration time in days for five selected types of material exposed to coastal waters at the Ellen Browning Scripps Memorial Pier located at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. Credit: Royer, et al.             Additionally, the same type of fabrics were tested in a closed-system bioreactor by an independent company, which replicates a marine environment in an enclosed, indoor system. The bioreactor allowed measurements of the percent of carbon dioxide produced by microbial activity using the fabrics as nutrients, which was thus used as a proxy for measuring biodegradability. The cellulose-based materials showed complete biodegradation within 28 days, whereas the oil-based and bio-based fibers did not show any sign of biodegradation.Study authors note that the bio-based polylactic plastic, marketed as an ecologically promising material, and the oil-based polyethylene terephthalate and polypropylene, represent an important source of human-caused pollution, and the fate of how these materials act in a natural environment should be further explored.\"This comparative study highlights how crucial our language is around plastics,\" said Deheyn. \"Indeed, a bioplastic like PLA, commonly assumed to be biodegradable in the environment because it contains the prefix 'bio,' is actually nothing like that.\"Given these results, Royer and the team hope consumers will become more aware of the power of their own choices.\"Consumers who are concerned about microfiber plastic pollution should be mindful of the materials they are buying,\" said Royer. \"We should all aim to buy fewer garments, opt for high-quality, cellulose-based materials like cotton, merino or wool that will last longer, or look to more circular and sustainable options that repurpose items like clothing swaps and Buy Nothing groups.\" More information:Not so biodegradable: polylactic acid and cellulose/plastic blend textiles lack fast biodegradation in marine waters, PLOS ONE (2023).

  "text": "Earlier this year, a new beer appeared on the menu at Fox City Brewing Company in Forsyth, Georgia. Opened three years ago in a former ice house an hour south of Atlanta, Fox City serves pale ales, stouts and other microbrews. The new addition, called Revival Lager, stands apart from anything it's made before\u2014and from nearly every other beer on tap in the U.S. Fox City's menu calls it a \"light, crisp, eco-friendly lager made from highly repurposed and recycled water.\" This is a delicate way of saying that it's made from treated sewage.          \"We flower up the verbiage a little bit, to make sure people try it,\" says Chris Bump, the brewer at Fox City, sitting in the taproom on a Tuesday afternoon in March. When a waitress brings over two pints of Revival, Bump, a 35-year-old Georgia native with tattooed arms, a full beard and floppy baseball cap, raises a toast before we both take a sip. It is, as advertised, a refreshing, easy-drinking beer.Bump did not wake up one morning and decide to try brewing a beer with recycled wastewater. The idea came to him via the Canadian water technology company H2O Innovation, which operates a sewage treatment plant in Forsyth and wanted a beer to serve at the annual symposium of the WaterReuse Association.Held this year in Atlanta, the event brings together hundreds of utility leaders, engineers and scientists to discuss the state-of-the-art in recycling water. A few hours after I shared a pint with Bump, cans of Revival would be served at a symposium party at the Georgia Aquarium, where self-professed \"water nerds\" mingled while manta rays and beluga whales swam behind glass walls.Fox City is not the first microbrewery to be enlisted in the cause of \"potable reuse,\" the industry term for reintroducing treated wastewater into a drinking-water supply. Utilities have spent decades trying to convince U.S. cities and towns that drinking recycled water is safe, but proposals for so-called \"toilet-to-tap\" systems have stirred up resistance and backlash. In response, advocates are increasingly turning to beer as a go-to strategy for helping consumers overcome the yuck factor.And as more cities find themselves squeezed between growing populations and drought-stressed water supplies\u2014making potable reuse a more attractive, if not inescapable, option\u2014wastewater beers are likely to proliferate in the years ahead.\"If you give somebody a glass of water and tell them that it's been purified from wastewater, more than likely one person out of two will not drink it,\" says Guillaume Clairet, chief operating officer at H2O Innovation. \"But if you convert that same water to beer, then all of a sudden nine out of 10 will.\"      In treatmentThe water Bump used to make Revival came from the northwestern edge of Los Angeles, where the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District recently opened a small demo facility as a showcase for the public to learn about potable reuse. Las Virgenes depends entirely on water from the California State Water Project, a 700-mile system of canals, dams and pumps that transports fresh water from the northern part of the state.After that water passes through toilets and drains in the district, it goes to a traditional waste treatment plant; from there, it's either discharged into a local creek (and eventually into the Pacific Ocean) or sent through specially designated purple pipes to irrigate parks and golf courses.Three years ago, Las Virgenes began piping a small fraction of the plant's outflow\u2014about 1 million gallons a day\u2014into the demo facility, where it is put through the additional steps of ultrafiltration (UF), reverse osmosis (RO) and an ultraviolet-advanced oxidation process (UV AOP) to be brought up to state's standards for recycled drinking water. Each step in this alphabet soup of water tech removes increasingly small contaminants, from bacteria to viruses to salts and hormones.\"The reuse industry is about belts and suspenders,\" says Clairet at H2O Innovation, which makes the UF and RO equipment used in Las Virgenes.When the WaterReuse Association suggested brewing a beer for its symposium, Clairet, who sits on the planning committee, took on the job of figuring out how to do it. He had hoped to get the water from the onsite treatment system at a hospital in Atlanta, which uses H2O equipment to recycle wastewater for heating and cooling, but Georgia state law lacked a framework to allow it to be used for drinking. So once Fox City was on board, Clairet called his contacts at Las Virgenes, who agreed to supply the water.In January, Las Virgenes put a half dozen 55-gallon drums of purified water on a truck to Forsyth, where Bump pumped it into his hot liquor tank\u2014the first step in the beer-making process\u2014and got to work. He had wanted to brew something more exotic than lager, but Clairet and the symposium's organizers insisted on a straightforward beer that highlighted the water's purity. (Hazy and funky are not necessarily desirable traits for a brew meant to counter people's associations with sewage.)\"I really enjoy making sour beers,\" says Bump. \"But the more I thought about it, that's probably not the best thing. So I think they made a good call there.\"Pitching potable reuseThe idea of making beer with recycled water originates with a brewer in Oregon named Art Larrance. Now retired, Larrance is co-founder of Cascade Brewing and a pioneer of the state's craft beer industry. For years, he sat on the advisory committee for Clean Water Services, a utility in suburban Portland that treats about 70 million gallons of wastewater per day, most of which gets discharged into the Tualatin River. At a meeting in 2014, the utility's management asked the committee to help think of ways to demonstrate that this water was safe to drink.\"I said, 'Well, let's just go make some beer with it, if it's that good,'\" recalls Larrance.Clean Water Services decided to host a competition among local homebrewers to make beer with its effluent. When the state's department of environmental quality called a public meeting about the idea, it immediately drew national attention. \"I probably got 100 media phone calls in the first 30 days,\" says Mark Jockers, then public affairs manager and now chief of staff at the utility. By the time the competition happened in the summer of 2015, more than 400 news outlets had covered it.That coverage included plenty of wisecracks about sewage and toilets, but it was also, by and large, the kind Clean Water Services had been aiming for. Most stories, according to an analysis commissioned by the utility, presented potable reuse in a favorable light. Jockers says the stunt successfully delivered the message that water-recycling technology is well-established.Last fall, a study by researchers at Stanford and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign found that recycled wastewater was as clean, if not cleaner, than the surface-water sources that supply many cities. Recycled water's recent history as sewage, paradoxically, means that utilities and regulators tend to put it through more rigorous treatment and testing than water from rivers and lakes, which, more often than not, includes the outflow of wastewater treatment plants. This reflexive bias makes recycled water some of the safest you can drink.Namibia, one the most arid countries in sub-Saharan Africa, has been recycling water for more than 50 years. (Lucas Van Vuuran, one of the scientists who helped develop the first plant there, also coined a favorite slogan of potable reuse advocates: \"Water should not be judged by its history, but by its quality.\")Singapore, a similarly water-stressed country that depends on neighboring Malaysia for its supply, has also been recycling water for decades; its water agency collaborated with a local brewer to sell beer made with treated water. Both countries employ so-called direct potable reuse (DPR) systems, where treated water is piped directly back into the drinking supply.In the U.S., such systems have proven to be a hard to sell. The largest water recycling plant in the world is in Southern California. Opened in 2008, the Orange County Water District's Groundwater Replenishment System can treat up to 130 million gallons of wastewater per day, enough to meet the needs of nearly 1 million people. For now, that water is used to help refill the aquifers that supply the region.This type of system, known as indirect reuse, puts an environmental buffer between treated water and drinking pipes. It serves as both quality control check and psychological crutch, allowing consumers to imagine pristine mountain brooks instead of bubbling tanks of sewage.For Clean Water Services' first beer competition in 2014\u2014before the utility had Oregon's permission to provide treated water to brewers directly\u2014it took water from the Tualatin River, just below where its treatment plant discharges, in a deliberate attempt to illustrate the flimsiness of the environmental buffer.\"We call that the waters of amnesia,\" says Jockers. \"You put the effluent in the river, and then you take it out, and magically, it's [drinking] water.\"In 2013, the drought-prone West Texas town of Big Spring began running the first DPR system in the U.S. But even there, the water flows into pipes where it mixes with the supply from local reservoirs and is then treated again before being delivered to homes. El Paso, about 300 miles west of Big Spring, is planning to skip this final redundancy with a DPR system, set to begin operating in 2026, that can provide up to 10 million gallons a day of drinking water.The city hasn't made a beer yet from its pilot plant, but it plans to, says Gilbert Trejo, vice president of operations and technical services for the local water utility, El Paso Water.'Activated Sludge'Since Clean Water Services' success in Oregon, recycled water brewing projects have spread to cities in California, Colorado, Arizona, Idaho and elsewhere. Beers with names such as Activated Sludge and One More Time Around have become a regular fixture at water engineering conferences and craft brewing festivals.Nearly 100 breweries have made recycled beers, according to Travis Loop, organizer of the Pure Water Brewing Alliance, a group of utilities, brewers, engineers and tech companies involved in these projects. \"People always love to sit down and share a beer and talk,\" says Loop. \"And about 90% of any beer is going to be water, so it just makes a lot of sense.\"Ironically, it was a macro-brewer that helped create the taboo against recycled water. After a particularly bad drought in the late 1980s, a utility in Southern California's San Gabriel Valley put forward a plan to replenish its underground aquifers with recycled water.Miller Brewing Company (now part of Molson Coors) at the time drew 1 billion gallons of water per year from the same reservoir for a local plant. Afraid of what customers might think, the beermaker joined public opposition to the plan\u2014helping coin the term \"toilet-to-tap\" and suing regulators, who shelved the project.That fight\u2014and the term that sprang from it\u2014has created an ongoing headache for cities looking to adopt water recycling plans. In El Paso, says Trejo, residents often take \"toilet-to-tap\" literally, imagining a pipe from their toilet to their sink with maybe a charcoal filter in between.For most Americans, water simply appears when they turn on the tap and disappears down the drain as if by magic. They don't think too much about what happens before or after because they don't have to. \"I call it the flush-and-forget society,\" says Aaron Tartakovsky, co-founder and CEO of Epic Cleantec, a San Francisco startup that designs, installs, and runs on-site water-recycling systems for apartment buildings and businesses. \"This entire infrastructure is very literally out of sight out of mind. And that's a problem.\"In Tampa, Florida, where city leaders have been searching for ways to meet growing demand for water without draining local rivers, plans to replenish reservoirs with recycled water instead of letting it flow into the Bay have repeatedly run aground due to lack of public support.The most recent proposal last year came under attack as part of a failed effort to unseat the city's Democratic mayor, Jane Castor, who supported it. The Tampa Bay Young Republicans produced an ad that used the \"toilet-to-tap\" label and showed a mother and daughter who pretended to be excited to drink glasses of brown \"potty water.\"This weaponization of potable reuse has been a setback in efforts to educate the public about recycled water, Brian Armstrong, executive director at the Southwest Florida Water Management District, told the audience during the WateReuse Symposium in March. \"Right now, the only way to get people to drink this is when we put it in beer,\" he said, only half-joking.In San Francisco, Tartakovsky has also found beer to be a useful conversation starter. Last year, Epic Cleantec took more than 2,000 gallons of water from its on-site purification system at a 40-story apartment building in the city's Mission District and delivered it to Devil's Canyon Brewing Company in nearby San Carlos, which used it to make a Kolsch-style ale called Epic OneWater Brew. The idea was to show regulators and industry folks that the company's technology produces water clean enough to drink.In 2015, San Francisco became the first city to require new large buildings to have on-site water reuse systems, but for now, those systems are limited to non-potable uses such as flushing toilets. Tartakovsky hopes the city\u2014and others\u2014will clear the way for on-site potable reuse.At the United Nations Water Conference in New York in March, Tartakovsky made the rounds passing out cans of OneWater Brew, including to executives at AB InBev and other global beer brands. \"I can tell you right now that we are already having conversations with some of the biggest brewers in the world about doing water reuse within their existing operations,\" he says.Back in Forsyth, Revival Lager sold out in April. Fox City set the price at $4 per pint, the cheapest on the menu, in part because the water was free. \"Everybody seemed pretty willing to accept it and try it,\" says Bump. \"You can't beat four bucks.\"    2023 Bloomberg News.

They found that analyzing surface wind speed and solar irradiance forecasts in Pennsylvania from 2017 to 2019 using machine learning improved analog forecasting accuracy in this case study.\"You want to understand how much energy you can expect for the day ahead,\" said Hu, who received his doctorate in geography from Penn State. \"You want to understand the risk\u2014no matter if you over predict or under predict there are going to be penalties like power shortages or overproduction. Our work shows we can improve the accuracy of these wind and solar forecasts.\"Analog forecasting is an alternative to numerical weathering prediction (NWP), which uses computer models to simulate how initial weather conditions will evolve in the days or weeks ahead. NWP has led to great advances in forecasting over the last several decades, but uncertainties remain.Those uncertainties are addressed in part by running a number of simulations, called ensembles, which show a range of possible future atmospheric states but are also computationally intensive and expensive to produce, the scientists said.\"Analog forecasting, however, can generate ensembles without expensive, repeated model runs,\" Hu said. \"It works by searching for historical forecasts that are most similar to the target forecast. And then the past observations associated with the most similar past forecasts make up the ensemble members.\"      The analog ensembles are produced by combining a deterministic forecast\u2014a highly detailed single run of an NWP model\u2014with past weather observations\u2014like temperature, pressure and humidity\u2014from past forecasts that are similar to the current one.The best analogs are chosen based on a similarity metric that weighs individual weather forecast predictors, but this process uses a constrained exhaustive search that limits the number of predictors that can be used and does not consider the relationships among predictors.\"That has been the limitation for analog ensemble forecasting,\" Hu said. \"This paper tries to address that by introducing a machine learning approach to learn the intricacy among predictors.\"The machine learning technique takes all the weather variables\u2014like temperature, pressure and humidity\u2014and transforms them into a latent space, or a clustered pattern that is helpful for selecting the ideal forecasts and analogs, the scientists said.\"This approach tries to identify the most helpful features to look for to improve analog forecasts,\" Hu said. \"Simply put, it is clustering the candidates, and that gives you the most accurate forecasts and pushes away the less similar points of data from less similar forecasts.\"The machine learning technique overcomes the computational limit posed by optimizing predictor weights in traditional analog ensemble forecasting, the scientists said.\"Machine learning has been used operationally for many years to speed up or improve the accuracy of predictions, however its role was mainly limited to post processing or data preparation,\" said Guido Cervone, Penn State professor of geography and meteorology and atmospheric science, Hu's adviser and a co-author of the paper. \"It is really during the last year or so that machine learning has been used as a central core of algorithms, often even replacing numerical model solutions.\"The results of the study, published in the journal Boundary-Layer Meteorology, suggest machine learning will enable more predictors to be used and will generate predictions with higher accuracy.\"Our work shows that a machine learning model can be used for looking at complex features even in a geosciences field,\" Hu said. \"In geosciences, we are dealing with hundreds of variables. In this search, we had more than 300. And most of the time they have a lot of correlations. We show machine learning can actually detect all those relationships from this large dataset.\" More information:Weiming Hu et al, Machine Learning Weather Analogs for Near-Surface Variables, Boundary-Layer Meteorology (2023).

  "text": "The Arctic, once again at the forefront of climate change, is experiencing disproportionately higher temperature increases compared to the rest of the planet, triggering a series of cascading effects known as Arctic amplification.          As concerns continue to grow, satellites developed by ESA have become indispensable tools in understanding and addressing the complex dynamics at play and the far-reaching consequences for the environment and human societies.Arctic amplification is the process whereby the Arctic region warms at a faster pace than the global average. This phenomenon is largely attributed to positive feedback mechanisms that exacerbate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions.This rapid warming is not only destabilizing the delicate balance of the Arctic ecosystem, but is having profound implications for global climate patterns, human populations and wildlife.ESA's Science for Society Arktalas Hoavva project, which in the northern Sami language means Arctic Ocean, is dedicated to the study of Arctic amplification using satellite data.A paper published recently in the Remote Sensing journal, describes how satellites have captured this climate phenomenon and how they are proving indispensable for monitoring the remote Arctic region, which is otherwise sparsely measured.                The Arctic is experiencing disproportionately higher temperature increases compared to the rest of the planet, triggering a series of cascading effects known as Arctic amplification. This rapid warming is not only destabilising the delicate balance of the Arctic ecosystem, but is having profound implications for global climate patterns, human populations and wildlife. The phenomenon is largely attributed to positive feedback mechanisms that exacerbate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. Credit: European Space Agency             Satellites have witnessed the impact of the amplification on phytoplankton and vegetation productivity as well as on human activity and infrastructure.For example, in May 2020, an emergency was declared after some 20,000 tons of diesel leaked from a power plant reservoir near Norilsk in Russia. The oil contaminated the Ambarnaya River, which flows into Lake Pyasino\u2014a large body of water.The disaster, the cost of which exceeded $2 billion, was caused by the collapse of a pillar\u2014it collapsed because the ground had become unstable as a result of thawing permafrost.Scientists used the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite mission to complement the analysis, field photographs, and historical data to attribute the accident to the Arctic amplification of global warming.      As well as causing problems for infrastructure, when permafrost thaws, it releases large quantities of methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, creating a dangerous positive feedback loop that further exacerbates global warming.The primary driver of Arctic amplification is the demise of sea ice, which has reached unprecedented low levels in recent years.A state of emergency has been declared after some 20 000 tonnes of diesel oil leaked into a river within the Arctic Circle. Images captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission show the extent of the spill. \u00a0 According to media reports, the spillage occurred when a fuel tank at a power plant near Norilsk, operated by a subsidiary of Norilsk Nickel, collapsed on Friday 29 May. The leaked oil is reported to have drifted around 12 km from the accident site. In this animation, diesel oil is visible in the Ambarnaya River on both 31 May and 1 June \u2013 easily identifiable in crimson red. The Ambarnaya River flows into Lake Pyasino \u2013 a major body of water and source of the Pysaina River. Copernicus Sentinel-2 is a two-satellite mission to supply the coverage and data delivery needed for Europe\u2019s Copernicus programme. The mission\u2019s frequent revisits over the same area and high spatial resolution allow changes in water bodies to be closely monitored. Credit: contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data (2020), processed by ESA, CC BY-SA 3.0 IGOSea ice is formed as seawater freezes to form freshwater ice. The freezing process rejects saline water, which is cold and much denser than the surrounding seawater and so sinks to the deep ocean driving global ocean thermohaline circulation.Without the formation of sea ice, this process will stop and lead to changes in global ocean circulation.As more ice disappears, the exposed dark ocean surface absorbs more heat, leading to further warming and ice loss.Furthermore, winds blowing over the exposed ocean surface increase surface waves through frictional coupling. Waves then inhibit refreezing by mechanically eroding the ice as it forms, and this may drive completely new and more energetic ocean circulation patterns across the Arctic Ocean, further tipping the region into a new dynamic state.ESA's CryoSat and Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite altimeters measure Arctic sea-ice thickness. The satellites precisely measure the height of ice surfaces relative to the ocean surface between ice leads, enabling scientists to determine ice thickness and volume.This data has revealed significant declines in Arctic sea ice, particularly during the summer months, highlighting the urgency of the situation. The ESA SMOS satellite complements these data providing measurements of ocean-surface salinity and thin sea ice in the marginal ice zone. These are complemented by Copernicus Sentinel-1 radar imagery providing all-weather sea-ice mapping capabilities. When used together with infrared imagery from Sentinel-3, this is a formidable multi-satellite monitoring capability for the Arctic regions.This animation shows the average extent of sea ice in the Arctic from 1979 until 2022. The demise of sea ice has reached unprecedented low levels in recent years. As more ice disappears, the exposed dark ocean surface absorbs more heat, leading to further warming and ice loss. Credit: European Space AgencyIn addition to measuring sea ice, ESA-developed satellites have facilitated the observation of other vital parameters, including surface temperature, albedo, and atmospheric composition.These measurements allow scientists to study the intricate feedback mechanisms that contribute to Arctic amplification. For instance, the Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission provides valuable information on sea-surface temperature, aiding in the analysis of oceanic heat fluxes and their impact on ice melt.In addition, the melting of the vast Greenland ice sheet, fuelled by Arctic amplification, is contributing to rising sea levels globally. The release of freshwater from melting ice into the North Atlantic Ocean is disrupting oceanic circulation patterns, potentially leading to more extreme weather events such as storms and heatwaves in various parts of the world.As well as individual satellite missions shedding new light on the remote Arctic, scientists are creating long-term datasets through ESA's Climate Change Initiative. These 40-year-long datasets, complied with data from numerous satellites, enable researchers to study the long-term trends and variations in the Arctic, contributing to a better understanding of the region's response to global warming.The data collected by ESA-developed satellites not only enhance our knowledge of Arctic amplification, but also support decision-making processes and the development of effective mitigation and adaptation strategies.Governments, policymakers, and scientific communities rely heavily on these satellite observations to assess the environmental impact, predict future scenarios, and inform policies for sustainable management of the Arctic region.                Arctic amplification is the process whereby the Arctic region warms at a faster pace than the global average. This phenomenon is largely attributed to positive feedback mechanisms that exacerbate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. This rapid warming is not only destabilising the delicate balance of the Arctic ecosystem, but is having profound implications for global climate patterns, human populations and wildlife.

Credit: European Space Agency             The importance of the Arctic is reflected in the Copernicus system that is now evolving to implement new satellite capabilities prioritizing new Arctic measurements that are urgently needed by Copernicus Services, including the dual-frequency CRISTAL altimeter, the Copernicus Imaging multi-frequency Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) and ROSE-L, an L-band synthetic aperture radar mission.Together with existing Copernicus data, satellite measurements of the Arctic will provide an unprecedented monitoring capability at the time of dramatic changes driven by anthropogenic climate change.ESA's Craig Donlon said, \"The phenomenon of Arctic amplification and its relationship to the global climate emergency serves as a stark reminder that the consequences of climate change are not distant threats but immediate and accelerating crises, impacting not only people living in the Arctic, but ultimately all of us.\"Our paper outlines how satellite observations have captured Arctic amplification as it is developing and with good spatial detail. These observations are indispensable for monitoring of amplification in this remote and inhospitable region that is sparsely sampled by ground observations.\"Satellite data are unique in their ability to capture and monitor environmental transitions in the Arctic region that both precede and follow the emerging impact of Arctic amplification.\" More information:Igor Esau et al, The Arctic Amplification and Its Impact: A Synthesis through Satellite Observations, Remote Sensing (2023).

  "text": "With the rise of extreme weather events, which are becoming more frequent in our warming climate, accurate predictions are becoming more critical for all of us, from farmers to city-dwellers to businesses around the world. To date, climate models have failed to accurately predict precipitation intensity, particularly extremes. While in nature, precipitation can be very varied, with many extremes of precipitation, climate models predict a smaller variance in precipitation with a bias toward light rain.          Researchers have been working to develop algorithms that will improve prediction accuracy but, as Columbia Engineering climate scientists report, there has been a missing piece of information in traditional climate model parameterizations\u2014a way to describe cloud structure and organization that is so fine-scale it is not captured on the computational grid being used.These organization measurements affect predictions of both precipitation intensity and its stochasticity, the variability of random fluctuations in precipitation intensity. Up to now, there has not been an effective, accurate way to measure cloud structure and quantify its impact.A new study from a team led by Pierre Gentine, director of the Learning the Earth with Artificial Intelligence and Physics (LEAP) Center, used global storm-resolving simulations and machine learning to create an algorithm that can deal separately with two different scales of cloud organization: those resolved by a climate model, and those that cannot be resolved as they are too small.This new approach addresses the missing piece of information in traditional climate model parameterizations and provides a way to predict precipitation intensity and variability more precisely.\"Our findings are especially exciting because, for many years, the scientific community has debated whether to include cloud organization in climate models,\" said Gentine, Maurice Ewing and J. Lamar Worzel Professor of Geophysics in the Departments of Earth and Environmental Engineering and Earth Environmental Sciences and a member of the Data Science Institute.\"Our work provides an answer to the debate and a novel solution for including organization, showing that including this information can significantly improve our prediction of precipitation intensity and variability.\"Using AI to design neural network algorithmSarah Shamekh, a Ph.D. student working with Gentine, developed a neural network algorithm that learns the relevant information about the role of fine-scale cloud organization (unresolved scales) on precipitation. Because Shamekh did not define a metric or formula in advance, the model learns implicitly\u2014on its own\u2014how to measure the clustering of clouds, a metric of organization, and then uses this metric to improve the prediction of precipitation. Shamekh trained the algorithm on a high-resolution moisture field, encoding the degree of small-scale organization.\"We discovered that our organization metric explains precipitation variability almost entirely and could replace a stochastic parameterization in climate models,\" said Shamekh, lead author of the study, published by PNAS. \"Including this information significantly improved precipitation prediction at the scale relevant to climate models, accurately predicting precipitation extremes and spatial variability.\"Machine-learning algorithm will improve future projectionsThe researchers are now using their machine-learning approach, which implicitly learns the sub-grid cloud organization metric, in climate models. This should significantly improve the prediction of precipitation intensity and variability, including extreme precipitation events, and enable scientists to better project future changes in the water cycle and extreme weather patterns in a warming climate.This research also opens up new avenues for investigation, such as exploring the possibility of precipitation creating memory, where the atmosphere retains information about recent weather conditions, which in turn influences atmospheric conditions later on, in the climate system. This new approach could have wide-ranging applications beyond just precipitation modeling, including better modeling of the ice sheet and ocean surface.

  "answer_squad": " AmazonFACE",
  "text": "In the depths of the Amazon, Brazil is building an otherworldly structure\u2014a complex of towers arrayed in six rings, poised to spray mists of carbon dioxide into the rainforest. But the reason is utterly terrestrial: to understand how the world's largest tropical forest responds to climate change.          Dubbed AmazonFACE, the project will probe the forest's remarkable ability to sequester carbon dioxide\u2014an essential piece in the puzzle of world climate change. This will help scientists understand whether the region has a tipping point that could throw it into a state of irreversible decline. Such a feared event, also known as the Amazon forest dieback, would transform the world's most biodiverse forest into a drier savannah-like landscape.FACE stands for Free Air CO2 Enrichment. This technology first developed by Brookhaven National Laboratory, located near New York City, has the ability to modify the surrounding environment of growing plants in a way that replicates future levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.\"Plants absorb carbon dioxide along with water and light to produce sugars and release oxygen. What happens when one increases this input? We don't know,\" David Lapola, one of the leading scientists of the project, told The Associated Press. \"We have evidence from similar experiments in temperate forests, but there is no guarantee that the behavior will be the same here in the Amazon.\"Lapola, a professor at the State University of Campinas, argues that the tipping point of the Amazon rainforest is more likely tied to climate change rather than the rate of deforestation. Thus, it is crucial to study the impact of higher concentrations of carbon dioxide in the forest to understand what lies ahead.This perspective challenges the widely quoted study by Earth system scientist Carlos Nobre. According to Nobre, if deforestation reaches a critical threshold of 20% to 25% across the Amazon, the balance of the region's rainfall system will be disrupted, leading to the transformation of the lush rainforest into a savannah.\"Even if we halted deforestation in the Amazon basin today, the forest would still be at risk of experiencing the consequences of a tipping point due to climate change,\" Lapola said. \"While stopping deforestation remains our primary responsibility, combating the climate change driven by atmospheric factors is not something that Brazil or other Amazonian countries can address alone.\"The construction of the initial two rings is underway and they are expected to be operational by early August. Each ring will consist of 16 aluminum towers as high as a 12-story building. The carbon dioxide will be supplied by three companies to avoid any shortage.Situated 70 km (44 miles) north of Manaus, the project is led by the National Institute for Amazon Research, a federal institution, with financial support from the British government, which has pledged $9 million. It should be fully operational by mid-2024.Luciana Gatti, an atmospheric chemist, praised the initiative and said it would be highly beneficial to replicate the project in the four quadrants of the Amazon, as the carbon absorption capacity varies significantly across the region, which is twice the size of India.Gatti, who is not directly involved with AmazonFACE, coauthored a landmark study published in the journal Nature, which revealed that the eastern Amazon has ceased to function as a carbon sink, or absorber for the Earth and has transitioned into a carbon source.

  "answer_squad": " PNAS Nexus",
  "text": "Almost half of mercury exposure comes from mercury embedded in global trade, according to an analysis of the global flows of the toxic metal. Mercury is a neurotoxin that harms human health in even very small doses.       Zhencheng Xing, Ruirong Chang, and their colleagues traced the element through international trade routes from sites of pollution to exposure in the environment, and accounted for the resulting human health impacts. The authors linked a mercury emission inventory, a global multi-regional input-output model, a coupled atmosphere-land-ocean-ecosystem model, and an exposure-risk-valuation model to investigate the global biogeochemical mercury cycle.The world emits about 1,800 megagrams of mercury annually. Most of these global emissions are linked to the smelting and pressing of non-ferrous metals, particularly during artisanal and small-scale gold mining.Mercury used in these processes can wash downstream and become airborne, polluting soil, rivers and parts of the ocean. People are then exposed through eating seafood, freshwater fish, or rice\u2014sometimes many thousands of miles away from the mercury's source.Many developed countries, including the United States and Japan, can be classified as outsourcers of mercury because developed countries are the ultimate consumers of gold, electric equipment, machinery, and other products whose production produces mercury pollution, but such countries are spared exposure. According to the authors, strategies to tackle mercury exposure should include both production-side controls and demand-side measures, including consumption taxes to influence consumer behavior.The work is published in the journal PNAS Nexus.

  "answer_race": " The new study on cascading earthquakes.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the supercomputer used to study the Ridgecrest earthquakes?",
  "answer_squad": " SuperMUC-NG",
  "text": "On the morning of July 4, 2019, a magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck the Searles Valley in California's Mojave Desert, with impacts felt across Southern California. About 34 hours later on July 5, the nearby city of Ridgecrest was struck by a magnitude 7.1 earthquake, a jolt felt by millions across the state of California and throughout neighboring communities in Arizona, Nevada, and even Baja California, Mexico.          Known as the Ridgecrest earthquakes\u2014the biggest earthquakes to hit California in more than 20 years\u2014these seismic events resulted in extensive structural damage, power outages, and injuries. The M6.4 event in Searles Valley was later deemed to be the foreshock to the M7.1 event in Ridgecrest, which is now considered to be the mainshock. Both earthquakes were followed by a multitude of aftershocks.Researchers were baffled by the sequence of seismic activity. Why did it take 34 hours for the foreshock to trigger the mainshock? How did these earthquakes \"jump\" from one segment of a geologic fault system to another? Can earthquakes \"talk\" to one another in a dynamic sense?To address these questions, a team of seismologists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego and Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU) led a new study focused on the relationship between the two big earthquakes, which occurred along a multi-fault system. The team used a powerful supercomputer that incorporated data-infused and physics-based models to identify the link between the earthquakes.Scripps Oceanography seismologist Alice Gabriel, who previously worked at LMU, led the study. The findings were published May 24 in the journal Nature online, and will appear in the print edition June 8.\"We used the largest computers that are available and perhaps the most advanced algorithms to try and understand this really puzzling sequence of earthquakes that happened in California in 2019,\" said Gabriel, currently an associate professor at the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at Scripps Oceanography. \"High-performance computing has allowed us to understand the driving factors of these large events, which can help inform seismic hazard assessment and preparedness.\"Understanding the dynamics of multi-fault ruptures is important, said Gabriel, because these types of earthquakes are typically more powerful than those that occur on a single fault. For example, the Turkey\u2013Syria earthquake doublet that occurred on February 6, 2023, resulted in significant loss of life and widespread damage. This event was characterized by two separate earthquakes that occurred only nine hours apart, with both breaking across multiple faults.      During the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes, which originated in the Eastern California Shear Zone along a strike-slip fault system, the two sides of each fault moved mainly in a horizontal direction, with no vertical motion. The earthquake sequence cascaded across interlaced and previously unknown \"antithetic\" faults, minor or secondary faults that move at high (close to 90 degrees) angles to the major fault. Within the seismological community, there remains an ongoing debate on which fault segments actively slipped, and what conditions promote the occurrence of cascading earthquakes.The new study presents the first multi-fault model that unifies seismograms, tectonic data, field mapping, satellite data, and other space-based geodetic datasets with earthquake physics, whereas previous models on this type of earthquake have been purely data-driven.\"Through the lens of data-infused modeling, enhanced by the capabilities of supercomputing, we unravel the intricacies of multi-fault conjugate earthquakes, shedding light on the physics governing cascading rupture dynamics,\" said Taufiqurrahman.Using the supercomputer SuperMUC-NG at the Leibniz Supercomputing Center (LRZ) in Germany, the researchers revealed that the Searles Valley and Ridgecrest events were indeed connected. The earthquakes interacted across a statically strong yet dynamically weak fault system driven by complex fault geometries and low dynamic friction.The team's 3D rupture simulation illustrates how the faults considered strong prior to an earthquake can become very weak as soon as there is fast earthquake movement and explain the dynamics of how multiple faults can rupture together.\"When fault systems are rupturing, we see unexpected interactions. For example, earthquake cascades, which can jump from segment to segment, or one earthquake causing the next one to take an unusual path. The earthquake may become much larger than what we would've expected,\" said Gabriel. \"This is something that is challenging to build into seismic hazard assessments.\"According to the authors, their models have the potential to have a \"transformative impact\" on the field of seismology by improving the assessment of seismic hazards in active multi-fault systems that are often underestimated.\"Our findings suggest that similar kinds of models could incorporate more physics into seismic hazard assessment and preparedness,\" said Gabriel. \"With the help of supercomputers and physics, we have unraveled arguably the most detailed data set of a complex earthquake rupture pattern.\"The study was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program, Horizon Europe, the National Science Foundation, the German Research Foundation, and the Southern California Earthquake Center.In addition to Gabriel and Taufiqurrahman, the study was co-authored by Duo Li, Thomas Ulrich, Bo Li, and Sara Carena of Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany; Alessandro Verdecchia with McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and Ruhr-University Bochum in Germany; and Frantisek Gallovic of Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic.

I did go outside briefly and winds are getting very gusty with intermittent rains,\" Beckie Merrill, a 46-year-old middle school teacher, told AFP from a southern area of the island.After predicting a \"direct hit\" on Guam, forecasters later said the typhoon had moved just north of the island.\"It looks like we are getting a near hit with the eye passing through the Rota Channel.

At the Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference in Anchorage on Tuesday, Gov. Mike Dunleavy signed a measure he successfully pushed through the legislature that would allow the oil-reliant state to cash in on the sale of so-called carbon credits to companies looking to offset their carbon emissions. Projects could include credits for improving a forest's health through thinning or by allowing trees to grow bigger, thereby increasing a forest's potential to hold carbon.\"This bill is going to allow us now to have conversations worldwide with individuals involved in the carbon market. Just like oil, just like gas, just like our timber, this is a commodity that can be monetized now,\" he said.Lawmakers cast the bill as allowing Alaska to have the best of both worlds\u2014continuing to permit oil drilling, mining and timber activities while also stepping into the potentially lucrative market for sequestering carbon dioxide. But some watching Alaska's foray into this sector wonder if the program will gain traction as Dunleavy and lawmakers have said the aim isn't restricting emissions but generating a new revenue stream.

Shelley Hughes said she was not fond of the carbon credit concept but was concerned that without embracing it, the state could face backlash from groups over its support for oil and gas projects, including its backing of Willow.\"I think that in order to get capital investment into our state, we are going to have to be perceived in a way that is trying to work through all of this,\" she said during the recent legislative debate.The bill that passed last week was one of two proposed by Dunleavy as a way to generate a new form of income for the state, which has struggled with deficits for much of the last decade. It would allow the state to set up carbon sequestration projects on forestland and sell credits to companies seeking to offset their emissions, with 20% of the revenue from such sales going to a state fund that supports renewable energy projects.The bill also would let the state lease lands to third parties that want to manage sequestration projects of their own, such as reforesting areas burned by wildfire or growing kelp.

Credit: AP Photo/Mark Thiessen             It could be several years before the first credit sales occur because of the time it will take to set up a program and develop or vet projects.Another Dunleavy proposal that would have set up a regulatory system allowing for underground storage of carbon dioxide did not advance this session but remains in play for next year's legislative session.Dunleavy said Alaska would continue to be known as an \"oil and gas giant\" but also noted the potential for further development of renewables and other alternative energy in the state. To those who think Alaska is taking a risk with its new carbon plan, \"I think it's a great risk,\" he said.During the legislative debate on the carbon plan, some Republican lawmakers said the measure would allow Alaska to capitalize on the demand for carbon emissions offsets from companies already doing business in Alaska that might otherwise purchase carbon credits elsewhere.\"So if they're going to do it anyways and they're going to operate (on) Alaskan lands, then why shouldn't we provide the service of carbon offsets to these companies?\" Republican Rep. Kevin McCabe said. \"At least then it stays in Alaska and we get some benefit to our state treasury for it.\"    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

  "text": "A new study published in Geology concludes that an extinct volcano off the shore of Portugal could store as much as 1.2\u20138.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of ~24\u2013125 years of the country's industrial emissions.          For context, in 2022 a total of 42.6 megatons (0.0426 gigatons) of carbon dioxide was removed from the atmosphere by international carbon capture and storage efforts, according to the Global CCS Institute. The new study suggests that carbon capture and storage in offshore underwater volcanoes could be a promising new direction for removal and storage of much larger volumes of the greenhouse gas from the atmosphere.\"We know that most countries, including Portugal, are making efforts to decarbonize the economy and our human activities, this is a message that this may be one of the instruments to solve the problem\" says Ricardo Pereira, a geologist at the NOVA School of Science and Technology, and co-author of the study.Storing carbon dioxide in an extinct volcano would rely on a process known as \"in situ mineral carbonation.\" In this process, carbon dioxide reacts with elements in certain types of rocks to produce new minerals that safely and permanently store the carbon dioxide. Elements like calcium, magnesium, and iron combine with carbon dioxide to form the minerals calcite, dolomite, and magnesite, respectively.Rocks that contain large amounts of calcium, iron, and magnesium are ideal candidates for this process\u2014such as the volcanic basalts that make up most of the sea floor. Knowing this, the researchers targeted an offshore volcano for a few reasons\u2014the structure of the volcano could provide an ideal architecture for carbon injection and storage, the rocks are the right type for the reactions involved, and the location Is not too close to large populations, but also not too far.Most carbon capture projects have relied on injection of carbon dioxide into porous sedimentary basins that are sealed to prevent migration of the gas out of reservoirs. In these cases, the carbon will eventually start to form minerals, but only over longer periods of time\u2014decades to centuries. In 2016, researchers published findings  that 95% of carbon dioxide injected into underground basalts in Iceland had mineralized within just two years. The much shorter mineralization time makes the process safer and more effective\u2014once carbon is stored in minerals, issues like potential leaks are no longer a concern.      Davide Gamboa, a geologist at the University of Aveiro and co-author of the study, explains, \"What makes mineral carbonation really interesting is the time. The faster it gets into a mineral, the safer it becomes, and once it's a mineral, it is permanent.\"                Schematic cross-section of the Fontanelas volcano, indicating possible sites for carbon dioxide sequestration. Credit: Pereira and Gamboa, 2023             The researchers studied the storage potential at the ancient Fontanelas volcano, which is partially buried ~100 kilometers offshore from Lisbon, with a peak ~1500 meters below sea-level.To estimate the potential volume of carbon dioxide that could be stored at this site, the authors used 2D and 3D seismic studies of the undersea volcano that had been produced during offshore oil exploration, as well as data from samples that had been dredged from the area in 2008. The dredged samples contained naturally formed carbonate minerals, indicating that the chemical reactions required to store carbon were already happening, and that intentional efforts to mineralize carbon in these rocks should be successful.The samples also had up to 40% pore space\u2014meaning there are spaces within the rocks where carbon dioxide could be injected and mineralized. The researchers also indicate that low-permeability layers imaged around the flanks of the volcano could help with containing the carbon dioxide before it is mineralized.While this study demonstrated a large potential carbon storage capacity at the Fontanelas volcano, the authors highlight that many other places around the world may have similar offshore volcanoes that could be candidates for carbon capture and storage.

  "question_squad": " What is the tendency of cities to trap heat?",
  "answer_squad": " urban heat island",
  "text": "The tendency of cities to trap heat\u2014a phenomenon called the \"urban heat island,\" often referred to as the UHI effect\u2014can lead to dangerous temperatures in the summer months, but new Penn State research published in Buildings suggests that certain urban factors can reduce this effect.          The study found that trees had a cooling effect on outdoor air temperature, mean radiant temperature and predicted mean vote index, a measurement designed to evaluate thermal comfort levels.Additionally, the researchers determined that higher building-height-to-street-width ratios\u2014when taller buildings create shade for thinner adjacent streets\u2014as well as pavement that is better at reflecting sunlight, or having higher \"albedo,\" both led to lower mean radiant temperature and greater comfort levels.Guangqing Chi, professor of rural sociology, demography and public health sciences in the College of Agricultural Sciences, said the findings could help encourage the adoption of measures that create more favorable temperatures in cities\u2014especially for low-income communities, people of color and the elderly, who are disproportionately impacted by the UHI effect.\"Global warming makes some human habitats unbearably hot, but more so for socially and historically disadvantaged communities,\" Chi said. \"This interdisciplinary project provides an effective, equitable urban design solution for enhancing resilience against extreme heating.\"The study, a collaboration between the College of Agricultural Sciences and the College of the Arts and Architecture's Hamer Center for Community Design in the Stuckeman School, was based in Philadelphia, a city that\u2014according to the researchers\u2014experiences high rates of both poverty and extreme weather.For example, a 2021 study found that Philadelphia had the highest poverty rate out of the most populated cities in the United States, with 22.8% of people in the city living below the poverty level. The city also has experienced its snowiest winter, two warmest summers, wettest day and two wettest years on record since 2010.Farzad Hashemi, a Hamer Center researcher who will graduate in August with a doctorate in architecture, said this combination of socioeconomic and climate factors made Philadelphia an ideal location for the study.      \"Heat island hotspots and mortality rates tend to be greater in urban blocks with a socially disadvantaged population,\" Hashemi said. \"This is due to the combination of physical factors, such as impervious surfaces and lack of vegetation, and social factors, such as vulnerability to heat-related health effects.\"Researchers from the Hamer Center, a research and outreach arm of the Stuckeman School's Department of Architecture, initiated the idea for this project. Led by Lisa Iulo, associate professor of architecture, the Hamer Center's goal is to empower communities to tackle intricate challenges concerning the built environment, such as climate change, urbanization and social justice.For the study, the researchers used the social vulnerability index, or SVI\u2014gathered by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2014along with data about tree coverage to identify two neighborhoods in the city. One had the lowest SVI and high tree coverage and another had the highest SVI and the lowest tree coverage.Then, they used digital tools to construct 3D models of each neighborhood, incorporating information on construction materials, land cover, albedo and heat generated by human activities. Additional data included environmental factors, such as air temperature and mean radiant temperature\u2014or the heat given off by buildings and other infrastructure\u2014and urban morphology, such as surface albedo and building-height-to-street-width ratios.Finally, the researchers ran 24-hour simulations for six scenarios\u2014winter, spring, summer, fall, extreme hot and extreme cold\u2014in each neighborhood to see how different factors affected each other.The researchers found that while trees can create a cooling effect, these benefits are limited to their immediate surroundings. Areas without trees had significantly higher mean radiant temperatures, and the effect of trees on air temperature decreased as distance from the tree canopy increased.Chi, also a co-funded scholar of the Social Science Research Institute, said the findings suggest ways that urban climate knowledge can contribute to better city planning and design.\"For example, using taller and denser buildings alongside pavement surfaces with higher albedo could be considered to support more comfortable thermal conditions, particularly in urban blocks with less vegetation coverage,\" he said. \"Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering urban morphology and vegetation coverage in the design of sustainable and livable urban environments.\"Hashemi said this project could form the basis for future research utilizing longer simulation cycles and incorporating information on indoor thermal comfort.\"Our study focused on Philadelphia, which is in the U.S. Northeast region,\" he said. \"Expanding the data to incorporate more cities from other climate zones, including hot and dry or extremely cold, could give us a better understanding of the effects of urban properties on varying climates and social vulnerability indexes.\"Ute Poerschke, professor of architecture, also participated in this work.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the USGS organization that quickly characterizes earthquakes?",
  "answer_squad": " NEIC",
  "text": "Three studies now published in The Seismic Record (TSR) offer an initial look at the February 6, 2023 earthquakes in south-central T\u00fcrkiye and northwestern Syria, including how, where, and how fast the earthquakes ruptured and how they combined as a \"devastating doublet\" to produce damaging ground shaking.          The two earthquakes, a magnitude 7.8 followed approximately nine hours later by a magnitude 7.6, took place at the tectonically active and complex junction between the Anatolian, Arabian, and African plates along the East Anatolian Fault (EAF) strands. Most recent large earthquakes have taken place on the North Anatolian Fault in T\u00fcrkiye, while only three moderately sized earthquakes\u2014the largest at magnitude 6.8\u2014have occurred on the EAF within the past 50 years.First analyses of rupture and aftershocksThe epicenter of the first, magnitude 7.8 mainshock is located about 15 kilometers east of the EAF. The epicenter of the second, magnitude 7.6 earthquake is on the S\u00fcrg\u00fc-Misis Fault Zone (SMFZ) about 90 kilometers to the north of the first earthquake.The first earthquake ruptured the EAF bilaterally (in two different directions away from the epicenter), over a fault length of about 350 kilometers (including aftershocks) in 80 seconds, creating surface fault offsets of more than six meters, according to an analysis by P. Martin Mai of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology and colleagues. The second earthquake also ruptured bilaterally over roughly 170 kilometers (including aftershocks) over 35 seconds, with more than seven meters of surface fault offset, they note.An analysis led by Gesa M. Petersen of Helmholtz Centre Potsdam GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences suggests the first mainshock ruptured up to 560 kilometers in multiple phases over a total of 117 seconds, while the second earthquake ruptured about 115 kilometers over 32 seconds, with aftershocks being distributed along roughly 160 kilometers of the SMFZ.In this study, the researchers traced the rupture direction of each earthquake, showing that the first involved multiple directional phases and segmented rupture. Their analysis of mainshocks and aftershocks provided new details about how the EAF and SMFZ ruptured and illuminated a previously unmapped fault segment close to the Turkish city of Malatya.In their TSR paper, Dara E. Goldberg of the U.S. Geological Survey and colleagues relied on optical and radar imagery, available in the first few days after the sequence began, to clarify the rupture trace. As new imagery became available, the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) updated source characterization and impact analyses to reflect new understanding of the rupture extent. In total, the group mapped more than 340 kilometers of rupture associated with the mainshock and roughly 175 kilometers of rupture associated with the subsequent event.Mai and colleagues said that the occurrence of two large earthquakes taking place so close in time as a \"doublet\" is uncommon, but that the first mainshock may have created stress changes in the area of the second earthquake's epicenter that caused failure at the SMFZ.Goldberg and colleagues argue that statistically there is about a 7% chance of an earthquake triggering a doublet, indicating this behavior is not anomalous.Aftershocks from the two earthquakes demonstrated a variety of mechanisms, including strike-slip, normal and thrust faulting, said Petersen and colleagues. Strike-slip mechanisms similar to the two mainshocks are observed on the northeastern EAF segments and along most of the SMFZ, while the team observed normal faulting aftershocks in the southwestern EAFZ segments, as well as clustered at the western termination of the SMFZ.Combined with the way the rupture process appeared to jump between different fault segments, Petersen and colleagues suggest that the evolution of the T\u00fcrkiye earthquake rupture processes is similar in the degree of complexity to the 2022 Denali, Alaska of 2016 Kaikoura, New Zealand earthquakes.      Rapid responseThe USGS NEIC rapidly characterizes earthquakes around the world, and its products like ShakeMap and PAGER (Prompt Assessment of Global Earthquakes for Response) are often sought by researchers in the immediate aftermath of a large earthquake, said Goldberg and colleagues. In the case of the T\u00fcrkiye earthquakes, traffic to the USGS public earthquake event web pages had 1,035,364 visits in the 24 hours after the start of the sequence.In keeping with their role as a first-order indicator of how government agencies might respond in an earthquake's aftermath, NEIC released its initial ShakeMap for the magnitude 7.8 event 15.7 minutes after the start of the sequence, and its PAGER assessment 21.2 minutes after the earthquake's origin time, with similar timing for the subsequent event, according to Goldberg and colleagues.Ground motion detailsMai and colleagues write that strong motion recordings made during the first mainshock found that peak ground acceleration (the maximum ground acceleration that occurs during earthquake shaking at a particular location) reached up to 2g locally. This measure corresponds to extreme perceived shaking and very heavy damage.Rupture in both earthquakes stopped abruptly, which could have contributed to radiation of strong seismic shaking, these researchers note. Ground motions from the second mainshock would have then hit buildings weakened by the first mainshock, possibly increasing damage and destruction as a result.PAGER, the U.S. Geological Survey's loss estimation product, likely underestimated the impact of the sequence as a whole, because it does not consider repeated shaking due to aftershocks, write Goldberg and colleagues. A composite ShakeMap that includes the maximum shaking intensity at each location for the entire earthquake sequence may be more appropriate to estimate losses for this damaging earthquake sequence, they conclude.If a composite ShakeMap had been used as input to PAGER, PAGER's final assessment of the sequence would have included 30,000 total deaths and $51 billion in economic losses, said Goldberg and colleagues.

  "text": "Precipitation patterns and their variations over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are mainly dominated by the Asian summer monsoon (ASM), westerlies, and their interactions. The exact extent of the ASM's influence, however, remains undetermined. The northern boundary of the ASM denotes the northernmost position, with its leading edge advancing from south to north after its outbreak.          In addition, the unique topography and location of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) enable the ASM to penetrate deeply into the mid-latitudes. Thus, the northern boundary of the ASM could be considered as a boundary between the monsoon and the westerlies. Although some studies on the northern boundary of the EASM have mentioned the northern monsoon boundary of the TP region, these studies do not fully address the rationality of the boundary position in the TP.In addition, the strength and extent of the ASM during different periods will also change under the external forcing and internal variability. Therefore, a precise and reliable northern boundary index is urgently needed to examine relative changes in the ASM position and the extent of and variation in the circulation system during different periods over the TP.To overcome these issues, the northern boundary of the ASM over the TP is defined in this paper to precisely identify its position and variability. The ASM delivers substantial moisture to the TP. The ASM's subsystems, the SASM and the EASM, primarily affect the southern and eastern areas of the TP, respectively, forming a rainfall pattern that decreases from southeast to northwest during the rainy season.Referencing the climatological northern boundary index of the East Asian summer monsoon, this study is an attempt to evaluate its accuracy in reflecting the boundary position by considering natural geographical features such as climate and ecology and the movement of the ASM over the TP. Finally, the present study further analyzes the annual spatial characteristics of the northern boundary and demarcates the westerlies and monsoon domains over the TP.                (a) Zonal and (b) meridional water vapor budgets. Red dashed line represents the 300 mm precipitation isoline during the 2001-2020. Credit: Science China Press             The results show that the CNBI can reasonably illustrate the northern boundary of the ASM over the TP. Geographically, the climatology of the northern boundary of the ASM is distributed along the eastern Qilian Mountains-Tanggula Mountains-Qiangtang Plateau-Gangdise Mountains-Western Himalayas.This boundary roughly coincides with the boundary of the endorheic and exorheic basins of the TP. Climatically, the climatological northern boundary of the ASM is characterized by the convergence of westerly and southerly winds in the low troposphere and a distinct boundary between changes in the net zonal and meridional (westerlies and monsoon) water vapor budget and changes in precipitation, reflecting the interface between dry and wet regions during the rainy season over the TP.      Ecologically, the interannual fluctuation range of the climatological northern boundary index corresponds well to the distribution of grasslands and meadows over the TP.Based on the interannual variation range of the northern boundary of the ASM, we define the region north of the southernmost boundary of the interannual variability of the northern boundary of the ASM as the westerlies domain, the region south of the northernmost boundary of the interannual variability of the northern boundary of the ASM as the monsoon domain, and the area between the southernmost and northernmost boundary as the westerlies-monsoon transition domain over the TP.This study could serve as a foundation for further investigation into the interactions between westerlies and monsoon, variations in precipitation patterns and hydrological-ecological systems over the TP.The findings are published in the journal Science China Earth Sciences.

  "text": "The risk of catastrophic flooding in the Tulare Lake Basin has diminished as cool temperatures have predominated this spring, flattening the melt curve of the Sierra's epic snowpack, state officials said Monday.          We are \"not forecasting nearly as severe of damage as perhaps we were looking at several weeks ago,\" Brian Ferguson, deputy director of crisis communications for the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services, said at a news conference Monday. \"However, we want to strongly emphasize that we are not out of the woods by any stretch of the imagination.\"Just a few weeks ago, officials worried that floodwaters from the melting Sierra Nevada snowpack would surge down the Tule, Kings, Kaweah and Kern rivers and topple berms, breach levees and inundate towns such as Corcoran and Stratford.They now say their most conservative models don't anticipate the lake exceeding a height of 184.1 feet above sea level\u2014well below the 192 feet of newly reinforced levee protecting Corcoran, and roughly 2 feet lower than the forecast they delivered on April 21.Indeed, Mehdi Mizani, the Department of Water Resources' lead engineer on the Tulare Lake Basin, said the latest models suggest water levels will top out at around 181.1 feet on May 31, flooding approximately 620,000 acre-feet.In 1983, one of the last few times the lake flooded, roughly 1 million acre-feet inundated roughly 85,000 acres.Mizani said the state's models incorporate the combined effects of weather, reservoir releases, agricultural demands and evaporation, although they don't consider the reliability or strength of levees\u2014which could impact the extent of flooding if they were to fail.And the modeling process is \"iterative,\" he said. He and his team are \"continuously working on refinements for the models, whether it's just calibrating the models themselves or better understanding local operations to make sure that we're capturing those correctly.\"UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain agreed the cool spring thus far has helped alleviate flooding concerns.\"We've gotten relatively lucky so far,\" Swain said during a briefing Monday. \"We've threaded that needle\u2014there's been a lot of water coming downhill\u2014but it has not all come downhill at once.\"      However, the threat of the \"Big Melt\" remains cause for concern as much of the deepest snowpack in the southern Sierra Nevada has yet to melt.\"There is still a huge amount of water up there, and I think folks may be forgetting this because at low to middle elevations, the snow is largely gone,\" Swain said.\"But at high elevations, where the vast majority of that actual snow water equivalent is, there's still huge snowpacks\u2014they're still clearing roads in the High Sierra right now that have 20 to 30 feet of snow on them\" at 8,000 to 10,000 feet.Temperatures are beginning to heat up, he said, and some areas along the Merced River in Yosemite National Park are under flood watches and warnings as high flows are expected in the next few days.But the main area of concern remains the Tulare Lake Basin, he said, which has no outlet and is still filled with deep and stagnant water from this year's winter storms. Though a warm atmospheric river event or a prolonged heat wave could produce major flooding in the area, even gradual snowmelt threatens to make the current inundation worse.\"There's still major concern about Corcoran and some of these towns that are literally within this basin,\" Swain said. \"Agricultural land in that area is going to be flooded for months, and there's still significant risk to populated areas in parts of the San Joaquin Valley for the next few weeks at least, and probably for the next couple of months.\"The state is stockpiling sandbags and other emergency equipment should the weather change, Ferguson said.\"While I think perhaps the most serious risk may have been averted, we don't know what we don't know,\" Ferguson said, listing the many variables that could influence the speed, strength and amount of water flowing through the rivers.\"So while you know I think perhaps the most serious risk may have been averted, we don't know what we don't know yet in terms of how fast the water comes down the mountain, what levee may have squirrels in it that we're not aware of, or a million other things that we don't necessarily control as human beings,\" he said.\"And so, while we are looking far, far better than we have in the past, we just want to emphasize that the public in these communities should continue to be aware of the challenges that lie ahead and that we will continue to be in this situation for at least through the month of July.\"    2023 Los Angeles Times.

  "question_squad": " What is biochar?",
  "answer_squad": " a carbon-rich material",
  "text": "A new review of research suggests that the nature-based technology biochar\u2014a carbon-rich material\u2014could be an important tool to use in agriculture to help mitigate climate change.          Made by pyrolysis, a process that involves heating organic material in a low-oxygen environment, biochar\u2014a charcoal-like, porous substance\u2014has long been utilized for crop production as a soil amendment or carbon sequestration agent. In recent years, researchers have seen a resurgence of heightened interest in the technology due to its unique physical structure and its various agricultural and environmental benefits.It's for these reasons that biochar's potential to remove large amounts of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere deserves to be re-evaluated, said Raj Shrestha, lead author of the study and a research associate in horticulture and crop science at The Ohio State University.\"When farmers grow their crops, they apply fertilizer and/or manure and use different kinds of machinery to till the soil,\" said Shrestha. \"In the process, greenhouse gases are produced and released into the atmosphere.\"But farmers could lessen this impact by applying biochar to their fields, according to the paper, recently published in the Journal of Environmental Quality.\"If we can convince farmers that converting biomass to biochar is good for the long-term sustainability of soils, the economy, and good for the environment, then we'll be able to see wide adoption of this technology,\" said Shrestha.The researchers reviewed more than 200 field studies conducted across the globe that examined the impact of biochar application in agriculture on emissions of nitrous oxide, methane and carbon dioxide\u2014heat-trapping gases that cause Earth's atmosphere to warm.The team found that the amount of biochar in the soil does have variable effects on local greenhouse gas emissions, which range from a decrease to an increase, and, in some cases, no change. But in general, the team discovered that the use of biochar in field settings lowered the amount of nitrous oxide in the air by about 18% and methane by 3%.      Biochar alone was also not effective at reducing carbon dioxide emissions, but did help when combined with commercial nitrogen fertilizer or other organic materials, like manure or compost.\"We can achieve negative emission in our agroecosystems by reducing the carbon source and enhancing carbon sink,\" said Shrestha. Reducing Earth's carbon source can be achieved by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our activities, and enhancing carbon sink\u2014increasing the technology's ability to absorb more carbon than it releases into the atmosphere\u2014can be done by increasing the long-term soil carbon pool through conversion of organic waste into biochar, he said.\"What's good about biochar is that it contributes to both these aspects to create net negative agriculture,\" said Shrestha.\"Right now, when farmers leave crop residue on the field, only about 10% to 20% of the residue carbon is recycled into soil during the decomposition process, but by converting the same amount of residue to biochar and then applying it to the field, we can store about 50% of that carbon into stable carbon forms.\"As biochar-carbon placed in the soil can also last anywhere from a few hundred to thousands of years, it's currently one of the proposed best management practices for achieving negative emissions and preventing Earth's average temperature from increasing to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.According to the study, between 2011 and 2020, global greenhouse gas emissions rose: carbon dioxide by about 5.6%, methane by 4.2%, and nitrous oxide by 2.7%\u2014and agriculture accounts for about 16% of these emissions. While such levels have already led to irreversible changes to the global climate system, Shrestha said that future damages could be slowed by helping to curb the extent of emissions from the farming and forestry sectors.Yet despite biochar's potential as a negative emission technology and the recent increase in biochar-related research, it's difficult to get farmers to apply it, partly because it hasn't been commercialized for widespread use or promoted well, said Shrestha.To better deliver more science-based, practical information about the technology and its benefits to farmers and agriculture-related businesses, many lawmakers have enacted policies meant to investigate its effectiveness across many different soil types and environmental conditions. It's an objective that Shrestha shares, as the main goal of his team's review paper is to improve farmers' confidence in biochar so that more of them choose to adopt it sooner.

Tracking ice lost from the world's glaciers, ice sheets and frozen land shows that Earth is losing ice at an accelerating rate.       Using information from ESA's ERS, Envisat and CryoSat satellites as well as the Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 missions, research led by Tom Slater of the University of Leeds, found that the rate at which Earth has lost ice has increased markedly within the past three decades. Currently, more than a trillion tons of ice is lost each year.To put this into perspective, this is equivalent to an ice cube measuring 10x10x10 km over Oslo's skyline. Putting it another way, the amount of ice loss globally is equivalent to 12 000 times the annual water use of the Norwegian capital.Credit: ESA/Planetary VisionsThe sooner Earth's temperature is stabilized, the more manageable the impacts of ice loss will be.Continuity in satellite data is the key to predicting future ice losses, and to assist in mitigating the threats posed by sea-level rise, shrinking high mountain glaciers and further climate feedbacks.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the company that published a report on the need for the carpet industry to stop brushing evidence of harmful microplastics in their products?",
  "answer_squad": " Revolution Plastics",
  "text": "A report published this week focuses on the need for the carpet industry to stop brushing evidence of potentially harmful microplastics in their products under the mat.          Researchers are calling for floor covering manufacturers and suppliers to start being more transparent and to work together to find solutions to a growing problem.The joint report by Revolution Plastics at the University of Portsmouth and sustainability consultancy experts SB+CO concluded there are currently no microplastic reduction policies in the carpet industry.Researchers compared 51 companies from European clothing and carpet industries to evaluate if they had microplastics policies or provided information to customers about the microplastics in their products.They found that while the clothing industry was now starting to acknowledge the problem of microplastics shedding from their products, with new initiatives targeting zero impact, the carpet industry was a different story.Microplastics have been shown to have serious negative impacts on many animal species, including reduced growth, intestinal damage, aberrant development and reduced population growth. Recent studies have shown microplastics can enter human bodies, with plastic found in blood, liver, lungs and the placenta.Carpets are of particular concern, as it has been estimated that they can double the number of microplastics fibers in the home (Soltani et al. 2021). This, coupled with the fact that we spend up to 90 percent of our lives indoors, means there is potential for breathing in high concentrations of microplastics.Claudia Proietti from SB+CO, says, \"Of the 24 carpet companies investigated, we found they are heavily promoting the shift to using recycled plastics as a more environmental and sustainable solution, but are not yet considering the impacts of microplastics. Instead, durability, cleanability and low prices are the key selling points for plastic carpets. For example one manufacturer claims\u2014'this carpet is made from 100% polypropylene and bleach cleanable, offering extra durability and ensuring that you can clean your carpet with ease while retaining its color'.\"      The reports main findings were:None of the 24 carpet companies reviewed had a publicly-stated position on microplastics, yet all sold carpets made containing plastic. Almost 86 percent of the manufacturing companies included have a sustainability strategy or commitments, but microplastics are not included in the strategy. Consumers are unaware of the health issues associated with microplastics. Retailers only offer guidelines to highlight carpet qualities. The report recommends that carpet companies work together to standardize testing of microplastics in products (similar to that of the clothing industry that uses a washing machine test to determine the presence of microplastics). Researchers also urge manufacturers to be more transparent to consumers about using microplastics.Nigel Salter, from SB+CO says, \"Unbelievably, no information on the possible health impacts is made available to consumers. Human health is only noted in relation to chemical usage in carpet production, and even then, only a few companies focus on the issue.\"Dr. Fay Couceiro, Reader in Biogeochemistry and Environmental Pollution at the University of Portsmouth, has developed new methods for investigating levels of microplastics in the home.She says, \"It would be unrealistic to think we could just remove all carpets to solve the problem. However, the flooring industry needs to play its part and consider new ways to reduce the release of microplastics from carpets. We spend the majority of our time indoors, and microplastics can concentrate here, as many of the objects in our homes, schools and workplaces are plastic.\"Research by the University of Portsmouth has shown high levels of microplastics inside living areas. Dr. Couceiro is concerned about the impact of wear and tear on floor coverings. She adds: \"These plastic objects can release microplastics into a semi-closed environment where they are not diluted by large amounts of water or air, as they would be outside.\"When microplastics break up small enough, they can lift into the air as dust to be breathed in, or to later land on food and be eaten. It is therefore sensible to begin taking steps to limit our exposure where possible.\"Dr. Couceiro also fears consumers might be misled by environmental claims. \"What we are seeing is the flooring industry making strong environmental claims on their products and the use of recycled plastics,\" she explains.\"Our report is encouraging manufacturers to learn the lessons of the apparel industry and start taking action.\"The researchers conclude there is a real need for action. With so much global concern about microplastics, they say it's essential for all industries to join the conversation and be part of the solution.The hope is that this research will raise awareness of the issues and provide a platform for the carpet industry to start a meaningful dialogue on this topic.

  "text": "A safe supply of clean water is necessary for human survival\u2014yet 2.2 billion people around the world lack access to this basic human right. A global crisis is looming on water security, which has been escalated by climate change.          Now, researchers around the globe are collaborating to tackle the threat of climate change to humanity\u2014thanks to the Futures Climate Research Cohort Programme established by the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU) and the British Council.Leading climate change experts from five UK universities will work with 20 selected early-career researchers from 10 low and middle-income countries, including Bangladesh, Egypt, Ghana, India, Kenya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, South Africa, and Sri Lanka, to tackle their regional climate change challenges through knowledge exchange projects and research projects in the Global South.As part of the program, University of Warwick researchers from the Institute for Global Sustainable Development (IGSD) are leading the cohort to address water security in a changing world by investigating the inequality of water security, water for ecosystems and water-related hazards.The research will help us understand the uneven distribution of climate-change-induced water crisis across regions, populations, and ecosystems, empower vulnerable groups, and build resilience to risks and uncertainties. In addition to research, the program will help ECRs improve their skills, develop interdisciplinary collaborations, engage with stakeholders, and translate research into actions to support climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.Dr. Feng Mao, from the University of Warwick's IGSD said, \"As we learned from the UN Water Conference on 22 March and the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report, the need to unite the world for collective water research and action has never been more clear.\"\"Nearly 80% of the global population is exposed to water security challenges, with climate change intensifying the water cycle, altering rainfall patterns, and consequently bringing more frequent and amplified hazards to human societies in many regions.\"\"We will be addressing the intersections of water, ecosystems, society, and technologies\u2014aiming to improve lives and build resilience to climate change. Being part of the Climate Research Cohort will elevate Warwick University's position as a leading institute for environmental sustainability.\"Professor Elena Korosteleva, IGSD Director at the University of Warwick, added, \"IGSD has been relaunched to become the gateway to research on sustainable development at Warwick, with one of its key thematics being complex eco-systems and water security.\"\"I am very proud to see how our strategic thinking, research and leadership are now coming together, from growing our thematic networks across Warwick, to an IGSD leading scientist, Dr. Feng Mao, now representing us globally via the ACU. This is particularly opportune for our own launch of the ECR Sustainability Training School on 5-9 June 2023, which we hope will serve as a platform for raising a new generation of planet-conscious researchers and responsible citizens.\"The program's water security theme is led by three researchers from the University of Warwick's Institute for Global Sustainable Development (IGSD), Dr. Feng Mao, Dr. Nikoleta Jones, and Dr. Vangelis Pitidis.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards the new agreement?",
  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the state's largest fire?",
  "answer_squad": " Moose Fire",
  "text": "To stop a wildfire, an assortment of agencies must come together\u2014federal, state, tribal and sometimes local firefighters. But when the smoke clears, they must determine who shoulders the costs of the blaze, which can easily total millions of dollars.          The myriad agencies decide which lands they'll protect and how they'll pay for wildfires based on guidelines laid out in a master fire agreement. This month, the Idaho Department of Lands, which handles wildfires on state-owned land and some private forest land, signed a new agreement with federal and tribal partners\u2014shifting more responsibility on the state.The new agreement makes Idaho responsible for more areas where range land and forest meet growing housing developments\u2014also known as the wildland-urban interface area. The change, created by trades between state and federal agencies, has raised concerns that Idaho could foot larger bills in areas known to attract costly wildfires. And Idaho does little to regulate building in those areas.How are Idaho wildfires paid for?Craig Foss, Idaho's state forester, told the Idaho Statesman the new agreement is \"the first significant change\" to the state's master fire agreement since the 1980s.Idaho's new fire agreement parcels out agencies' jurisdiction over pieces of land. Typically agencies are solely responsible for the land they own. Others can still respond to those fires\u2014but the agreement determines who is in charge when a fire starts and, often, who pays for it.Agencies have always pitched in to fight fires in each other's jurisdictions, but that will become even more common under the new fire agreement, which expands the protocol to the entire state, Josh Harvey, Idaho Department of Lands fire bureau chief, told the Idaho Statesman.\"Essentially the whole state is under mutual aid,\" Harvey said. \"And what that means in the most simple terms is, whoever is the closest resource is going to respond.\"An agency can also be responsible for certain areas on another agency's property\u2014with offset agreements. For example, the U.S. Forest Service will cover some private timberlands in North Idaho that would typically fall to the Department of Lands. That's because the Forest Service has more firefighting resources in the area and specializes in fighting forest fires. In that case, the Forest Service wouldn't send a bill to the state for offset firefighting costs.For years, the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management had offset jurisdiction over some state-owned wildland-urban interface areas. They were largely in remote locations or areas adjacent to federal land, including parcels near Horseshoe Bend, Riggins, Garden Valley and Coeur d'Alene.During negotiations for the new fire agreement, the federal agencies said they wanted to hand jurisdiction in those areas back over to the Department of Lands.\"The Forest Service said, 'Our agency's mission, our fire responsibility is not private land, it's not the urban interface,'\" Harvey said. \"'Our responsibility and our agency's mission really is the federal national lands.'\"Harvey said the Department of Lands still needs to determine the exact acreage of wildland-urban interface returned to its jurisdiction. He said the department will have a clearer picture of the acreage in the fall. A preliminary map of the returned land appeared to show thousands of acres returned to the state agency.Harvey said that doesn't necessarily mean the state is on the hook for the entirety of costly firefighting bills. The master fire agreement outlines options for \"cost share agreements\" that the agencies can use in more complex fires, during which multiple agencies respond or fire burns several jurisdictions or properties.Those agreements can be based on combinations of expenditures, resources, ownership and more\u2014meaning the administrative side of firefighting will become more complicated, Harvey said.The change comes as the White House has indicated it's reticent to throw federal dollars at fires in the wildland-urban interface. In its 2023 Economic Report, President Joe Biden's administration said funding firefighting in wildfire-prone places reduces homeowners' perceived risk and can encourage people to live in areas where homes are more likely to burn.      Idaho taxpayers may face costlier firefighting billsHarvey said he was concerned when federal partners said they wanted out of wildland-urban interface jurisdictions.Many Idaho fires start on forest land when lightning strikes dry fuels. But increasingly, Harvey said, Idaho wildfires are caused by humans\u2014ignited by campfires, fireworks, exploding firearm targets or other sources. Idaho's largest fire last year, the Moose Fire near Salmon, started as a campfire that wasn't extinguished. It burned more than 130,000 acres, and three firefighters died in connection with the fire.That fire was on national forest land, but Harvey said most human-caused fires start in the wildland-urban interface.According to data from the Boise-based National Interagency Fire Center, the Department of Lands handles more human-caused fires every year than any other wildland firefighting agency. Though Idaho has had a string of mild fire years, the Department of Lands saw a record-breaking $68 million firefighting tab in 2021.Harvey said he thinks the new agreement will ultimately mean better firefighting responses in Idaho, even if it's possible the state bears more of the cost.\"The overall potential is that the state of Idaho is going to be paying a little bit more for fighting wildland fire going forward,\" he said.Jonathan Oppenheimer, external relations director for the Idaho Conservation League, said that's concerning for Idaho taxpayers, noting that a Pew Research Center report published in December showed many states vastly under budget for firefighting costs.Harvey said Idaho has \"taken some steps to get ahead, or at least get caught up\" on those costs. The Department of Lands has a firefighting budget it uses for prescribed burns and other mitigation efforts. It pays for firefighting costs separately through \"rainy day funds\" set aside by the Legislature.Still, Harvey said, the unpredictable nature of wildfire seasons could quickly impact those funds. In the next five to 10 years, smaller fires could become more expensive because they're in wildland-urban interface areas. Though the Department of Lands doesn't battle structure fires\u2014like burning homes\u2014firefighters expend a lot of resources to dig fuel breaks, drop fire retardant and other use techniques to prevent flames from reaching homes.\"We're going to be paying for more fires that historically we would not have,\" he said. \"And just overall, you know, the state of Idaho is growing so fast. How do you account for all of the urban interface that's expanding?\"New state fire jurisdiction is especially expensiveResearch shows protecting homes in the wildland-urban interface is expensive\u2014and doing so in rural areas, where homes are more spread out, is especially pricey. Judson Boomhower, an environmental economist at University of California San Diego, coauthored a study published in January that found Idaho is among the most expensive states in the West when it comes to government wildfire protection spending per home.\"(The data is) particularly important in places that we should expect to have repeated costly large fires and places where the density of development is really low,\" Boomhower told the Statesman in a video interview. \"If you have a cluster (of homes), the cost per house is lower than if you have very low-density homes.\"His research found that in places like Riggins, Garden Valley and Coeur d'Alene\u2014where the Department of Lands regained jurisdiction of swaths of wildland-urban interface land\u2014it can cost the federal government between $50,000 and $100,000 to protect a single home from wildfire over the lifetime of the home.Boomhower noted that many people who live in fire-prone areas aren't aware of just how risky their location is.\"It's a collection of ugly policy problems that are all coming together,\" he said.Oppenheimer said it's \"a matter of when\" some wildland-urban interface areas will be impacted by fire. That means Idaho should be stepping up to address building in fire-prone places, Oppenheimer said.\"From a policy perspective, there's kind of this increasing onus now, this weight upon the state that (it has) more of a role in protecting and safeguarding these communities,\" Oppenheimer said.Idaho zoning provides little guidanceBob McLaughlin, spokesperson for the Division of Occupational and Professional Licenses, told the Statesman that Idaho state laws have no regulations to address wildfire risk in construction.Statewide, Idaho follows the 2018 International Building Code. McLaughlin noted that the International Code Council has a wildland-urban interface code that some Idaho cities, like Boise and Ketchum, have adopted. It includes rules related to building locations and materials, defensible space around homes and water availability for firefighting.But many of the highest-risk areas haven't adopted such codes. Horseshoe Bend and Garden Valley are in Boise County, which doesn't address wildfire anywhere in its building codes. In Idaho County, where houses can cost tens of thousands of dollars to defend from fire, no building codes other than state requirements exist outside of city limits.\"So many times in Idaho County, I've seen houses burn down (where) I was like, 'Why in the world would you build right there?'\" Harvey said.Harvey said the Department of Lands now has jurisdiction over wildland-urban interface in Idaho County's Salmon River Corridor that is \"super ugly ground to fight fire in.\" It's a steep stretch of ground on either side of U.S. 95 between Riggins and Whitebird, where fires are fast-moving and hot.He said the state regaining jurisdiction in that area, which had long been Forest Service jurisdiction, \"was a topic of intense negotiation for a long time.\"\"There'll be a lot of cost shares and I think additional expense to the state of Idaho to provide fire protection (there),\" Harvey said.Could Idaho wildfire codes change?Changing Idaho's zoning and building codes to address wildfire risk would require buy-in from the state building code board, the public, and the Idaho Legislature. It would be a heavy lift, Oppenheimer said.\"There's a love for private property rights in Idaho,\" he said. \"That needs to be balanced with, 'How are we all paying as taxpayers for some of these choices that individuals make?'\"Boomhower said there's a bit of an incentive mismatch when it comes to wildland-urban interface regulations. States typically make decisions about where people can build, the materials they must use and the fire plans they may need to have. When the federal government is footing the bill for firefighting in those areas, smaller governments have less incentive to create those policies.It's hard to reconfigure that incentive, Boomhower said. Many state and local governments wouldn't be able to pay for wildland firefighting costs if the burden suddenly shifted.He said one possibility for building in fire-prone areas is \"some kind of development fee or upfront payment that basically equals the expected (firefighting) cost over the life of a development.\" Boomhower noted that, under a previous policy, some California homeowners in high-risk areas had to pay the state's firefighting agency to offset firefighting costs. He said the program was \"enormously politically unpopular.\"Harvey said he thinks some of the responsibility falls to local government to at least advise and educate homeowners about wildfire risk.\"(Local government should) regulate what it needs to look like as far as where somebody builds a home. It's a free country, but what people need think about is, 'Can a fire engine get in here if something happens?'\"    2023 Idaho Statesman. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "text": "Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation and the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology have successfully conducted the world's first simultaneous marine and atmospheric measurements at multiple locations directly beneath a violent, Category 5, which is the strongest class, typhoon in the North-West Pacific, before it reached land.          These observations were made directly beneath typhoon No. 11, called \"Hinnamnor\"/\"Henry\", in the summer of 2022. NTT and OIST plan to continue joint research contributing to observation methods that improve the accuracy of typhoon predictions, and to explain the mechanisms of interaction between the atmosphere and ocean using observation data from directly beneath typhoons.Typhoons, which can have major impacts on society and the environment, have recently been intensifying in strength and causing more damage due to global warming and other climate change effects. To prepare effectively for a typhoon, it is important to have an accurate understanding, as early as possible, of how the storm conditions will be upon landfall.However, there is currently no way to accurately know the state and intensity of a typhoon while it is still over the ocean from available satellite images and other observations. As such, typhoon information in weather reports is estimated based on analysis of weather satellite images with limited accuracy.In an effort to improve the accuracy of forecasts, a national research project used aircraft to make direct observations in 2017. This project demonstrated that observation data from aircraft can contribute to increasing the accuracy of typhoon forecasts.In 2013, OIST made marine and atmospheric observations directly under a very strong Category 4 typhoon (Typhoon No. 24, Danas) using a Wave Glider (model SV2) from Liquid Robotics Inc., an autonomous, unmanned surface vehicle which they nicknamed OISTER. This research demonstrated the need-to-know conditions accurately at the ocean's surface, directly below the typhoon. However, it has not been possible to make such observations accurately with stronger typhoons, because conditions become too severe.With a warming climate creating conditions conducive to intensification, research on typhoons has become increasingly important, as signified by the establishment of Japan's only research facility dedicated to the study of typhoons in 2021.In 2021, NTT and OIST began joint research to implement the observation of factors necessary to predict typhoons, even in the harsh environment of a strong typhoon. In 2022, NTT purchased a new Wave Glider (model SV3) which was called Seiuchi-san and began typhoon observations using both Wave Glider devices.                Observation data (top to bottom: air pressure, water temperature, significant wave height). Credit: Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology             Demonstration overviewTyphoon Hinnamnor began on August 28, 2022, near the island of Minamitorishima, with air pressure dropping to 920 hPa as it moved westward and became a violent, Category 5 typhoon. After checking the predicted path of the typhoon, the two Wave Gliders were put into operation.Seiuchi-san operated in the violent wind region, not less than 11 km from the typhoon center (with average wind speeds of 25 m/s or more), and OISTER operated in the strong wind region approximately 100 km from the center (with average wind speeds of 15 m/s or more). Both vehicles took atmospheric and ocean measurements simultaneously.                Major items observed. Credit: Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology             Air pressure is directly related to intensity of a typhoon, and Seiuchi-san was able to capture sudden, rapid changes in air pressure in the violent wind region of the typhoon. It was able to confirm the lowest pressure value at its closest approach to the typhoon, at approximately 20:00 on August 31. In contrast, OISTER made observations in the strong wind region, and was not able to recognize such drops.These experiments were also able to measure changes in the temperature of sea water, which is important in estimating the intensity of a typhoon. Changes in water temperature affect the supply of energy to the typhoon and correlate with the strength of the typhoon, so it is another essential element in predicting intensity precisely. With Seiuchi-san near the center of the typhoon, the scientists were able to detect that the drop in sea-water temperature (approx. 2\u00b0C) occurred more suddenly.Seiuchi-san also measured a maximum wave height of approximately 9 m. Since waves are caused by wind, knowing the wave height makes it possible to estimate wind strength. As such, it is useful to obtain wave height data from directly below a typhoon, but these data have been difficult to obtain from satellite observations.The data also showed changes in the speed of ocean currents as the typhoon passed. The researchers also measured ecosystem factors, including salt concentrations related to nutritive salts, and amounts of chlorophyll a, which is useful for analyzing phytoplankton. The team plan to perform more detailed analysis on the effects of typhoons in the future.These results were published in Scientific Online Letters on the Atmosphere (SOLA).The experiments also collected data on the behavior of the Wave Gliders themselves, in addition to atmospheric and ocean data, including orientation and movement. The scientists will analyze this behavior data and use it to improve observation equipment so that they can continue to make stable observations in the future. They also plan to continue accumulating and verifying observation data, and to develop explanations for the mechanisms of interaction between the atmosphere and the oceans.The research team aim to improve the accuracy of typhoon predictions by establishing methods for making typhoon observations, and to improve typhoon prediction models by explaining the mechanisms at work within typhoons. This will enable scientists to more accurately analyze and predict the conditions of typhoons before they reach land.In the future, the researchers also plan to collaborate with various industries and facilities to optimize methods for real-time typhoon observation, and to apply them in Earth Information Analysis Infrastructure Technology using the Space integrated computing network. They will also contribute to realizing a resilient society that can co-exist with typhoons, by adapting proactively to the environment based on highly accurate typhoon prediction.By using observation data to understand the effects of global warming on typhoons, and conversely, the effects of typhoons on the global environment, the researchers hope to gain a better understanding of the global environment, and be better able to promote changes in our society' behavior to preserve and regenerate the Earth.

  "text": "A pair of sociologists, one with the University of Milan-Bicocca, the other with the Climate Accountability Institute, has used survey data to calculate the amount companies should be paying in reparations to compensate for activities that have led to global warming.          In their study, reported in a Commentary piece published in the journal One Earth, Marco Grasso, and Richard Heede conducted a survey of hundreds of climate economists to learn more about the financial costs associated with global warming and who should be paying for disasters that have ensued as a result.Prior research has found that it is possible to tie certain environmental events to climate change\u2014the current heat wave in parts of South Asia, for example, or excessive flooding in Myanmar and Bangladesh. As it stands now, governments wind up paying to restore order in such areas, or in some cases, insurance companies pay for those who have coverage.In some instances, no one pays and victims deal with situations by rebuilding themselves or by moving to other areas. In this new effort, the researchers suggest that because many companies\u2014particularly those that produce and/or sell fossil fuels\u2014are involved in ventures that result in greenhouse gas emissions, they should pay their share of disaster relief.After averaging results, the researchers found that it was possible to assess amounts due from industry as a whole ($99 trillion for the years 2025 to 2050), certain segments of industry and even individual companies.They found, for example, that Saudi Aramco should be paying approximately $43 billion every year and Exxon should be paying $18 billion. Such funds, the researchers point out, could be paid into a global account to fund property restoration after environmental events and perhaps to find new ways to slow or even stop greenhouse gas emissions.The pair acknowledge that creating such a system and enforcing it would be difficult, as would managing such a system should it come to exist. But they also note that as the future unfolds and environmental disasters related to climate change become more frequent and more extreme, new sources of revenue are required to pay for them\u2014and billing those most responsible for it, they suggest, seems the most logical approach.

  "answer_race": " Supportive.",
  "question_squad": " What is the state's logging company called?",
  "answer_squad": " VicForests",
  "text": "By the end of the year, Victoria's trouble-plagued native forest industry will end\u2014six years ahead of schedule. The state's iconic mountain ash forests and endangered wildlife will at last be safe from chainsaws. And there will be no shortage of wood\u2014there's more than enough plantation timber to fill the gap.          Today's announcement by Premier Daniel Andrews is excellent news for forests, the state's economy, and its threatened species. We congratulate the Victorian government for this decision.Ending native forest logging is long overdue. For decades, we've known of how much damage it does to biodiversity. Logging vast areas of Victoria's native forests over the past several decades has pushed many once-common animals, such as the greater glider, to become endangered.Even now, the last remaining logging areas proposed under the state's Timber Release Plan overlap directly with the areas of highest conservation value for biodiversity.Our research has catalogued the damage done to produce low-value products such as woodchips and paper pulp. The industry never made economic sense. The state-owned logging company, VicForests, has been running at a loss for many years. The industry can switch to our abundant plantations of eucalyptus and pine.What damage did native forest logging do?The vast majority of areas slated for logging provide habitat for more than 50 threatened and rare species. We know that the more forests are logged, the less likely we are to find species such as the critically endangered Leadbeater's Possum. Logging pushes species into decline. Common species become threatened and threatened species move closer to extinction.The lead author of this article has been part of a team conducting ecological monitoring and research in Victoria's forests for almost 40 years.We have seen the damage first-hand. We've watched old forests of high conservation value be clear-felled when they should not have been. We've watched essential habitat such as large old trees, with their all-important nesting hollows, become rarer and rarer.We have seen extraordinary animals such as the Southern Greater Glider go from the most common species identified in night surveys to so scarce they're now endangered.We have seen once intact landscapes become dominated by highly flammable young forest at risk of extremely severe wildfires.And we watched in dismay as logging fragmented landscape. Now up to 70% of Victoria's critically endangered mountain ash forests are either severely disturbed by wildfire and logging or within 200 meters of such areas.      Native forest logging never made senseAlmost all (86%) of felled native forests in Victoria are turned into low-value products such as woodchips, paper pulp and boxliners.In 2018, we estimated sawn timber equates to just 14% of the volume of logs cut from native forests.By contrast, more than 80% of all sawn timber in Victoria comes from plantations. Native forest timber does not help build houses.Bringing forward the end of native forest logging from 2030 will be a major boost for climate action\u2014equal to removing 730,000 petrol or diesel cars from our roads every year. This single decision gives Victoria\u2014and Australia\u2014a far greater chance of meeting their emissions reductions targets.In its last annual report, VicForests announced a loss of A$54 million and a loan of $80 million. It's now propped up only by the Victorian Treasury.Even before these losses, the Victorian Parliamentary Budget Office showed the state would be $190 million better off without it.How can we help forests recover?Ending logging will take pressure off our forests. But we can't simply walk away from heavily damaged areas. Many areas have never properly regenerated after logging or repeated fire.In north-eastern Victoria, years of logging have warped the composition of tree species in the forest; many areas are dominated by trees that are largely unsuitable as food sources for koalas and greater gliders.The urgent task is to restore forests across Victoria while managing fire and invasive species such as deer.That's not all. We will still need wood and paper. Ending native forest logging requires getting things right in Australia's plantations.At present, we export up to 95% of all plantation eucalypt logs we grow for processing overseas. That's a missed opportunity for local jobs.Even now, the plantation sector is crying out for more workers in haulage and processing. This sector offers comparable jobs for workers leaving the native forest sector. But there will be other jobs: forest restoration, firefighting, feral animal control, carbon stock management and more. Getting the transition right is important.The exit from native forest logging must now be coupled with the declaration of a Great Forest National Park in the Central Highlands region. The region has been a hotspot for native forest logging in recent decades.It's almost ten years since the state's then-environment minister Lisa Neville promised this park would be declared. Once established, the new park should be co-managed with First Nations peoples to ensure Aboriginal self-determination, as well as good opportunities to work on Country.Today is a day for celebrating. At last, Victoria's government has acted for the future. Preserving our native forests is worth much more in carbon storage, water production and tourism than they ever were as woodchips.Victoria's move is a clarion call for other Australian states still doggedly logging their precious forests.

  "text": "Two billion people, including many Australians, will find themselves living in dangerously hot places this century if global warming reaches 2.7\u2103, research released today reveals.          The authors calculated how many people would be left outside the \"human climate niche\" by 2100. The niche is defined as places with an average temperature of about 13\u2103, or about 27\u2103 in the tropics. Human population has historically peaked in these areas.The world is on track for 2.7\u2103 of warming by 2100. This would push a third of people on Earth outside the human climate niche. This includes people in parts of northwest Australia such as Darwin, Broome and Port Hedland. It also includes parts of Southeast Asia, India, Africa and South America.Limiting warming to 1.5\u2103 would substantially reduce the number of people exposed, including most of those affected in northwest Australia.We were not involved in the research, which was conducted by researchers in the United Kingdom, China, Europe and United States. We are Australian experts in the health implications of global warming. Below, we discuss the broader implications of these globally significant findings.What is the human cost of global warming?The research calculated the number of people outside the \"human climate niche\" under different demographic scenarios and levels of warming. Exposure to unprecedented heat was the main factor pushing people out of the niche.This includes an average temperature greater than or equal to 29\u2103, as well as a high number of days with a maximum temperature above 40\u2103 or in humid places, with a wet-bulb temperature greater than 28\u2103. The wet-bulb temperature (as opposed to the standard dry-bulb temperature) reflects humidity and is a method used to measure heat stress. That's because it's the point at which sweating is no longer effective as a means of cooling.                Credit: Nature Sustainability             The study says a wet-bulb temperature of 35\u2009\u2103 can be fatal, especially for vulnerable people, because the body can no longer cool itself.Above the present level of about 1.2\u2009\u2103 global warming, the authors found exposure to unprecedented average temperatures increased markedly, along with increased exposure to temperature extremes.But 2.7\u2009\u2103 of warming threatens a third of the world's population. The below map shows where in the world people will suffer the worst heat. Almost the entire area of some countries, such as Burkina Faso and Mali in West Africa, would be exposed to unprecedented heat.      Why is warming a health hazard?Just last week, the World Meteorological Organization predicted global surface temperatures would rise to record levels within the next five years. The temperature is also likely to temporarily climb 1.5\u2103 above pre-industrial levels.This spells trouble for human health. Even incremental warming increases exposure to health hazards including potentially deadly heatwaves, infectious diseases and diet-related health issues.Let's be clear. A 1.5\u2103 world will result in injury and death, particularly for people in Asia and Africa. Importantly, the people most at risk will be the least capable of protecting themselves: children, the elderly and those with existing health conditions.While populations closer to the equator are more likely to experience heat-related harm, Australians are by no means immune.The risks to Australia of a 3\u2103 warmer world. Credit: Australian Academy of ScienceFor example, a 2019 study found heat-related health issues in Australia have been grossly underestimated. It found more than 36,000 deaths between 2006 and 2017 were attributable to heat.And experts predict Darwin could experience an average 265 days a year above 35\u2103 in a 3\u2103 warmer world.As in other parts of world, primarily high-risk populations in Australia will experience some of the worst impacts from a changing climate. In essence, climate change creates and maintains health inequities.To date, the Earth's average surface temperature has warmed 1.2\u2103 above pre-industrial levels. We must enact ambitious climate policies now if we are to change our dangerous trajectory.For too long, we have focused disproportionately on the economic costs of climate action for current\u2014often wealthy\u2014groups at the expense of considering the economic costs of inaction for all, including future generations.Historically health has rarely been included in these economic assessments, much less ethical considerations. Emissions reduction policies need to consider health and equity issues, and in doing so can provide governments with a strategic rationale to act.How can extreme heat harm health?There are multiple ways in which climate change can harm human health. Extreme heat can have direct effects, such as dehydration and heat stroke. Groups most at risk include the elderly and those already unwell.                The Climate Action Tracker charts policies and action against global mean temperature increase by 2100. Credit: Climate Action Tracker is an initiative of Climate Analytics and the NewClimate Institute Extreme heat can also harm mental health, increasing rates of injury and death by aggravating existing mental illness. Beyond direct effects, heat can affect health by influencing, for example, agricultural productivity, water security and air quality.There are physiological limits to adaptation, particularly to heat. These limits can have negative consequences for labour productivity, especially for outdoor workers, and for health service demand, leading to increased hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and ambulance calls.Pursuing adaptation measures in an effort to reduce the harmful effects of existing climate change is vital, but to protect the health of all, it is critical that we pursue strong emissions reduction measures.Developing healthier climate policiesAustralian climate action targets have improved under the Albanese government, however they remain incompatible with keeping warming to 1.5\u2103.Approving additional coal projects is not helpful for reducing emissions or demonstrating climate leadership.A commitment to develop and implement a National Health and Climate Strategy and establish a National Sustainability and Climate Unit are promising initiatives. This will help to address our woeful performance in a recent assessment showing how national climate commitments don't link with health.Last week, the Victorian Government committed to reducing emissions by 75-80% compared with 2005 levels by 2035. Their analysis indicates it will lead to A$5.7 billion in health benefits from improved air quality between 2035 and 2045.As today's new research states, the findings highlight the need for \"more decisive policy action to limit the human costs and inequities of climate change.\" Australia, in particular, must protect children, the elderly and the broader population from the harms they face in a warmer world.

  "answer_squad": " Acoustic Sensing of Glacial Discharge in Greenland",
  "text": "Acoustic signals can be effectively used for monitoring glacial runoff and provide a cheaper and more accessible alternative to existing methods.          Glaciers have been melting and shrinking at an alarming rate, raising the sea-level and causing outburst floods. Scientists are monitoring this change to gauge the meltwater contribution to the ocean and freshwater resources across the globe while also keeping an eye on the risk of glacial flooding. However, glacio-hydrological monitoring is a luxury not every country can afford. The process requires either a substantial effort by observers or sophisticated technology with large volumes of data.A team of scientists from Hokkaido University led by Evgeny A. Podolskiy, has proposed a safe, affordable, and effective approach for monitoring glacial discharge using sounds generated at the proglacial run-off site. The method, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, is not only ~100 times cheaper than the most novel methods but is also non-invasive, quick and easily deployable, and can become a tool for long-term glacier monitoring.Previous research, including that from the team, linked inaudible (infrasound) signals to glacial runoffs, noting a daily variation in the recordings and a peak during the summer. It was hypothesized that these signals might be generated by the radiation of air-pressure waves from the glacial runoff. Consequently, it was suggested that glacier discharge could be measured by analyzing the audible sounds that are also emitted by melting glaciers.                In the proposed method, an acoustic sensor is deployed in a sheltered location (red circle, bottom right, under the large rock) near the glacier to continuously record sounds; a much easier and simpler process.  Credit: Evgeny Podolskiy             The team of researchers conducted the first near-source study at Qaanaaq Glacier, Greenland, that showed acoustic noise levels scale with proglacial discharge, with an easy-to-detect, audible diurnal pattern. \"The ambient sound could be described as a continuous hum of roaring water, which would be familiar to anyone who walked near a white water,\" said Podolskiy.For recording the ambient soundscape, the team deployed a commercially available bird-song recorder near the terminus of the Qaanaaq Glacier. \"We estimated the proglacial discharge by water-depth and flow-speed measurements, which were collected at the intersectional site of the proglacial stream and the road between Qaanaaq and the local airport. The acoustic data was analyzed and the result was then cross-correlated with the discharge in order to single out a frequency band that was the best proxy for the proglacial stream,\" explains Podolskiy.      The highest correlation was seen in the frequency range of 50\u2013375 Hz. The scientists also found that the noise level clearly mimicked the temporal variation in runoff. Moreover, they observed that the acoustic signal was recorded ~50 minutes before a corresponding change in discharge.                A graph showing the correlation between the acoustic signal (black) and the measured proglacial discharge (red). Credit: Geophysical Research Letters (2023).  DOI: 10.1029/2023GL103235             The study demonstrated that audible acoustic signals can be used for sensing glacio-hydrological variations remotely and continuously. The method reduces the risk of instrument loss and does not require avant-garde data processing techniques. Although it does not provide the high spatial resolution of fiber-optic tools that are currently used, it breaks new ground in terms of affordability and overall simplicity. This method can be used to set up early-warning systems to timely detect events like glacier lake outbursts and help mitigate glacial flooding events.The team acknowledges that the sound-discharge relationships in glaciated watersheds may be complex. Future efforts might benefit from a long-term monitoring, clarified relationship between audible and inaudible sounds, as well as assessed interference effects of wind. More information:E. A.

  "question_squad": " What is the most important ingredient in chocolate?",
  "answer_squad": " cocoa beans",
  "text": "Chocolate sales have boomed in recent months. As the cost-of-living crisis bites, consumers are increasingly reaching for chocolate as a simple and affordable pleasure.          The most important ingredient in chocolate is cocoa beans, which come from plants grown in the tropics. About 70% of the world's cocoa comes from West Africa. The countries of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) and Ghana are two of the biggest producers.Meeting the world's insatiable appetite for chocolate has wrought a huge environmental cost, as the incredibly rich and diverse rainforests of West Africa are razed to make way for cocoa farms.Research by my colleagues and me, released today, sheds new light on the problem. By generating a new high-resolution map of cocoa growing areas in Ghana and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, we found the area under cocoa production is truly enormous\u2014and may be associated with up to 37% of forest loss in protected areas.The price of cocoa farmingThe Upper Guinean forests of West Africa have been classified as a \"global biodiversity hotspot\", due to their exceptional concentrations of plant and animal species found nowhere else on Earth. But much of this forest has now been destroyed.Since 1950, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire has lost up to 90% of its forest cover and Ghana has lost 65%. Cocoa has been a primary driver of this deforestation, together with other crops, mining and logging.But the exact contribution of cocoa plantations to the problem is not well understood. This is due in part to a lack of an accurate, high-resolution map of cocoa-growing areas.Without a map, we don't know where the chocolate we consume comes from. In particular, we don't know whether the cocoa was grown in formerly forested areas, or even illegally in protected areas.      What we didWe set out to determine the location and extent of cocoa plantations by using artificial intelligence (AI).We used a type of AI known as a \"neural network\", which allows computers to recognize and predict patterns in data. When a neural network is trained on satellite images showing different land uses, it can apply this \"understanding\" to identify the same land uses in satellite images of other geographic areas.In our study, we trained the neural network to recognize cocoa plantations across C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana. We did this using satellite images, together with the known locations of more than 100,000 cocoa farms.We then checked the accuracy of the information provided by the neural network, by engaging field teams to confirm the results at 2,000 random locations on the ground.This combination of advanced technology and hard fieldwork allowed us to create the first high-resolution map of cocoa production across West Africa. And what the map tells us is worrying.What we foundWe found that the land area devoted to cocoa is enormous, comprising more than 7 million hectares of plantations across both countries. The result is far greater than official figures\u2014up to 40% higher in Ghana's case.What's more, much of the cocoa plantation area exists in vast areas of what was once native forest. And more than 1.5 million hectares of land under cocoa production is located in protected areas.Deforestation in protected areas is a major issue globally. Given where we found cocoa growing, and where forest loss has been observed, we estimate more than 37% of deforestation in protected areas can be linked to cocoa production in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. For Ghana, the figure is 13%.How do we fix this?Our map demonstrates the massive role that cocoa may be playing in forest destruction in West Africa, including in protected areas.This is a complex problem, with no easy fix. Cocoa is grown by an estimated two million mostly small-scale farmers, who typically live below the poverty line on less than US$1 a day. Expanding their cocoa farms into forest is one way farmers and their families can maintain or improve their livelihoods.To fix this problem, we must help farmers manage existing farms in a more productive and sustainable way. Stronger law enforcement is also needed, to safeguard protected areas. Both will require action from governments and companies.More money from chocolate sales should end up with the farmer. And consumers may also have to pay more for their chocolate.Only determined changes on all these fronts will preserve the remaining forests of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana.

  "text": "A new greenhouse gas budget shows coastal ecosystems globally are a net greenhouse gas sink for carbon dioxide (CO2) but emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) counteract some of the CO2 uptake, according to international researchers led by Australia's Southern Cross University.          The new findings of the coastal greenhouse gas balance (CO2 + CH4 + N2O) in 10 world regions and globally are outlined in the paper, \"Coastal vegetation and estuaries collectively are a greenhouse gas sink,\" published May 22 in Nature Climate Change.From tropical lagoons to polar fjords, from coastal mangrove forests to underwater seagrass communities, many coastlines around the world show high diversity in greenhouse gas sinks and emissions.\"Understanding how and where greenhouse gases are released and absorbed in coastal ecosystems is an important first step for implementing effective climate mitigation strategies,\" said lead researcher, Dr. Judith Rosentreter, Senior Research Fellow at Southern Cross University.\"For example, protecting and restoring mangrove and salt marsh habitats is a promising strategy to strengthen the CO2 uptake by these coastal wetlands.\"Other activities to curb human impact, like reducing nutrients, organic matter, and wastewater inputs into coastal waterways, can reduce the amount of CH4 and N2O released to the atmosphere.The global team of scientists looked at ten different world regions: North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Russia, West Asia, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia and Australasia (see Figure 1).                Figure 1: The coastal greenhouse gas (GHG) budget (CO2 + CH4 + N2O) as CO2-equivalent fluxes (in teragrams of CO2-equivalent per year) in 10 regions around the world: Southeast Asia (9), North America (1), Africa (4) are strong coastal GHG sinks. South America (2), Australasia (10), and West Asia (6) are moderate coastal GHG sinks. East Asia (7) and South Asia (8) are weak coastal GHG sinks, and Europe (3) and Russia (5) are weak coastal GHG sources. Credit: Nature Climate Change (2023). DOI: 10.1038/s41558-023-01682-9             They found the strongest coastal greenhouse gas (GHG) sink was in Southeast Asia because of its extensive and productive tropical coastal wetlands that take up CO2. A second sink hotspot is North America, with its large areas of coastal wetlands but also CO2-uptaking fjords.\"Our new research shows that fjords around the world take up ~40% of CO2 that would otherwise be released from tidal systems, deltas and lagoons. Most (86%) of this important CO2 uptake by fjords comes from the North America region, mostly Greenland,\" said co-author Professor Bradley Eyre, Professor of Biogeochemistry at Southern Cross University.Dr. Rosentreter added, \"Other coastal habitats are sources of greenhouse gases. For example, coastal wetlands such as mangrove forests, coastal salt marshes and seagrasses, release more than three-times more CH4 than all estuaries in the world.\"At the same time coastal wetlands, also called coastal \"blue carbon\" wetlands, can be strong sinks of CO2 and some also take up N2O, which, on balance, makes them a net GHG sink for the atmosphere when all three greenhouse gases are considered.\"In our new study, we show that when we consider all three greenhouse gases (CO2 + CH4 + N2O), eight out of the 10 world regions are a coastal net greenhouse gas sink,\" Dr. Rosentreter said.The findings will inform the efforts of the Global Carbon Project's RECCAP2.\"The research was initiated by the Global Carbon Project to establish greenhouse gas budgets of large regions covering the entire globe, and for which the contribution of these coastal ecosystems remained unaccounted for,\" said co-author Pierre Regnier, Professor of Earth System Science at Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles.      Snapshot: Coastal greenhouse gas sinks and sources around the worldA dataset of observations from 738 sites from studies published between 1975 and 2020 was compiled to quantify CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes in estuaries and coastal vegetation in 10 global regions.Special coastal features (climate, hydrology, abundance) in each region around the world drive the GHG uptake and/or release from coastal systems.Strongest coastal greenhouse gas sinks:Top: the archipelagic region of Southeast Asia, because of its extensive and productive tropical mangrove forests and seagrasses that take up large amounts of CO2.Next: North America because of its large areas of salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrasses but also CO2-uptaking fjords.Third: Africa with large CO2 uptake by mangroves and seagrasses that is moderately reduced by estuarine GHG emissions.Moderate coastal greenhouse gas sinks:South America: moderate CO2 uptake by coastal wetlands, especially mangroves, and some estuarine GHG emissions.Australasia: long stretches of coastal wetlands that take up CO2, but this region also has a large number of estuaries along its coasts, many of which are a source of CO2, CH4 and N2O.West Asia: weak estuarine GHG source and moderate CO2 uptake by coastal wetlands, mostly seagrasses.Weak coastal greenhouse gas sinks:East Asia and South Asia: the moderate coastal wetlands CO2 sink is largely reduced by estuarine GHG emissions.Weak coastal greenhouse gas sources:Europe and Russia: both regions release more coastal GHG than they can take up from the atmosphere. These regions have many impacted tidal estuaries that release greenhouse gases; a colder climate also means they have fewer coastal wetlands (e.g., mangroves) that would otherwise take up large amounts of CO2.More information:Judith A.

  "text": "A new large-scale analysis of lake temperatures provides further evidence of some of the seasonal changes caused by climate change.          The research paper in Nature Communications uses lake temperature data, both historical and modeled to look at when typical spring or autumn conditions occur in lakes worldwide, to show exactly how much the seasons have shifted in different regions of the world and estimate how seasons will change in the future.Since 1980, spring and summer temperatures in Northern Hemisphere lakes have arrived earlier (2.0 and 4.3 days per decade, respectively), while the arrival of autumn has been delayed (1.5 days per decade) and the summer season lengthened (5.6 days per decade). This century, under a high-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario, current spring and summer temperatures will arrive even earlier (3.3 and 8.3 days per decade, respectively), autumn temperatures will arrive later (3.1 days per decade), and the summer season will lengthen further (12.1 days per decade).While we may all welcome an early spring and a long warm summer, that reaction would be simplistic. The results can have catastrophic effects for the natural world. Within the lakes themselves, aquatic species respond to thermal cues triggered by the lake temperature. In a stable climate, seasonal events such as spawning will occur at the same time and coincide with other events, which might provide a food source for example.Dr. Iestyn Woolway of Bangor University's School of Ocean Sciences is a leading authority in this field and his latest paper builds on previous research by developing a new methodology to look at seasonal shifts in lakes worldwide. Similar work exists for air temperatures and for oceans, but this is the first to look at the world's vital freshwater bodies which sustain the environment and provide for our own needs.One of the paper's focuses is the Great Lakes in North America. Larger than the U.K. in surface area, these large bodies of water affect large human populations and can even affect the U.S. economy. Detailed data for these lakes is easily picked up by satellite. Other than Windermere or Llyn Tegid, for example, most of the lakes in the U.K. are too small to be currently monitored in fine detail by satellite. These smaller lakes are included by local scale simulations.Interest in lake responses to climate change has increased over the past five years or so. While most studies look at temperature changes in individual lakes or average temperatures (mean conditions) in a small number of lakes, this study uses much larger and different data sets. Woolway is working to build a global picture (not including frozen lakes) of the fine-scale patterns in lake responses to climate change, answering for the first time, how climate change is affecting seasonal shifts in lakes.As Woolway explains, evidence from various satellite data sources enables him to extract a consistent pattern or response, while using large ensemble simulations attempt to get beyond the uncertainties and limitations which single models inevitably produce.

  "answer_squad": " resilience",
  "text": "From hurricanes in Houston to winter storms in Dallas, natural disasters can wreak havoc on a city. In any of these situations, policy makers, governing bodies, and aid programs need to know how to measure resilience\u2014the length of time it will take a city to bounce back.          An SMU research team led by engineering professor Nicos Makris measured Dallas's resilience by looking at anonymous cell phone data among residents in the Dallas metroplex before, during, and after the February 2021 North American winter storm. Their conclusion: Dallas recovered almost immediately after the winter storm ended, indicating Dallas exhibits a great degree of resilience.\"Despite millions of people losing power and water, forcing many to leave their homes immediately after the end of the storm, the city of Dallas reverted back to its pre-event response, showing that the city of Dallas has a great deal of resilience,\" Makris said. \"Citizens are very resilient individuals. They found ways to revert back.\"Measuring a city's resilience is important for planning responses to future events and revealing potential vulnerabilities. The applications for this research extend far beyond Dallas, as United Nations data reveal that more than half of the world's population currently lives in cities\u2014a number expected to grow to nearly 70 percent by 2050.Cities serve as global economic and cultural centers, but cities also tend to be in coastal areas and along fault lines, making them prone to acts of nature. This is compounded by climate change, which can enhance the strength or frequency of some of these natural hazards.The Dallas study was completed by Makris, Addy Family Centennial Professor in Civil Engineering in SMU's Lyle School of Engineering, along with SMU's Gholamreza Moghimi, Eric Godat, and Tue Vu. Moghimi is a postdoctoral research fellow at SMU, while Godat is the team lead for research and data science in SMU's Office of Information Technology (OIT). Vu also works in SMU's OIT as the AI & ML Research Scientist.The Dallas results reinforce Makris' studies of Houston cell phone data after the winter storm as well as data from Hurricanes Harvey (2017) and Irma (2017). Even after the major flooding due to Hurricane Harvey, Houston residents went back to their normal patterns almost immediately after the emergency was over.The study, 'Mechanical analogue for cities', has been published in Royal Society Open Science.      Measuring ResiliencePrediction is a tricky game because people, on an individual level, are unpredictable. However, group patterns are predictable using large datasets and mathematical models. Makris and his research team used GPS data from 13,000 cell phone users in the Dallas metroplex during February and March 2021 to evaluate when movement patterns went back to what they were before the winter storm.By assuming a mechanical model of the city, Makris' team was able to use the kind of mathematics that is usually applied to large numbers of particles to measure resilience.Most urban resilience is done in a qualitative way, which is helpful in looking back at what happened, but less helpful in making predictions. Makris wanted to find a quantitative way to measure urban resilience in hopes that it could help make predictions and point to vulnerabilities. \"We thought that maybe we could borrow concepts from physics to look at mobility patterns in large urban centers using GPS location data from cell phones.\"In order to crunch the numbers for the location data of 13,000 cell phone users over the course of a month, Makris's team partnered with SMU's Eric Godat, a physicist who leads a dedicated team that assists researchers across campus in using the University's high-performance computing cluster. The HPC cluster has the computing capacity to do ensemble averaging, a kind of machine-learning process that is used to discern signals from noise or, in Makris' case, movement patterns from random events.By averaging GPS data, Makris and his team outlined the movement patters of Dallas citizens during a typical week. They then compared normal movement patterns to those during and after the week of the winter storm to determine when Dallas started getting back to normal, or in mathematical terms, \"back to its initial equilibrium state.\"But why do these patterns translate from one city to another and from one type of natural hazard to another? Makris points out that even though we are the authors of our own actions, our group behavior as citizens of a city shows a great deal of determinism. \"Our collective future has a periodicity that is determined, and tomorrow is waiting patiently to become the next present, unless you have a natural hazard in which it is broken.\"Makris is planning to use his city-wide data to then conduct studies on the community-level to learn which communities are more or less resilient in the face of a natural disruption. This research will help city planners by providing a quantitative measure of where best to allocate resources to prepare for future natural hazards.

  "answer_squad": " Ocean carbon capture",
  "text": "Scientists around the world are racing to develop new methods for combating the rising levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere that are driving climate change and threatening the health of our planet.          Ocean carbon capture, which involves using natural ocean processes to trap and store greenhouse gases out at sea, is one promising method. Two L.A. researchers\u2014Will Berelson of USC and Jess Adkins of Caltech\u2014are looking to harness this technology to address the problem.\"Behind every potential solution for a more sustainable world lies a story of hard work and collaboration,\" USC President Carol L. Folt said. \"This promising research to reduce carbon emissions between USC and Caltech will help us all achieve a more sustainable future\u2014starting right here in Southern California.\"We met up with Berelson, professor of earth sciences, environmental studies and spatial sciences at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, and Adkins, the Smits Family Professor of Geochemistry and Global Environmental Science at Caltech, at the docks of AltaSea at the Port of Los Angeles\u2014one of the largest harbors in the world and a leading gateway for international trade in North America.How does the shipping industry play a role in climate change?Berelson: At seaports around the world, huge quantities of goods arrive daily that feed the global economy. Those goods are transported across the ocean on container ships, cargo ships and other vessels that burn diesel fuel. Collectively, all the ships in the world are contributing about 3% of the carbon dioxide that's being added to our atmosphere every year.Adkins: Over 90% of the products we use in our daily lives traveled on a ship at some point. If we're going to think about how to deal with our CO2 problem as a society, we have to be mindful of the fact that we can't electrify all parts of the industry. Shipping is a good example of an industry that doesn't electrify well. It's hard to imagine ships running off batteries, even though we must, as a society, get ourselves onto renewable energy.      How do carbon emissions affect our oceans?Berelson: As carbon dioxide from the atmosphere dissolves in ocean water, it increases its acidity thus causing ocean acidification. The rising annual rate of CO2 emissions leads to a corresponding increase in ocean acidification, resulting in dramatic impacts on marine ecosystems like corals and other organisms that use calcium carbonate to build shells.People care about corals for their beauty, but these organisms are also crucial to biodiversity and sustaining the populations of fish and other marine life that live in and among the coral communities.Adkins: Exactly. As you acidify the ocean, you make it harder for the main components of the ecosystem to grow. But another reason we should care about ocean acidification over and above the photographic megafauna that are corals is the algae out in the middle of the ocean and far away from the coast. They are the primary producers and bottom of the marine food chain where sunlight is first turned into organic matter and then becomes food for the rest of the system, humans included.Credit: University of Southern CaliforniaHow does the ocean naturally capture carbon?Adkins: The planet has been capturing carbon for billions of years. As the ocean absorbs excess carbon, the CO2 reacts with calcium carbonate, or limestone, that naturally occurs at the sea floor\u2014this reaction makes the neutral salts of bicarbonate and calcium ions.Berelson: The natural reaction that happens in the ocean is exactly what happens when you treat an upset stomach. The analogy we like to use is that when you have excess acid in your tummy, you take a little antacid tablet, which is effectively ground up calcium carbonate, to neutralize the acid.What are you working on now?Berelson: An idea came about during our research on how the ocean naturally mitigates excess CO2. We discovered that if we could accelerate the dissolution of limestone, it could be a way to mitigate CO2 at a larger scale. We're developing a startup company that could one day build machinery that would allow this reaction to happen at a fast enough scale and at the right quantity to make a greater impact on CO2 reduction.Adkins: Right. Although the ocean naturally captures carbon, it does so at a slow rate. We want to find ways of speeding up the neutralization of that extra CO2. All we have to do is follow the natural process of what happens when, say, volcanoes erupt and release CO2 into the atmosphere.What inspired this collaboration?Adkins: We've known each other for decades as friends in the field and have always talked about finding something to work on together. But it was our shared concern about ocean acidification and the idea that we might be able to make a breakthrough that brought us together to think about joining labs.Berelson: True, we initially bonded over our common interest in chemical oceanography. That and all things having to do with major league baseball.

Dramatic images of lava pouring from the volcano's smoking crater were published by the government-run Merapi Volcano Observatory.Dozens of small tremors related to Merapi's eruption were recorded on Tuesday, according to the Centre for Research and Development of Geological Disaster Technology (BPPTKG), a government agency that monitors the volcano.\"Merapi's activity slightly increased over the last few days... but these kinds of increases often occur in Merapi,\" said BPPTKG head Agus Budi Santoso.Clear weather meant people could easily see the eruption pouring from the volcano, he said.Merapi, which sits just 28 kilometers (17 miles) north of the provincial capital Yogyakarta, is closely monitored by the agency.Authorities implemented a restriction zone of seven kilometers (four miles) in 2022 following a risk assessment for the surrounding villages.Lava from Merapi's eruption on Tuesday fell well within that zone, Santoso said.Merapi's alert level, which has been kept at the second-highest mark since 2020 following increased volcanic activity, has remained unchanged, Santoso said.The volcano's last major eruption in 2010 killed more than 300 people and forced the evacuation of some 280,000 residents.It was Merapi's most powerful eruption since 1930, when about 1,300 people were killed.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Indonesia's Merapi volcano erupts, spewing 'avalanche' of lava (2023, May 23)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-indonesia-merapi-volcano-erupts-spewing.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the group that is researching cultivated meat?",
  "answer_squad": " UC Davis Cultivated Meat Consortium",
  "text": "Lab-grown meat, which is cultured from animal cells, is often thought to be more environmentally friendly than beef because it's predicted to need less land, water and greenhouse gases than raising cattle. But in a preprint, not yet peer-reviewed, researchers at the University of California, Davis, have found that lab-grown or \"cultivated\" meat's environmental impact is likely to be \"orders of magnitude\" higher than retail beef based on current and near-term production methods.          Researchers conducted a life-cycle assessment of the energy needed and greenhouse gases emitted in all stages of production and compared that with beef. One of the current challenges with lab-grown meat is the use of highly refined or purified growth media, the ingredients needed to help animal cells multiply. Currently, this method is similar to the biotechnology used to make pharmaceuticals. This sets up a critical question for cultured meat production: Is it a pharmaceutical product or a food product?\"If companies are having to purify growth media to pharmaceutical levels, it uses more resources, which then increases global warming potential,\" said lead author and doctoral graduate Derrick Risner, UC Davis Department of Food Science and Technology. \"If this product continues to be produced using the 'pharma' approach, it's going to be worse for the environment and more expensive than conventional beef production.\"The scientists defined the global warming potential as the carbon dioxide equivalents emitted for each kilogram of meat produced. The study found that the global warming potential of lab-based meat using these purified media is four to 25 times greater than the average for retail beef.A more climate friendly burger in the future?One of the goals of the industry is to eventually create lab-grown meat using primarily food-grade ingredients or cultures without the use of expensive and energy-intensive pharmaceutical grade ingredients and processes.Under that scenario, researchers found cultured meat is much more environmentally competitive, but with a wide range. Cultured meat's global warming potential could be between 80% lower to 26% above that of conventional beef production, they calculate. While these results are more promising, the leap from \"pharma to food\" still represents a significant technical challenge for system scale-up.\"Our findings suggest that cultured meat is not inherently better for the environment than conventional beef. It's not a panacea,\" said corresponding author Edward Spang, an associate professor in the Department of Food Science and Technology. \"It's possible we could reduce its environmental impact in the future, but it will require significant technical advancement to simultaneously increase the performance and decrease the cost of the cell culture media.\"Even the most efficient beef production systems reviewed in the study outperform cultured meat across all scenarios (both food and pharma), suggesting that investments to advance more climate-friendly beef production may yield greater reductions in emissions more quickly than investments in cultured meat.Developing the technology that would allow the leap from \"pharma to food\" is among the goals of the UC Davis Cultivated Meat Consortium, a cross-disciplinary group of scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs and educators researching cultivated meat. Other goals are to establish and evaluate cell lines that could be used to grow meat and find ways to create more structure in cultured meat.Risner said even if lab-based meat doesn't result in a more climate-friendly burger, there is still valuable science to be learned from the endeavor.\"It may not lead to environmentally friendly commodity meat, but it could lead to less expensive pharmaceuticals, for example,\" said Risner. \"My concern would just be scaling this up too quickly and doing something harmful for the environment.\"The study is published on the bioRxiv preprint server.

The paper, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is entitled \"The Montreal Protocol is delaying the occurrence of the first ice-free Arctic summer.\"          The Montreal Protocol\u2014the first treaty to be ratified by every United Nations country\u2014regulates nearly 100 man-made chemicals called ozone-depleting substances (ODSs).While the main aim was to preserve the ozone layer, ODSs are also potent greenhouse gases, so the deal has slowed global warming.The new study shows the effects of this include delaying the first ice-free Arctic summer (currently projected to happen the middle of this century) by up to 15 years, depending on future emissions.The researchers\u2014from UC Santa Cruz, Columbia University and the University of Exeter\u2014estimate that each 1,000 metric tons of ODS emissions prevented saves about seven square kilometers of Arctic sea ice.\"While ODSs aren't as abundant as other greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, they can have a real impact on global warming,\" said Dr. Mark England, Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 senior research fellow at the University of Exeter.\"ODSs have particularly powerful effects in the Arctic, and they played a major role in driving Arctic climate change in the second half of the 20th century. While stopping these effects was not the primary goal of the Montreal Protocol, it has been a fantastic by-product.\"Dr. England said opponents of the protocol predicted a range of negative consequences, most of which did not happen, and instead there are numerous documented instances of unintended climate benefits.Professor Lorenzo Polvani, from Columbia University, said, \"The first ice-free Arctic summer\u2014meaning the Arctic Ocean practically free of sea ice\u2014will be a major milestone in the process of climate change.\"Our findings clearly demonstrate that the Montreal Protocol has been a very powerful climate protection treaty, and has done much more than healing the ozone hole over the South Pole. Its effects are being felt all over the world, especially in the Arctic.\"ODS decline The study, which used new climate model simulations, shows that protection of the ozone layer itself played no part in slowing the loss of Arctic sea ice\u2014all the benefits relate to the role of ODSs as greenhouse gases.ODSs (which include chlorofluorocarbons, also called CFCs) are compounds developed in the last century for industrial use as refrigerants and propellants.The Montreal Protocol, which has now been signed by all 198 members of United Nations, regulated these compounds to preserve the ozone layer, which protects humans and the environment from harmful levels of ultraviolet radiation.This effort has succeeded, with atmospheric concentrations of ODSs declining since the mid-1990s and signs that the ozone layer has started to heal.However, research has suggested a slight rise in ODS concentrations from 2010\u201320, so Dr. England said vigilance is still required.

  "text": "Every few years, changes in how the ocean and atmosphere interact along the West Coast\u2014stretching from southern California to Peru and reaching across the Pacific almost to Fiji and the Solomon Islands\u2014determine climate variability around the globe. To better predict this El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), an international research team applied artificial intelligence (AI) to develop a model capable of forecasting up to 22 months of this phenomenon.          They published their approach on May 17 in Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Research.\"ENSO dominates Earth's year-to-year climate variability and can often cause severe environmental and socioeconomic impacts globally,\" said first author Haoyu Wang, a doctoral student in the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Oceanology's Key Laboratory of Ocean Circulation and Waves. \"However, despite continuous ENSO theory and modeling advances, the global heat signature variations preceding ENSO events have not been fully understood, especially for long-lead ENSO forecasts more than 12 months in advance.\"This outer prediction of a year is partly limited by what the researchers call a spring persistence barrier, referring to the variability of the spring season as it transitions from the freeze of winter to the steam of summer. As temperatures shift at both the sea surface and in the atmosphere, the data becomes muddy and provides a more garbled indication of what might be expected from the ENSO.\"In this paper, we used AI methods to predict the ENSO phenomenon, achieving an effective prediction length of 22 months for Ni\u00f1o 3.4 and minimal influence from spring prediction barriers,\" said corresponding author Xiaofeng Li, professor in the Key Laboratory of Ocean Circulation and Waves. Ni\u00f1o 3.4 refers to the middle of the southern Pacific Ocean, halfway between the ENSO's outer borders. It is one of four Ni\u00f1o indices.\"Additionally, we designed an interpretable method to observe the relationship between global sea surface temperature and ocean heat content with ENSO from an AI perspective.\"They named their approach the Spatio-Temporal Information Extraction and Fusion (STIEF) model and trained it on historic observations of surface sea temperatures and simulated ocean heat content data. According to Li, it contains two key components: the ability to extract space and time features and the ability to fuse those features together.The deep learning model extracts the temporal and spatial ocean data characteristics in parallel. It then uses what it learns from those separate data points to understand how they correlate based only on the immediate past data points. This allows the model to avoid the pitfall of assuming a future data point is the result of a gradual lead up, compensating for the rapidly shifting changes of spring persistence barriers.According to Wang, the team also designed the model to retroactively understand how it processed various data points to make predictions. Typically, the processing is too tangled to extract specific data and follow how the model used it in its forecast. Called the 'black box' issue, researchers can see the input variables and the output forecast, but the process remains a mystery.\"We designed an interpretable approach to solve the 'black box' issue in our AI-based ENSO prediction model,\" Wang said. \"This allows us to observe the correlations between different variables from the perspective of AI, providing new insights for our ocean forecast phenomena theoretical research.\"The researchers said they plan to continue improving their model and eventually apply it to all four Ni\u00f1o indices to explore ENSO diversity. The eventual goal is to establish an interpretable AI model that is applicable to various ocean phenomena forecasts.

  "answer_squad": " Kern River Intertie",
  "text": "The Kern River is swollen with so much runoff from the epic Sierra Nevada snowpack that state water officials have decided to open a rarely used relief valve, diverting floodwaters into the California Aqueduct to be used as drinking water in Southern California.          Opening this flow relief valve, known as the Kern River Intertie, is intended to prevent floodwaters from reaching Tulare Lake, which in recent weeks has reemerged, replenished by powerful winter storms and now heavy spring runoff. In the early 20th century, the lake was systematically drained and channeled, allowing farmers to transform this arid swath of the San Joaquin Valley into a center of industrial agriculture.Now, the phantom lake's reappearance has swallowed thousands of acres of farmland and is encroaching on low-lying towns such as Corcoran.It marks the first time since 2006 that the intertie, which connects the Kern to the aqueduct west of Bakersfield, has been activated. The gates of the 320-foot-long channel were to be opened Saturday to begin taking in floodwater.Karla Nemeth, director of the state Department of Water Resources, stressed the move is not a response to an \"immediate public safety issue\" to residents. The overall goal, she said, is to \"do what we can to limit the amount of water that ends up in the lakebed.\"\"The less water up against the Corcoran levee, the better,\" she said.The intertie functions like a gated alley connecting two much larger streets. On one side lies a stretch of the Kern River called the Buena Vista Channel, and on the other is the California Aqueduct, a simple name for a complex system of tunnels and pipelines that transports water from Northern California and the Sierra to the state's arid central and southern expanses.To open the connection, operators lower the aqueduct's water level below the level of the intertie basin. When the gates separating the two are opened, gravity conducts the Kern River water into the aqueduct. The flow is expected to start at a rate of 500 cubic feet per second and will increase to 1,000 cubic feet per second later this month.Over two months, state officials said, about 75,000 acre-feet of Kern River water will pass into the aqueduct, enough to supply approximately 225,000 homes for a year.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the connection to the aqueduct in 1977 to reduce flood risks for communities around the Tulare Lake Basin by redirecting flows when the Kern River runs fast and high. Dam managers have been releasing unusually high flows from Lake Isabella in the southern Sierra, where the Kern is dammed, to create room for the historic snowmelt. That, in turn, has fueled the Kern, and water managers said they determined that without intervention, the flows would follow the river channel and pour into Tulare Lake.      \"That's why the intertie was designed, authorized and built, was to control just this kind of a flood situation,\" said Mark Mulkay, the Kern River watermaster, who asked the state to activate the facility.Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an executive order this week facilitating the water diversions as part of emergency flood response efforts. Local irrigation districts are already diverting as much water as they can handle to supply crops and fill groundwater recharge facilities.\"Everything is full. All of our irrigation demands are being met,\" Mulkay said. \"We've offered water to everybody, and we think we've done a pretty good job of making sure that all of the recharge ponds are full. So this is, in fact, water over and above what can be managed here in Kern County without causing flood damages.\"The only place left to send the water safely is via the aqueduct to the cities of Southern California, where the Metropolitan Water District will mix it with other flows from Northern California, treat the water and send it to taps.Snowpack in the southern Sierra stands at more than 400% of average for this time of year, meaning unusually high runoffs could continue for months. But Nemeth said the peak snowmelt for the Kern watershed will play out \"within the next week or two.\"In addition to dealing with the enormous snowpack, local water officials have been struggling to develop plans for combating chronic overpumping of groundwater, which has left some residents with dry wells and caused the land to sink several feet in parts of the Tulare Lake Basin.State regulators have declared local groundwater management plans inadequate in six areas of the San Joaquin Valley, including the Kern and Tulare Lake subbasins.With more water flowing in the Kern River than the area can handle, the situation underscores the region's unrealized potential for aquifer recharge, Nemeth said. Local agencies need to get infrastructure in place that enables them to preserve more of the bounty the next time California gets a wet year, she said.\"When we look to the future, we want to be using the intertie less and less frequently, so that local communities and the groundwater sustainability agencies can capture those flood flows and recharge their groundwater basins,\" Nemeth said. \"That is the future.\"    2023 Los Angeles Times.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "text": "As energy companies shift away from burning coal to generate electricity, many are leaving behind toxic waste that could endanger public health and the environment for years to come.          New regulations proposed by the Biden administration would expand the number of coal ash dumps subject to federal oversight, a change intended to prevent spills that during the past decade wreaked havoc near power plants in North Carolina and Tennessee.One of the sites that would come under federal oversight is the Waukegan Generating Station on Lake Michigan, a former ComEd coal plant ringed by two unlined ash ponds and an unlicensed landfill. Another is a Joliet quarry where ComEd and other companies dumped coal ash until NRG Energy overhauled a nearby coal plant in 2016 to burn natural gas.Ten Illinois ash dumps pose a danger to the drinking water supplies of nearby communities, including the Joliet site and ash pits surrounding another NRG coal plant along the Des Plaines River in Romeoville. Another site that threatens Lake Michigan is a coal plant in Michigan City, Indiana, owned by the Northern Indiana Public Service Co., which has planned to excavate and safely dispose of only half of its waste.EPA Administrator Michael Regan noted that many of the leaking ash dumps are in or near low-income, predominantly Black or Latino communities.\"We are hopeful this rule will hold these industries accountable and send a message that community members and taxpayers will no longer be responsible to clean up their mess,\" said Dulce Ortiz, co-chair of the Waukegan-based group Clean Power Lake County. \"We all deserve healthy communities and environments that our families and future generations can enjoy.\"The Biden proposal, unveiled this week by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, would replace Obama-era rules thrown out by a federal court and even weaker standards adopted during the Trump administration.If the latest version survives political and legal challenges, it would require more protective measures from companies in Republican-controlled states such as Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia. It also would add the prospect of federal enforcement in Illinois and other states that in recent years adopted regulations intended to force the clean up of largely unlined dumps leaching pollution into lakes and rivers.      Despite well-documented dangers, dumps surrounding about 250 coal plants are regulated far more loosely than household garbage landfills. Environmental groups that sued the EPA demanding tougher rules welcomed the Biden administration's proposal as a major step forward but noted it would still exempt some coal ash dumps from federal oversight.\"The EPA is taking significant steps to address a massive loophole that let many coal plant owners off the hook from cleaning up the toxic mess they created,\" said Lisa Evans, senior counsel at the nonprofit Earthjustice legal organization. \"Power plants will finally lose their hall pass to leave coal ash wherever they dumped it.\"It took a federal court order to nudge the EPA to submit a new version of the regulations. Under the proposal, energy companies would be required to monitor their ash dumps and, in many cases, clean them up.Most of the waste in Illinois has been mixed with water and pumped into unlined pits, where testing shows harmful levels of arsenic, chromium, lead and other heavy metals are steadily oozing through the ground toward lakes and rivers, including the Middle Fork of the Vermilion River, the state's only national scenic river.After decades of scant oversight, Illinois in 2021 adopted its own regulations that require coal ash dumps to be sealed or excavated.\"It appears our rules are just as strong, if not stronger\" than the Biden EPA's proposal, said Andrew Rehn, senior water resources engineer at the Champaign-based Prairie Rivers Network, one of the nonprofit groups that has been pushing for years to clean up the pollution.Clout-heavy utilities and coal companies blocked several attempts during the 1990s and 2000s to classify coal ash as hazardous waste. Energy companies further delayed action by challenging regulations adopted by the Obama administration in 2015 and persuading the Trump administration to propose a weaker alternative in 2020.Regan, who led North Carolina's environmental agency before joining the Biden administration, helped broker a multibillion-dollar settlement with Duke Energy after major spills of coal ash from two of the company's power plants.Earthen berms are the only thing holding back coal ash at many of the sites nationwide. In 2008, 5.4 million cubic yards of waste poured into rivers near the Tennessee Valley Authority's Kingston Fossil Plant after a dike failed. The disaster prompted Earthjustice and other groups to call for the removal of coal ash from every other site, something that could finally start happening if the new federal regulations are adopted.    2023 Chicago Tribune.

  "text": "The French government unveiled a plan on Monday to accelerate cuts to its greenhouse gas emissions, targeting a reduction of 50 percent by 2030 compared with 1990 levels.          Unveiled by Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne, the roadmap includes detailed figures for reductions for individual sectors of the economy, ranging from the transport industry to households.The objectives\u2014from speeding up the transition to electric cars or switching freight from road to rivers\u2014are aimed at bringing France's ambitions for slashing carbon pollution into line with the EU's target for 2030.France has so far cut its emissions by 25 percent compared with 1990 levels, requiring major fresh efforts if it is to hit the new 50-percent target.The centrist government of President Emmanuel Macron is wary of provoking consumers with costly initiatives, with memories still fresh of an increase in fuel taxes and vehicle emissions restrictions in 2018 which sparked major protests.The so-called \"Yellow Vest\" revolt against Macron began in small and medium-sized towns and the countryside where locals felt they were being penalized for using their cars when no other forms of transport were available.\"We're asking for a bit from the smallest (polluters) and a lot from the biggest,\" an aide to Borne told reporters, meaning around half of efforts would be for companies, a quarter for households and a quarter for local administrations.Concern about climate change has leapt up the political agenda in the last 12 months, with the country experiencing its hottest year since records began last year which left rivers dry, crops withered and widespread water shortages.A record nation-wide winter drought during January and February has also led to fears about water supplies this summer.Macron, who has admitted to grasping the scale of the planet's environmental problems late, promised to put climate change at the heart of his second term in office which began in May last year.He pledged to make France the first major nation to abandon fossil fuels and gave Borne an extra job title for \"planning the ecological transition.\"But the 45-year-old former investment banker has been derided by environmental groups and Greens lawmakers for going too slow and he sparked criticism on May 11 by calling for a \"pause\" on EU environmental legislation.Among other developed countries, the United Kingdom has the most ambitious short-term goals of any major economy, with an objective of 2030 emissions being 68 percent below 1990 levels.The United States has committed to cut greenhouse gases 50-52 percent by 2030 below 2005 levels, while Germany has set a 65 percent reduction target compared to 1990.The UN's climate science panel has said the world must slash emissions 43 percent this decade to keep within the Paris Agreement's 1.5C global warming limit.China and India have set long-term goals to become carbon neutral by 2060 and 2070 respectively, but do not have emissions reduction targets for 2030.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:France unveils new, more ambitious emissions-cutting plan (2023, May 22)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-france-unveils-ambitious-emissions-cutting.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Western US states said Monday they have reached an agreement to cut the amount of water they take from the dwindling Colorado River, which is threatened by a quarter of a century of drought and worsening climate conditions.          The plan comes after years of bitter wrangling, with states refusing to give ground even as the water course has reached crisis point, threatening drinking water supplies for 40 million people and imperiling electricity generation across the American West.Under the proposal, the federal government will pay a reported $1.2 billion to water districts, Native American Tribes and cities in California, Nevada and Arizona to use less water over the next three years.The states themselves will also cut their use, though they will not be compensated.The reductions will reduce the amount of water taken from the once-mighty Colorado by 3 million acre-feet, or about 13 percent of all the water it supplies.An acre-foot refers to an acre covered in water a foot deep\u2014around 326,000 gallons (1.23 million liters) or about half an Olympic-size swimming pool.\"The entire Western United States is on the frontlines of climate change\u2014we must work together to address this crisis and the weather extremes between drought and flood,\" California Governor Gavin Newsom said in a release welcoming the agreement.\"California has stepped up to make significant cuts to water usage and now, this historic partnership between California and other Lower Basin states will help maintain critical water supply for millions of Americans as we work together to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Colorado River System for decades to come.\"President Joe Biden hailed the agreement as \"an important step forward in our efforts to protect the stability of the Colorado River System in the face of climate change and historic drought conditions.\"DeadpoolThe Colorado River runs through seven US states and Mexico, supplying drinking water and hydropower, and irrigating some of the country's most fertile farmland.But what was one of the world's great rivers has now shrunk.Human-caused climate change means the once-bountiful snowpack that feeds the river has dwindled.What snow there is melts more quickly because of higher temperatures, and more is lost to evaporation.Use of the river water is subject to a more than century-old agreement, made when it rained more and fewer people depended on the waterway.      But the agreement was always something of a fiddle\u2014a politically expedient fix that allowed users to take more water than was added every year.For years the states and the federal government have been deadlocked on how to square this circle and equitably divvy up the shrinking supply, even as the region has become more arid and river levels have dropped.Last year Lake Powell and Lake Mead\u2014two of the largest reservoirs in the country\u2014fell to historic lows, with fears that they might even drop below intake pipes at the Hoover Dam, a situation known as \"deadpool,\" which would halt hydro-electric production and stop the river flowing.The Bureau of Reclamation, the federal government department that manages water resources, threatened last month to impose mandatory cuts that would see Arizona, California and Nevada hit with a uniform percentage reduction.That proposal angered farmers in the south of California who take the lion's share of the state's allocation, an amount equivalent to everything extracted by Arizona and Nevada combined.Details on the proposal announced Monday were scant.The federal money will come from the Inflation Reduction Act, a piece of mega-legislation crafted by Biden's administration that provides huge sums of money for environmental initiatives.That cash will be used to pay users to take around 2.3 million acre-feet less of water.The remaining 700,000 acre-feet to be saved will come from the states, but exactly how that reduction will be achieved\u2014and who will bear the biggest burden\u2014was not immediately clear.The proposal runs through 2026, and does not include any reduction in use by Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, which also take water from the river.Scientists say a wet winter in the US west has alleviated some pressure on the system, but this is only a temporary reprieve as human-caused climate change continues to exacerbate a long-term drying trend in the region.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:US states reach agreement to save dwindling Colorado River (2023, May 22)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-breakthrough-colorado-river-big-years.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Using an aeronautic remote sensing system, Chinese scientists have obtained effective mountain glacier data during an ongoing airborne-ground science experiment on detecting the condition of Bayi Glacier in Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, northwest China's Qinghai Province, according to the Aerospace Information Research Institute (AIR), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).          It is the first time worldwide that a combined P-band, L-band, and VHF-band radar glacier detection experiment was conducted based on an airborne platform.The experiment was jointly conducted by the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, the Aerospace Information Research Institute, the Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, and the Innovation Academy for Precision Measurement Science and Technology, all of which are affiliated with CAS, and Wuhan University.It started on March 20 and is scheduled to end in mid-May. So far, a total of 11 flights have been conducted by the aerial remote sensing system, including seven flights for P/L-band tomographic and interferometric imaging and four flights for VHF-band fluoroscopic imaging, and 4.6 TB of valid data have been acquired.The researchers conducted simultaneous optical and LiDAR observations of the ice surface, as well as onboard instrument calibration of the ice surface, ground-penetrating radar glacier thickness measurement, and ultra-long-range 3D laser point cloud imaging.Preliminary data analysis showed that the 3D reconstruction results of P-band and L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images could reflect the changing trend of glacier surface elevation, which is basically consistent with the results of airborne 3D LiDAR and ground survey.                The experimental team used ground-penetrating radar to survey glacier thickness. Credit: AIR             The VHF data provided a clear glacier profile, which could clearly reflect the interface line of atmosphere, ice surface, and bedrock, as well as the artificially placed electrical anomalies located at 80-m depth of the ice core borehole. The depth of the profile interpretation was basically consistent with the ground-sounding results.The preliminary results showed that the experiment had validated the comprehensive observation technique of glacier characteristics, obtained valid data, and verified the feasibility of the P/L/VHF bands joint experiment.In the future, the data obtained from the experiment will be further opened and shared in the National Tibetan Plateau Science Data Center to promote further development of remote sensing inversion methods for glacier thickness and internal structure.      Prof. Wu Yirong, director-general of AIR, noted that the VHF band airborne radar onboard is China's first domestic aerial glacier detection payload independently developed by AIR. \"It is also the first time a domestic remote sensing aircraft has flown above 4,500 meters in the mountain region.\"This experiment showcased the capability of using aerial remote sensing to monitor glacier thickness and estimate ice reserve, marking the development of the next-generation cryosphere remote sensing technology.The aeronautic remote sensing system, hosted by AIR, was officially put into operation in July 2021. Featuring the most comprehensive aerial remote sensing platform and scientific experiment platform in China, it has undertaken various scientific research tasks such as large-scale aviation remote sensing comprehensive scientific experiments, new remote sensing payload calibration, and disaster and environmental monitoring, and obtained a large number of valuable scientific data.

  "text": "Europe's coasts are densely populated and already affected by the impacts of sea level rise. In addition to traditional, cost-intensive coastal protection measures, spatial land use planning strategies are becoming increasingly important to protect coastal communities from damage during high tides or storm surges. Such planning tools include managed retreat or even the establishment of so-called \"setback zones,\" coastal areas where further development is restricted.          A research team from Kiel University has carried out the first Europe-wide modeling study of the effectiveness of different types of setback zones in reducing future urban exposure. According to the study, in most EU countries, the establishment of the most effective setback zones could result in new urban development being at least 50 percent less vulnerable to rising sea levels and associated hazards by the year 2100. The researchers recently published the results in Scientific Reports.\"Our modeling study is the first of its kind and can help to develop appropriate adaptation measures to protect cities and urban areas along Europe's coasts,\" says first author Dr. Claudia Wolff, a postdoctoral researcher in the Coastal Risks and Sea Level Rise group at the Institute of Geography in the priority research area Kiel Marine Science (KMS) at Kiel University.The results show that the future exposure of coastal cities to sea level will largely depend on how urban space in EU coastal areas is planned, designed and developed.\"The development of coastal setback zones should consider not only the distance from the coast, but also the elevation of the terrain above sea level.To our knowledge this aspect is currently not being discussed at the European level. We believe by taking this into account, cities and coastal areas can be better protected from the potential risks of rising sea levels in the future,\" says Wolff.Urban development modeled for all EU coastal member states on a country-specific basisAs part of their modeling study, the researchers developed various scenarios to project the urban extent of the low-lying coastal zone below 20 meters above sea level (known as the Extended Low-Elevation Coastal Zone, E-LECZ). This area covers 6.3 percent of the EU coastal states, where 15.1 percent of the urbanized area is currently located.In addition to the physical component of how coastal areas are changing due to sea level rise, the research team looked specifically at socio-economic factors, including different types of setback zones. In doing so, they investigated how urban areas might change as a result of higher urban development, and how the exposure to rising sea levels might change in Europe in the future.The scientists modeled country-specific urban development for all EU coastal member states. To do this, the researchers first used an artificial neural network to predict the urban development potential for each country based on parameters such as elevation, population density or distance from the road network.They then calculated the future demand for urban land, taking into account various socio-economic factors, and created spatially explicit urban extent projections with a resolution of 100 meters. Various setback zones were integrated into these projections to analyze the effectiveness of such spatial planning tools in the face of rising sea levels.Further research is needed on a local levelSetback zones are particularly interesting for countries and regions with long coastlines. According to Wolff, not every stretch of coastline can be protected.More local and detailed studies are needed in the future for concrete planning and decisions. Professor Athanasios Vafeidis, co-author of the study and head of the Coastal Risks and Sea Level Rise research group at Kiel University, is conducting research on this in the EU Horizon 2020 project \"Coastal Climate Core Services\" (CoCliCo).\"The project aims to better inform decision-makers about adaptation measures for coastal protection and sea level rise,\" says Vafeidis. As a tool, the CoCliCo project envisions an integrative data service in the form of a pan-European, open and web-based platform that can be used by governments, NGOs, cities, industries, insurance companies or private individuals to inform about and exploit current and future threats from sea level rise.

  "text": "Cost-saving measures are key in today's economic climate. But they can also have a positive impact on minimizing your environmental footprint. A prime example is maintaining your cars' optimal tire pressure.          Over time, tires naturally lose pressure\u2014typically by around 1 psi a month. As pressure decreases, the tire becomes flatter, causing increased friction between the road and the tire itself. This heightened friction results in greater drag, reducing the lifespan of your tire and meaning more fuel is needed for travel.But driving with flatter tires also increases the number of tire wear particles that are released into the environment. These particles\u2014less than a millimeter in size\u2014have been classified as microplastics due to their chemical makeup.Tire wear stands out as a major source of microplastic pollution. Globally, each person is responsible for around 1kg of microplastic pollution from tire wear released into the environment on average each year\u2014with even higher rates observed in developed nations.It is estimated that between 8% and 40% of these particles find their way into surface waters such as the sea, rivers and lakes through runoff from road surfaces, wastewater discharge or even through airborne transport.However, tire wear microplastics have been largely overlooked as a microplastic pollutant. Their dark color makes them difficult to detect, so these particles can't be identified using the traditional spectroscopy methods used to identify other more colorful plastic polymers.To understand the extent of tire wear pollution, scientists have instead had to figure out ways to identify the chemicals that are associated with tires in water samples. Using these methods, tire wear chemicals have been found in 97% of river and estuary samples tested in Europe, the US and Japan.And yet, we still know relatively little about the effects of tire wear pollutants on the health of marine animals. This is what my colleagues and I set out to discover in a recent study.      Filter feedersOur study focused on two species common to estuaries in the north-east Atlantic\u2014a bivalve called the peppery furrow shell and the ragworm. The bivalve feeds by filtering organic particles from the water and sediment.The worm is primarily carnivorous, eating small creatures that live on the seafloor, but it also obtains some of its food from seawater and sediment. Both animals are likely to be exposed to tire wear particles and the potential toxins they contain.We carried out two experiments. In the first, we exposed these animals to high concentrations of tire particles (10%) mixed into the sediment they burrow in for three days to see whether they ingested them. We then dissected the animals and counted any tire particles within their gastrointestinal tract.Because the tire particles are rubbery, and could be compressed with a needle, we were able to analyze them under a microscope. We found that the worms only consumed small concentrations of tire particles (at most 33).By contrast, the bivalves had large quantities of both sediment and tire particles in their stomachs\u2014one bivalve had consumed over 1,000 tire particles.In the second experiment, we exposed the animals to three concentrations of tire particles (0.2%, 1% and 5%) mixed into the sediment for three weeks. We did this to understand how this exposure affected their health.We measured a number of health indicators, ranging from cellular to organism level. Bivalve health was affected at all of the concentrations tested, with feeding and burrowing impaired even at low concentrations (0.2%). At a high concentration (5%), we observed a decrease in protein content and an increase in oxidative stress.Oxidative stress occurs when there are too many unstable molecules called free radicals in the body. These free radicals can lead to cell and tissue damage.At low concentrations, the health of the worm was not affected. But we did observe a decrease in protein and energy content and signs of oxidative stress as exposure to tire wear particles increased.Should we be concerned?Concentrations of tire wear particles as high as 5% are unlikely in the natural environment. But our results are still worrying, particularly as the time in which the animals were exposed to the particles was short. The observed decrease in bivalve feeding and burrowing at low concentrations suggests exposure to tire wear microplastics in the wild will significantly impact this species.Any decline in the health of these species could have a knock on effect on the wider marine ecosystem. Burrowing animals, like the bivalve, play crucial roles in recycling nutrients and enhancing photosynthesis. They are also an important food source for larger animals including birds, fish and crabs.There is evidence that some of the chemicals that leach from these particles are toxic to marine animals. Research shows that they can reduce phytoplankton growth and harm the health of mussels.The chemical make-up of tires varies depending on brand and car model\u2014subsequently, toxicity will vary too. In the future, the complex mixture of components that go into the production of tires must be risk assessed more rigorously.The chemicals that are found to have a negative impact on human and environmental health should then be substituted or removed, thereby reducing the impact of these microplastics in the environment.Until then, there are several simple things you can do to help. These include maintaining the correct tire pressure, avoiding sharp braking or acceleration and reducing your vehicle load. All of these will reduce the amount of microplastics that your car releases into the environment.

  "text": "In July 2021, central China's Henan Province experienced an extraordinary event\u2014a prolonged heavy rainfall period marked by record-breaking hourly rain rates and substantial precipitation accumulation.          The event took place in an anomalous synoptic circulation pattern: the coexistence of a northwestward-shifting western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and Typhoon In-Fa (2021) over the East China Sea. However, few studies have focused on the synergistic effect of the WPSH and Typhoon In-Fa on this particular heavy rainfall.A research team led by Prof. Chen Guanghua from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has revealed the physical mechanism responsible for this heavy rainfall event in the summer of 2021 by conducting a series of numerical simulations.Their findings were published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres.The researchers found that this rainfall event unfolded under the highly favorable WPSH and Typhoon In-Fa circulations and their cooperation. \"Notably, the contribution of Typhoon In-Fa is greater in amplifying the rainfall compared to the WPSH,\" said Prof. Chen, corresponding author of the study.Additionally, the study identified the critical role played by the expansive and strong nature of the WPSH and Typhoon In-Fa in enhancing the northward and westward moisture transports, respectively. Conversely, weakening of these systems led to a decrease in moisture transport. Moreover, the distribution of equivalent potential temperature and divergence were closely linked to the region of heavy rainfall.Prof. Chen also emphasized the importance of further exploration in this field. \"This study serves as a preliminary endeavor to comprehend the synergistic effects of weather systems on heavy rainfall. Ongoing research aims to delve into the interactions among multi-scale systems.\"As climate change continues to escalate, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are anticipated to rise. Understanding the factors driving these events is important in enhancing preparedness and mitigating their impact.

  "text": "Methane\u2014a potent greenhouse gas and the second biggest driver of global warming after carbon dioxide (CO\u2082)\u2014had its moment in the spotlight in 2021. Over 100 countries signed on to the Global Methane Pledge to cut emissions by 30% compared to 2020 levels by 2030.          This is a useful goal, but our new research shows that something is still missing: stringent policies to eliminate methane emissions.Our study is the first global review of methane policies which have been adopted across the world since the 1970s. It reveals that only around 13% of man-made methane emissions from the biggest sources (agriculture, energy and waste) is regulated by policies capable of controlling and preventing them.This falls to 10% if we take a conservative view of the total emissions and regions covered by specific policies and whether they have been fully or partially implemented.These policies may mandate companies to find and fix methane leaks, install equipment which can capture emissions, charge them for every unit of methane released or reward them for making use of methane, like extracting biogas from rotting food and other organic waste. Our study showed that the majority (70%) of policies have been adopted in the US and Europe.Methane is over 80 times more powerful in trapping heat in Earth's atmosphere than CO\u2082 but lasts for a much shorter time. Since methane in the air breaks down within about a decade (compared to centuries for CO\u2082), phasing out emissions could rapidly reduce the rate at which the planet is heating.For any hope of meeting global climate targets, deep methane reductions are needed immediately. Our research shows that countries which have committed to deep cuts must now expand and strengthen policies for eliminating their emissions. The remaining countries should step up their efforts on methane too.Regulation varies by sectorWe systematically examined policies which have been introduced in 79 countries to reduce methane emissions across farming, solid and liquid waste management and the energy sectors (including the extraction, transportation and consumption of fossil fuels\u2014coal, oil and gas).Motivations for regulating methane varied. Not only does the gas contribute to climate change, but it can also generate tropospheric ozone\u2014a harmful air pollutant. Methane is also a safety hazard if its concentration in the air reaches an explosive range (5-15%).But if it is captured, methane becomes a source of energy as the major component of natural gas. And so regulating methane, for example by incentivizing the capture of methane from coalbeds, can be cheap and useful.How effective such policies have been is far from clear though, as countries do not tend to quantify their emissions using direct measurements.Regulations are more frequently used to address fossil (oil, gas and coal) rather than biogenic (livestock, solid and liquid waste) sources of methane. In fact, 41% of all policies targeted methane from coal mines and oil refineries, compared with 25% for farms and landfills.Taxes and charges, on the quantities of waste for example, are more common for regulating biogenic sources whereas financial incentives, like feed-in tariffs for electricity generated from captured coal mine methane, are more frequently used in fossil methane policies.Policies targeting methane emissions from the oil and gas sector tend to be more stringent than those targeting coal mines. Similarly, policies targeting methane emissions from solid and liquid waste are more stringent than those addressing livestock emissions.These divergent approaches to regulating different methane sources may be the result of opposition from the fossil fuel and agricultural industries. The relative importance of these industries to national and regional economies and energy and food supply may also explain why government regulation has so far proved inadequate.      Where regulation must improveMore stringent policies and a consistent approach for quantifying how much methane is being emitted from each source will be key to bringing regulation in line with global commitments.Improving the monitoring of methane emissions is particularly important for enabling deeper cuts. Historically, methane emissions have been difficult and costly to measure, partly because it is an invisible gas and compared to CO\u2082, only minor emissions cause substantial warming.However, methane reduction is still often perceived by policymakers as a choice rather than a necessary complement to ongoing decarbonization efforts focused on CO\u2082.Within almost every sector there are major methane sources that have been largely overlooked. These include the digestive gases of cows and other livestock, methane from the ventilation shafts of coal mines, high-emitting sources in the oil and gas sector (so called super-emitters), and from abandoned mines and oil and gas wells.In the energy sector, emissions from non-operated joint ventures are particularly neglected by regulation. This is a type of business structure where a company owns an equity interest without assuming day-to-day operational control.These are usually owned by major oil and gas companies, but operated by local partners\u2014national oil and gas firms in developing countries are a prime example. Supply chains are another important source, particularly with internationally-traded commodities like liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coking coal used in steelmaking.In the oil and gas sector, where methane may be more cost-effective to reduce because the captured gas could be monetised, global commitments like the Paris Agreement require the industry's own emissions to fall alongside falling demand for fossil fuels across all economies.As Dr. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, recently put it, the next UN climate change conference (COP28) in the United Arab Emirates will be \"a moment of truth\" for both oil- and gas-rich countries and the industries exploiting these climate-damaging fuels.

  "text": "The end-Permian mass extinction (EPME) that occurred \uff5e252 million years ago was the most severe extinction event of the Phanerozoic, devastating both marine and terrestrial ecosystems, with the loss of \uff5e81% and \uff5e89% marine and terrestrial species, respectively.          Recently, a joint research group from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NIGAPS), Nanjing University and Yunnan University has confirmed large-scale high-temperature wildfire combustion events through high-precision organic geochemical analysis of biomarker compounds polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which provides insights into the collapse of terrestrial ecosystems and the changeover of vegetation during the Permian-Triassic (P-T) transition period.The results were published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters.Intensive volcanic activities around the Siberian Traps large igneous province and large-scale continental arc have triggered massive release of greenhouse and poisonous gases, global warming, aridification and frequent wildfires. The abundance of PAHs, which can be important indicators for incomplete combustion of organic matter formed at higher temperatures caused by wildfires, is a well-known alternative for investigating wildfire activities in geological history.Most of the previous research on PAHs focused on marine records during the P-T transition period, and research on terrestrial records were relatively insufficient.This study focused on the high-resolution PAHs in a non-marine P-T transitional sequence from the HK-1 drill core at the Lengqinggou section in Southwest China. The PAHs content showed consistent significant enrichment during the P-T transitional period, which was coupled with negative organic carbon isotope anomalies, revealing that there were large-scale high-temperature wildfire combustion events under the high-temperature and arid paleoclimate conditions during this period.Additionally, low-molecular-weight compounds such as Dibenzofuran (DBF) were mainly derived from the biodegradation of terrestrial plant polysaccharides and lignin. In the HK-1 drill core, the abnormally high concentration of DBF compounds and the co-variation with the combustion-derived PAHs indicated that the PAHs were mainly derived from high-temperature wildfire combustion of terrestrial plants and the tropical rainforest vegetation systems provided sufficient fuel for large-scale wildfires during P-T transition.The low PAH contents in the Lower Triassic indicated a fuel shortage after the mass deforestation. The significantly changed PAH ratios showed that the terrestrial ecosystem was greatly affected after the EPME.These PAH records suggested the vegetation type changed from a dense and highly diverse gigantopterid-dominated tropical rainforest ecosystem to an isoetalean-dominated herbaceous heathland-like ecosystem.

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the term for the process of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere?",
  "answer_squad": " reforestation",
  "text": "As the world struggles to meet internationally agreed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, methods of removing carbon dioxide such as reforestation of cleared areas have become an increasingly important strategy.          But little attention has been paid to the potential for abandoned or marginal croplands to be restored to natural vegetation as an additional carbon sink, say MIT assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering C\u00e9sar Terrer, recent visiting MIT doctoral student Stephen M. Bell, and six others, in a recent open-access paper in the journal Nature Communications.Here, Terrer and Bell explain the potential use of these \"post-agricultural\" lands to help in the fight against damaging climate change.Q: How significant is the potential of unused agricultural lands as a carbon sink to help mitigate climate change?Bell: We know of these huge instances of land abandonment and post-agricultural succession throughout history, like following the collapse of major cities from ancient Mesopotamia to the Mayans. And when the Europeans arrived in the Americas in the 15th century, so many people died and so much forest grew back on abandoned farmland that it helped cool the entire planet and was potentially a driver of the coldest part of the so-called \"Little Ice Age\" period.Today, we have abandoned farmland all over the Mediterranean region, where I did my Ph.D. field work. As young people left rural areas for the cities throughout the 20th century, farmers couldn't pass on their land to anyone, and the land succeeded back into shrub lands and forests. The biggest recent example of abandonment is for sure the collapse of the Soviet Union, where an estimated 60 million hectares of forest regrew when support for collective farming stopped, resulting in one of the largest carbon sinks ever attributed to a single event.So, when we look back at the past, we know there's potential. Of course, these are huge events, and no one is proposing to replicate anything like that. We need to use land for multiple purposes, but looking back at these big examples, we know there is potential for abandoned or restored agricultural land to be carbon sinks. And so that tells us to dig deeper into this question and get a better idea of realistic scenarios, a better understanding of the climate change mitigation potential of agricultural cessation in the most strategic places.Terrer: More than 115 billion tons of carbon have been lost from soils due to agricultural practices that disturb soil integrity\u2014such as tilling, monoculture farming, removing crop residue, excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides, and over-grazing. To put this into perspective, the amount of carbon lost is equivalent to the total CO2 emissions ever produced in the United States.Our current research synthesizes field data from thousands of experiments, aiming to understand the factors that influence soil carbon accrual in abandoned croplands transitioning back to forests or natural grasslands. We're working to quantify the potential for carbon sequestration in these soils over 30-, 50-, and 100-year time frames and mapping the areas with the greatest potential for carbon storage. This includes both increases in soil carbon and in vegetation biomass.                This illustration shows a typical post-agricultural landscape (PAL) trajectory involving land clearing from the primary forest (natural control) for agricultural use (agricultural control) and ecological succession following agricultural cessation (shown here as early-, middle-, and late-stage PALs). Credit: Massachusetts Institute of Technology             Q: What are some of the key uncertainties in evaluating this potential for unused cropland to serve as a carbon sink, and how could those uncertainties be addressed?Bell: We use this word uncertainties in two ways. Specifically, the longevity of potential recarbonization, and the intensity of the potential recarbonization. Those are two factors, two aspects that we need to quantify to reduce our uncertainty.So, how long will the land recarbonize, regardless of the intensity? If the carbon level is going up, that's good. If there's more carbon increasing in the soil, we know that it came from somewhere, it came from the atmosphere. But how long does that happen? We know soil can get saturated. It can reach its carbon capacity limit, it won't continue to increase the carbon stock, and the recarbonization curve will flatten out. When does that happen? Is it after a hundred years? Is it after 20 years?But the world's soils are very diverse and complex, so what might be true in one place is not true in another place. It may take a longer time to reach saturation for more fertile soils in the Midwest U.S. than less fertile soils in the Southwest, for example. Alternatively, sometimes soils in drier areas like in the Southwest may never reach true saturation if they are degraded and have stalled recovery following abandonment.The second uncertainty is intensity: How high on the y-axis on the chart of recarbonization does saturation occur? With the analogy comparing U.S. soils, you might have a relatively huge carbon increase on an abandoned farm in the Southwest, but because the soil is not very carbon-rich it's not a large increase in absolute terms. In the Midwest, there might only be a small relative increase, but that increase could be much more in total than in the Southwest. These are just nuances to keep in mind as we look at this at the global scale.These nuances are essentially uncertainties. Soil carbon responses to agricultural land abandonment is complicated, and unfortunately it hasn't been studied in much detail so far. We need to reduce those uncertainties to get a better understanding of the recarbonization potential. This is easier said than done because not only do we have these temporal data uncertainties, but we also have spatial uncertainties. We don't have very good maps of past and present post-agricultural landscapes.Q: Can this potential use of post-agricultural lands be implemented without putting global food supplies at risk? How can these needs be balanced?Terrer: As to whether utilizing post-agricultural lands for carbon sequestration can be implemented without jeopardizing global food supplies, and how to balance these needs, our recent research provides valuable insights.The challenge, of course, lies in balancing cropland restoration for climate mitigation with food security for a growing global population. Abandoned croplands represent an opportunity for carbon sequestration without impacting active agricultural lands. However, the available area of abandoned croplands is insufficient to make a substantial impact on climate mitigation on its own.Thus, our proposal also emphasizes the importance of closing yield gaps, which involves increasing crop production per hectare to its theoretical limits. This would enable us to maintain or even increase global crop yields using only a fraction of the currently cultivated area, allowing the remaining land to be dedicated to climate mitigation efforts. By pursuing this strategy, we estimate that over half of the amount of soil carbon lost so far due to agriculture could be recovered, while ensuring food security for the world's population.

  "text": "Curbside recycling can compensate for the greenhouse gas emissions from garbage destined for landfills, says a new study that encourages towns and cities to continue offering recycling services to meet their climate goals.          The study's authors took a deep dive into the economic and environmental value of community recycling efforts and compared it to the value of other climate change mitigation practices. They concluded that recycling provides a return on investment similar to or better than environmentally friendly strategies like transitioning to electric vehicles or purchasing green power, which is electricity from clean, renewable energy sources.\"Eliminating recycling squanders one of the easiest opportunities for communities and citizens to help lessen the impact of climate change and reduce our demands on natural resources,\" said Timothy Townsend, a professor of environmental engineering sciences at the University of Florida and one of the study's authors. \"Recycling won't solve the problem alone, but it is part of the puzzle.\"Towns and cities across the country have canceled or scaled back recycling programs due to rising costs. Recent restrictions on recyclable material collected by major international markets have contributed to the cost increase, according to the study, which was published today in Nature Sustainability.Townsend and Malak Anshassi, of Florida Polytechnic University, set out to assess how much more expensive recycling is compared to garbage collection only and to see if the resale value of recyclables was at any time sufficient enough for the program to pay for itself. They also analyzed the role residential recycling plays in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and conserving natural resources.When recycling markets were most lucrative in 2011, U.S. recycling costs were as little as $3 a year per household. Beginning in 2018 and through 2020, tighter restrictions went into place and the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the markets, and the cost for recycling ranged from $34 to $42. The study asserts that even with higher costs, the investment offsets the greenhouse gas emissions from non-recycled waste buried in landfills.Townsend and Anshassi say that if local governments restructure their recycling programs to target materials with the greatest market value and the highest potential for carbon offset, recycling can pay for itself and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They identify higher-value materials as newspaper, cardboard, aluminum and steel cans, and HDPE and PET plastic bottles.\"Recycling is a public service provided by local governments to their residents, just like providing water, sewer, roads,\" Townsend says. \"It is a service that does have an expense, but it always has. I would argue that it does not cost much when you compare it to other services we pay for, and when markets are good, you hardly pay anything.\"Researchers also suggest that local and state governments could implement policies to help relieve the cost burden of recycling, like establishing a minimum amount of recyclable materials that manufacturers must use in packaging or products and placing some of the responsibility for recycling costs on the manufacturers.\"If we learn collectively to recycle better, we can reduce the costs to pretty much break even,\" Townsend says. \"From an environmental perspective, that's a good return on your investment.\" More information:Timothy Townsend, The hidden economic and environmental costs of eliminating kerb-side recycling, Nature Sustainability (2023).

  "text": "Current climate policies will leave more than a fifth of humanity exposed to dangerously hot temperatures by 2100, new research suggests. The paper, published in the journal Nature Sustainability, is entitled \"Quantifying the Human Cost of Global Warming.\"          Despite the Paris Agreement pledge to keep global warming well below 2\u00b0C (compared to pre-industrial levels), current policies are projected to result in 2.7\u00b0C warming by the end of the century.The new study, led by researchers at the Global Systems Institute, University of Exeter, associated with the Earth Commission, and Nanjing University, assessed what this would mean for the number of people living outside the \"climate niche\" in which our species has thrived.It says about 60 million people are already exposed to dangerous heat (average temperature of 29\u00b0C or higher).And 2 billion\u201422% of the projected end-of-century population\u2014would be exposed to this at 2.7\u00b0C of global warming.The paper highlights the \"huge potential\" for decisive climate policy to limit the human costs and inequities of climate change.Limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C would leave 5% exposed\u2014saving a sixth of humanity from dangerous heat compared to 2.7\u00b0C of warming.The study also finds that the lifetime emissions of 3.5 average global citizens today\u2014or just 1.2 U.S. citizens\u2014expose one future person to dangerous heat. This highlights the inequity of climate crisis, as these future heat-exposed people will live in places where emissions today are around half of the global average.In \"worst-case scenarios\" of 3.6\u00b0C or even 4.4\u00b0C global warming, half of the world's population could be left outside the climate niche, posing what the researchers call an \"existential risk.\"\"The costs of global warming are often expressed in financial terms, but our study highlights the phenomenal human cost of failing to tackle the climate emergency,\" said Professor Tim Lenton, director of the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter.\"For every 0.1\u00b0C of warming above present levels, about 140 million more people will be exposed to dangerous heat.\"This reveals both the scale of the problem and the importance of decisive action to reduce carbon emissions.\"Limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C rather than 2.7\u00b0C would mean five times fewer people in 2100 being exposed to dangerous heat.\"      Defining the nicheHuman population density has historically peaked in places with an average temperature of about 13\u00b0C, with a secondary peak at about 27\u00b0C (monsoon climates, especially in South Asia).Density of crops and livestock follow similar patterns, and wealth (measured by GDP) peaks at about 13\u00b0C.Mortality increases at both higher and lower temperatures, supporting the idea of a human \"niche.\"Although less than 1% of humanity currently live in places of dangerous heat exposure, the study shows climate change has already put 9% of the global population (more than 600 million people) outside the niche.\"Most of these people lived near the cooler 13\u00b0C peak of the niche and are now in the 'middle ground' between the two peaks. While not dangerously hot, these conditions tend to be much drier and have not historically supported dense human populations,\" said Professor Chi Xu, of Nanjing University.\"Meanwhile, the vast majority of people set to be left outside the niche due to future warming will be exposed to dangerous heat.\"Such high temperatures have been linked to issues including increased mortality, decreased labor productivity, decreased cognitive performance, impaired learning, adverse pregnancy outcomes, decreased crop yield, increased conflict and infectious disease spread.\"While some cooler places may become more habitable due to climate change, population growth is projected to be highest in places at risk of dangerous heat, especially India and Nigeria.The study also found:Exposure to dangerous heat starts to increase dramatically at 1.2\u00b0C (just above current global warming) and increases by about 140 million for every 0.1\u00b0C of further warming.Assuming a future population of 9.5 billion people, India would have the greatest population exposed at 2.7\u00b0C global warming\u2014more than 600 million. At 1.5\u00b0C, this figure would be far lower, at about 90 million.Nigeria would have the second-largest heat-exposed population at 2.7\u00b0C global warming, more than 300 million. At 1.5\u00b0C warming this would be less than 40 million.India and Nigeria already show \"hotspots\" of dangerous temperatures.At 2.7\u00b0C, almost 100% of some countries including Burkina Faso and Mali will be dangerously hot for humans. Brazil would have the largest land area exposed to dangerous heat, despite almost no area being exposed at 1.5\u00b0C. Australia and India would also experience massive increases in area exposed.The research team\u2014which included the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, and the Universities of Washington, North Carolina State, Aarhus and Wageningen\u2014stress that the worst of these impacts can be avoided by rapid action to cut greenhouse gas emissions.Speaking about the conception of their idea, Professor Marten Scheffer, of Wageningen University, said, \"We were triggered by the fact that the economic costs of carbon emissions hardly reflect the impact on human well-being.\"Our calculations now help bridging this gap and should stimulate asking new, unorthodox questions about justice.\"Ashish Ghadiali, of Exeter's Global Systems Institute, said, \"These new findings from the leading edge of Earth systems science underline the profoundly racialized nature of projected climate impacts and should inspire a policy sea-change in thinking around the urgency of decarbonization efforts as well as in the value of massively up-shifting global investment into the frontlines of climate vulnerability.\"Wendy Broadgate, Executive Director of the Earth Commission at Future Earth, said, \"We are already seeing effects of dangerous heat levels on people in different parts of the world today. This will only accelerate unless we take immediate and decisive action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\"Work on climate solutions by the Global Systems Institute at the University of Exeter has identified \"positive tipping points\" to accelerate action, including a recent report that highlighted three \"super-leverage points\" that could trigger a cascade of decarbonization.

  "text": "A team of atmospheric scientists and oceanologists from the University of Saskatchewan, GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel and Utrecht University, has found that there is more man-made bromoform (CHBr3) in the lower atmosphere than previously thought. In their study, reported in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, the group used existing data to create models depicting amounts of bromoform in the atmosphere.          Prior research has shown that phytoplankton and algae produce bromoform, a brominated organic solvent that seeps into the lower atmosphere where it decomposes, releasing bromide. Bromide has been found to rise into the stratosphere, where it degrades the ozone layer. Prior research has also found that human-produced bromoform does much the same, but because of its short lifetime, it was believed not to pose a risk to the ozone.For that reason, it was not included in the 1987 Montreal Protocol, an international agreement that banned emissions of chemicals that harm the ozone layer, most particularly hydrofluorocarbons. And while it has been acknowledged that banning such chemicals had a dramatic positive impact on the ozone layer, more recent research has shown that more needs to be done. In this new effort, the research team suggests that bromoform may need to be banned, as well.The researchers collected existing data regarding emissions of bromoform from power plants, ship ballast and desalination plants. They used that data to create multiple simulations to show the impact of such emissions on the ozone layer. The team found that power plants produce by far the most: approximately 10% to 25.9% of all man-made bromoform.The research team then compared their models with samples collected from airplanes in the past few years. The simulations agreed with the field observations. They note that both findings show that man-made bromoform emissions are higher than previously believed and that they might explain why the ozone layer has not yet fully recovered after initiation of the Montreal Protocol.

They're managing a stretch of land in a way that welcomes both local people and scientists to engage in preserving the world's largest tropical forest.          The goal is ambitious, counter the forces that have destroyed 10% of the forest in less than four decades and create something that can be replicated in other parts of the Amazon.It began with a four-month expedition along the Juru\u00e1 River in 2016. Researchers visited some 100 communities that at first sight looked similar: rows of wooden homes on stilts along the water. But they were struck by contrasts in the living conditions.To understand what they saw, it's important to know that 29% of the Amazon, an area roughly three times the size of California, is either public land with no special protection, or public land for which no public information exists, according to a study by the Amazon Institute of People and the Environment.These areas have been shown to be more vulnerable to deforestation. Land robbers drive traditional communities off the land and then clear it, hoping the government will recognize them as owners, which usually happens.\"It's very unequal. Inside protected areas, there are many positive things happening, but outside, they seemed to be 40 years behind,\" Jo\u00e3o Vitor Campos-Silva, a tropical socio-ecologist, told The Associated Press.

Credit: AP Photo/Jorge Saenz             The researchers were aware that the part of the river known as Medio Juru\u00e1, near the city of Carauari, has remarkable social organization and people manage its fish and forest products, such as acai, sustainably. The land designation here is \"extractive reserves,\" public lands where residents are allowed to fish and harvest some crops.But outside these reserves, in many places, people take orders from self-appointed landowners, Campos-Silva said. Entire communities are denied access to lakes, even to fish to feed their families. People don\u00b4t own the land, and they don't know who does.\"We started thinking that it might be interesting to design a conservation model based on a basin scale,\" where communities could harvest forest produce and fish and protect the forest, instead of moving to the city or resorting to illegal activities, such as unlicensed logging and overfishing.

It includes about 20 lakes, some with good potential for raising prized pirarucu, the world's largest freshwater scale fish, which can reach up to 200 kilos (440 pounds).      The goal, Campos-Silva said, is to promote high-quality science, grounded in working together with the region's people.In the vicinity of the Institute's land there are 12 communities of former rubber-tappers. Brazilians call them \"ribeirinhos,\" or river people, as distinguished from Indigenous residents.In the past, the chance to make a living from rubber trees drew their grandparents to the Amazon. Nowadays the main revenue comes from pirarucu. Controlling that fishery has proved to be sustainable, reviving a species that was in decline and generating income without the need to clear the forest, with all that means for loss of biodiversity.

Credit: AP Photo/Jorge Saenz             The Amazon rainforest, covering an area twice the size of India, also holds tremendous stores of carbon and is a crucial buffer against climate change. Driven by land-robbers, deforestation surged to a 15-year high in recent years while Jair Bolsonaro, who left office in January, was president. Destruction in the eastern Amazon has been so extensive that it has become a carbon source, rather than a carbon sink.To involve the riverine communities in governance, the institute set up a steering committee and launched a series of public meetings called \"community of dreams,\" where people could prioritize the improvements they want most.To avoid potential gender and age biases, they worked in three groups\u2014women, youth, and men, said Campos-Silva.The president of the river communities' association, Fernanda de Araujo Moraes, said the main purpose is to prevent river people from moving to Amazon cities, where unemployment among low-skilled people is rampant and violence is widespread, thanks to drug-trafficking.

If it works, which it will, it will attract a lot of people's attention,\" Morais, a resident, told the Associated Press. Credit: AP Photo/Jorge Saenz             In her own community of Lago Serrado, where 12 families live in stilt houses, both the women and men listed 24-hour electricity as their top priority. Currently, it's only available three hours a day. The youths chose fishing training.Moraes believes this kind of collaboration is the fastest route to progress. \"We want to improve people's lives and the Institute wants the same thing,\" she said, seated on the floor of her house, tending to her infant daughter. The government, she said, is not always on the same page.\"This is something that doesn't exist here in the Amazon, it doesn't exist anywhere in Brazil. If it works, which it will, it will attract a lot of people's attention,\" said resident Jose\u0301 Alves de Morais, in an interview by the lake just behind the community.Morais works as a lake keeper, watching for trespassers who might take fish or cut trees. His family hopes to take part in the institute's management of pirarucu fishing, which awaits federal approval.

Credit: AP Photo/Jorge Saenz             On the scientific front, the institute has built a houseboat and a wooden house for as many as 20 researchers to spend seasons along the Juru\u00e1 River. One is studying the uakari monkey. Others are looking at what makes social arrangements successful in the region. They created a program, Forest Scientists, to train local high school students in field collection, data systematization, and how to prepare reports.The initiative is led by Carlos Peres, an Amazon-born professor of tropical conservation ecology at the University of East Anglia, in the United Kingdom. In April this work, begun as an experiment, got some recognition from a Swiss nonprofit when he and three other scientists won the Frontiers Planet Prize, which comes with $1.1 million. The money will be reinvested in the project, which has already received support from Synchronicity Earth, National Geographic and Rolex within Perpetual Planet Project.The winning study used data gathered during that 2016 trip. Co-authored by Campos-Silva and others, it found communities living inside protected areas enjoy better access to health care, education, electricity, and basic sanitation, plus a more stable income, than communities in undesignated areas. They found only 5% of adults inside protected areas aspire to move to a city, compared with 58% of adults in unprotected areas.

  "text": "The pixel size of satellite imagery is getting finer and finer in the last decade with the development spaceborne cameras. What is in store for Earth observations if the 10-cm satellite imagery is available in near future? Forest remote sensing scientists believe it may open a new era for the detection of tree heights.          Scientists from the Aerospace Information Research Institute (AIR), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), have proposed a new algorithm called AGAR, which makes it possible to detect tree heights only using 10-cm stereoscopic imagery, according to a study published in Remote Sensing of Environment on May 10.Tree heights are important structural parameters reflecting forest productivity and health, and they play a key role in assessing forest ecological services and functions in terms of biodiversity and forest carbon stock.Elevations derived from stereoscopic imagery are a blend of ground surface with heights of forest stands. No new methods have been identified to overcome the challenge of measuring topography beneath dense vegetation cover, although the deciduous forest could be described by leaf-off stereoscopic imagery, and sparse forests could be described through changes in sun elevation angles. It is currently impossible to separate terrain elevations with forest heights only using stereoscopic imagery due to the occlusion of forest canopies and the limited penetration capability of passive optical imagery.Current stereoscopic imagery is obtained based on the analysis of satellite images with spatial resolutions of 15 meters to 2 meters. Changes of ground surface elevations are in the same scale with that of forest stand heights under this spatial resolution. It is indeed difficult to separate them at this viewpoint.Scientists found that 10-cm stereoscopic imagery enabled the separation of the mixture at the scale of trees instead of forest stands by making use of image segmentations and allometric equations. Validation results using UAV stereoscopic imagery under different terrain conditions showed the AGAR algorithm could effectively separate terrains from forest heights, and is capable of providing more reasonable predictions of tree heights with minimal influence from terrains.\"This study could contribute to spaceborne stereoscopic imagery on forest vertical structures in the future,\" said Prof. Ni Wenjian, corresponding author of the study.

  "text": "GeoMAP Antarctica, an open-access and comprehensive geological mapping database of Antarctica, was released May 18 in the journal Scientific Data. Understanding Antarctica's geosphere is, and has been, critical for understanding the continent's major role in global climate\u2014and thus, our future.          Constructing GeoMAP was a large, and long-term, international effort from Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), led by GNS Science in New Zealand. The project involved principal collaborators from U.S., Norway, Italy, UK, Australia, Russia and New Zealand\u2014including British Antarctic Survey Field Geologist, Dr. Alex Burton-Johnson.Despite Antarctica's reputation as an icy expanse, over 52,000 km2 of exposed rock and sediment make up the mountains and surfaces of the continent. Each of these areas contain important information on the continent's geological, geomorphological, and glaciological history. Put simply, rocks play an important role in\u2014and tell us a lot about\u2014the complex interaction of land, atmosphere, and climate. Geological knowledge of the continent's mountains, sediments and soils, helps pinpoint the location, history and movement of glaciers, and even meltwater production. These insights provide foundational knowledge for researchers, from climate scientists, to biologists, to ecologists and volcanologists.Today, GeoMAP is the first detailed, digital, open-access database that collates all the historical, and existing, geological data of Antarctica. Geological study has taken place in Antarctica for over a century, so constructing GeoMAP to compile the existing geological knowledge into one place, took several years. The research effort included interpreting information from beautiful 20th century hand-drawn maps, digitizing hard-copy regional maps, and then integrating them with modern high-resolution datasets.Lead data architect, Belinda Smith Lyttle from GNS Science says, \"There are still many areas in Antarctica yet to be visited by any geologist, and other areas where very detailed mapping has yet to be captured\u2014and there is always new research taking place\u2014so the GeoMAP database has been designed to be editable and improved over time.\" More information:Simon C.

  "question_squad": " What is the region of the Earth's upper atmosphere where molecules and atoms are ionized by solar radiation called?",
  "answer_squad": " The ionosphere",
  "text": "An international team has used satellite- and ground-based ionospheric observations to demonstrate that an air pressure wave triggered by volcanic eruptions could produce an equatorial plasma bubble (EPB) in the ionosphere, severely disrupting satellite-based communications. Their findings were published in the journal Scientific Reports.          The ionosphere is the region of the Earth's upper atmosphere where molecules and atoms are ionized by solar radiation, creating positively charged ions. The area with the highest concentration of ionized particles is called the F-region, an area 150 to 800 kilometers above the Earth's surface. The F-region plays a crucial role in long-distance radio communication, reflecting and refracting radio waves used by satellite and GPS tracking systems back to the Earth's surface.These important transmissions can be disrupted by irregularities in the F-region. During the day, the ionosphere is ionized by the Sun's ultraviolet radiation, creating a density gradient of electrons with the highest density near the equator. However, disruptions to this, such as the movement of plasma, electric fields, and neutral winds, can cause the formation of a localized irregularity of enhanced plasma density. This region can grow and evolve, creating a bubble-like structure called an EPB. EPB can delay radio waves and degrade the performance of GPS.Since these density gradients can be affected by atmospheric waves, it has long been hypothesized that they are formed by terrestrial events such as volcanic activity. For an international team led by Designated Assistant Professor Atsuki Shinbori (he, him) and Professor Yoshizumi Miyoshi (he, him) of the Institute for Space\u2013Earth Environmental Research (ISEE), Nagoya University, in collaboration with NICT, The University of Electro-Communications, Tohoku University, Kanazawa University, Kyoto University and ISAS, the Tonga volcano eruption offered them a perfect opportunity to test this theory.The Tonga volcano eruption was the biggest submarine eruption in history. This allowed the team to test their theory using the Arase satellite to detect EPB occurrences, the Himawari-8 satellite to check the initial arrival of air pressure waves and ground-based ionospheric observations to track the motion of the ionosphere. They observed an irregular structure of the electron density across the equator that occurred after the arrival of pressure waves generated by the volcanic eruption.      \"The results of this study showed EPBs generated in the equatorial to low-latitude ionosphere in Asia in response to the arrival of pressure waves caused by undersea volcanic eruptions off Tonga,\" Shinbori said.The group also made a surprising discovery. For the first time, they showed that ionospheric fluctuations start a few minutes to a few hours earlier than the atmospheric pressure waves involved in the generation of plasma bubbles. This could have important implications because it suggests that the long-held model of geosphere-atmosphere-cosmosphere coupling, which states that ionospheric disturbances only happen after the eruption, needs revision.\"Our new finding is that the ionospheric disturbances are observed several minutes to hours before the initial arrival of the shock waves triggered by the Tonga volcanic eruption,\" Shinbori said. \"This suggests that the propagation of the fast atmospheric waves in the ionosphere triggered the ionospheric disturbances before the initial arrival of the shock waves. Therefore, the model needs to be revised to account for these fast atmospheric waves in the ionosphere.\"They also found that the EPB extended much further than predicted by the standard models. \"Previous studies have shown that the formation of plasma bubbles at such high altitudes is a rare occurrence, making this a very unusual phenomenon,\" Shinbori said. \"We found that the EPB formed by this eruption reached space even beyond the ionosphere, suggesting that we should pay attention to the connection between the ionosphere and the cosmosphere when extreme natural phenomenon, such as the Tonga event, occur.\"\"The results of this research are significant not only from a scientific point of view but also from the point of view of space weather and disaster prevention,\" he said. \"In the case of a large-scale event, such as the Tonga volcano eruption, observations have shown that a hole in the ionosphere can form even under conditions that are considered unlikely to occur under normal circumstances. Such cases have not been incorporated into space weather forecast models. This study will contribute to the prevention of satellite broadcasting and communication failures associated with ionospheric disturbances caused by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and other events.\" More information:Generation of equatorial plasma bubble after the 2022 Tonga volcanic eruption, Scientific Reports (2023).

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the new measurement that incorporates the timing and amount of snowfall?",
  "answer_squad": " Snow Storage Index",
  "text": "Snow is melting earlier, and more rain is falling instead of snow in the mountain ranges of the Western U.S. and Canada, leading to a leaner snowpack that could impact agriculture, wildfire risk and municipal water supplies come summer, according to a new study from the University of Colorado Boulder.          Published in Nature Communications Earth & Environment, the study documents more than 60 years of change in snowpack water storage across Western North America. It found that from 1950 to 2013, snowpack water storage has significantly declined in more than 25% of the Mountain West, in part because more snow is melting during winter and spring, eroding this seasonal boundary.\"On average and in every mountainous region that we looked at, snow melt is occurring closer in time to when it fell,\" said Kate Hale, lead author of the study and a 2022 geography graduate. \"The timing of water availability is shifting toward earlier in the springtime, with less snow melt and water availability later in the summertime, suggesting that there will be water scarcity later in the year.\"Timing is everything The Western U.S. and Canada depend on snow for most of their water. The Rocky Mountains, Sierra Nevadas and other mountain ranges have long served as, essentially, water towers for the region: They store snow throughout the winter, which then melts and becomes available as water in spring and summer, when demand is greatest.Every year on April 1, state and regional water managers use a metric known as snow water equivalent (SWE)\u2014how much water will be produced when an amount of snow melts\u2014to predict and plan for water resources that year, said Hale, now a postdoctoral researcher at University of Vermont.But that April 1 snapshot is exactly that: one moment in time. It doesn't reveal if that snow slowly accumulated over the past six months, if it all fell in one giant heap on March 31, or if it was already melting.\"From a hydrologic perspective, the only thing that's unique about snow is that it delays the timing of water input to watersheds. And just looking at a snapshot of snow water equivalent doesn't give you a sense as to how long that snow water equivalent has been on the ground,\" said Noah Molotch, associate professor of geography and fellow at the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR) at CU Boulder.So Hale used two publicly available data sources to develop a new measurement known as Snow Storage Index (SSI) that incorporates the timing and amount of snowfall, as well as snowmelt, before and after April 1. In contrast to the singular moment in time captured by SWE, Hale's SSI shows a metaphorical video: incorporating into one number, the time between when rain or snow falls on a landscape in the winter season and when it becomes available to that area as surface water.\"The snow storage index allows us to look at snow water storage, not just in the context of how much is there at any given time, but the duration of that storage on the ground,\" said Molotch.This allowed the researchers to analyze how well each mountainous region of the West has acted as a water tower over the past 60 years and discover that their performance has been declining across the board.      Managing water now and for the future A \"high\" SSI\u2014a number as close to 1.0 as possible\u2014was found in places where snowfall is very seasonal. In the Cascades, for example, snow accumulates in the fall and winter season, and is stored up to six months before melting somewhat continuously in the spring and summer. Here in Colorado's Rocky Mountains, however, the SSI is lower\u2014somewhere between 0 and 0.5\u2014which means that snow both accumulates and melts throughout the colder half of the year.But because the Rockies and the Front Range are already used to this alternating pattern of snowfall and snowmelt during winter and spring seasons, as a region it may adjust easier to similar patterns of decreased snowpack water storage associated with global warming. The mountain regions near the West Coast that are highly reliant on snowpack meltwater in the spring and summer, however, may be in for a painful adjustment when that water melts earlier in the year\u2014and is simply no longer available come late summer.The researchers hope that this new measurement can serve as a tool for scientists and water resource managers to make better predictions and, when necessary, plan ahead for less.Half a century ago, an era of dam building in the Western United States allowed the region to flourish in terms of access to water for cities and for agriculture, said Molotch. But as these \"water towers\" melt away, so too may the reservoirs they filled.\"The snowpack is eroding and disappearing before our eyes. That's going to present challenges in terms of managing the infrastructure that's allowed the Western United States to flourish over the last 100 years,\" said Molotch.Additional authors on this publication include: Keith Jennings, Lynker, Boulder, Colorado; Keith Musselman, Department of Geography and the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR), CU Boulder; and Ben Livneh, Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Architectural Engineering, CU Boulder.

  "text": "Weather-related disasters have surged over the past 50 years, causing swelling economic damage even as early warning systems have meant dramatically fewer deaths, the United Nations said Monday.          Extreme weather, climate and water-related events caused 11,778 reported disasters between 1970 and 2021, new figures from the UN's World Meteorological Organization (WMO) show.Those disasters killed just over two million people and caused $4.3 trillion in economic losses.\"The most vulnerable communities unfortunately bear the brunt of weather, climate and water-related hazards,\" WMO chief Petteri Taalas said in a statement.The report found that over 90 percent of reported deaths worldwide due to disasters over the 51-year-period occurred in developing countries.But the agency also said improved early warning systems and coordinated disaster management had significantly reduced the human casualty toll.WMO pointed out in a report issued two years ago covering disaster-linked deaths and losses between 1970 and 2019, that at the beginning of the period the world was seeing more than 50,000 such deaths each year.By the 2010s, the disaster death toll had dropped to below 20,000 annually.And in its update of that report, WMO said Monday that 22,608 disaster deaths were recorded globally in 2020 and 2021 combined.'Early warnings save lives'Cyclone Mocha, which wreaked havoc in Myanmar and Bangladesh last week, exemplifies this, Taalas said.Mocha \"caused widespread devastation... impacting the poorest of the poor,\" he said.But while Myanmar's junta has put the death toll from the cyclone at 145, Taalas pointed out that during similar disasters in the past, \"both Myanmar and Bangladesh suffered death tolls of tens and even hundreds of thousands of people\".\"Thanks to early warnings and disaster management these catastrophic mortality rates are now thankfully history. Early warnings save lives.\"The UN has launched a plan to ensure all nations are covered by disaster early warning systems by the end of 2027.Endorsing that plan figures among the top strategic priorities during a meeting of WMO's decision-making body, the World Meteorological Congress, which opens Monday.To date, only half of countries have such systems in place.Surging economic lossesWMO meanwhile warned that while deaths have plunged, the economic losses incurred when weather, climate and water extremes hit have soared.The agency previously recorded economic losses increased sevenfold between 1970 and 2019, rising from $49 million per day during the first decade to $383 million per day in the final one.Wealthy countries have been hardest hit by far in monetary terms.The United States alone incurred $1.7 trillion in losses, or 39 percent of economic losses globally due to disasters since 1970.But while the dollar figures on losses suffered in poorer nations were not particularly high, they were far higher in relation to the size of their economies, WMO noted.Developed nations accounted for over 60 percent of losses due to weather, climate and water disasters, but in more than four-fifths of cases, the economic losses were equivalent to less than 0.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).And no disasters saw reported economic losses greater than 3.5 percent of the respective GDPs.By comparison, in seven percent of the disasters to hit the world's least developed countries, losses equivalent to more than five percent of their GDP were reported, with several disasters causing losses equivalent to nearly a third of GDP.And for small island developing states, one fifth of disasters saw economic losses of over five percent of GDP, with some causing economic losses above 100 percent.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Early warning systems send disaster deaths plunging: UN (2023, May 22)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-early-disaster-deaths-plunging.html  This document is subject to copyright.

The wildfires in Alberta province have displaced tens of thousands of people and scorched more than 941,000 hectares over several weeks.\"It is a mixed bag certainly with smoke,\" Christie Tucker of the Alberta Wildfire agency told a briefing.\"Many Albertans obviously can't get away from the smoke this weekend. It is thick in many parts of the province,\" she said. \"But they would also have noticed that temperatures are cooler than they would have been if there was no smoke covering the sun.\"Less heat, Tucker explained, \"has meant that we've seen less growth of fires.\" Only five new flare-ups were reported since Friday.On the other hand, she added, firefighters haven't been able to fly aircraft as often to get an accurate picture of the size and number of fires burning over the last few days.Weather maps have shown smoke from the fires covering more than one million square miles (2.7 million square kilometers) and stretching as far as the eastern coast of North America and the Arctic.Environment Canada issued warnings about poor air quality posing \"very high risks\" to health in the cities of Edmonton and Calgary, where the sky had an orange hue and the smell of smoke lingered in the air.Residents were urged to limit outdoor activities.Air quality alerts were also issued in several US states as plumes of thick smoke from Alberta drifted across the border.In recent years, western Canada has been hit repeatedly by extreme weather, the intensity and frequency of which have increased due to global warming.Above-average daytime weekend highs of 28 degrees Celsius (82 degrees Fahrenheit) were forecast to drop by about 10 degrees by Monday and stay low throughout the week.More rain is also anticipated after several showers swept through Alberta this weekend.But, Tucker said, \"While we're optimistic that the forecast rain will be enough to make a difference to some wildfires in the province, we are not out of the woods yet.\"    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Smoke choking Canadians but cooling wildfires by blocking out sun (2023, May 22)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-canadians-cooling-wildfires-blocking-sun.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Despite our understanding of nutrition expanding remarkably in recent times, few aspects of our diet continue to confuse and divide the experts like nitrate.          For a long time nitrate has been viewed warily, with previous research showing it could potentially be linked to causing cancer.However, subsequent research has revealed dietary nitrate also has various cardiovascular health benefits, which could help reduce the risk of related conditions such as heart disease, dementia and diabetes.So, how can one dietary compound have such contrasting potential risks and benefits?Edith Cowan University's (ECU) Nutrition and Health Innovation Research Institute hopes to find out how and why nitrate such contrasting potential risks and benefits.All about the sourceDr. Catherine Bondonno led a review of nitrate research and says the key may lie in where it comes from.\"We get nitrate from three major dietary sources: meat, water and vegetables,\" she said.\"Nitrate's reputation as a health threat stems from 1970, when two studies showed it can form N-nitrosamines, which are highly carcinogenic in laboratory animals.\"However, no human studies have confirmed its potential dangers, and our clinical and observational studies support nitrate preventing cardiovascular disease, if it's sourced from vegetables.\"So the review looked to unpack all of that, identify new ways forward and ways that we can solve this puzzle, because it's really time to address it: it's been 50 years.\"Urgency requiredDespite recent research indicating the source of nitrate may affect its health benefits and risks, current dietary guidelines relating to nitrate have been in place since the 1970s and don't differentiate between nitrate from meat, vegetables and water.Dr. Bondonno said while the 1970s animal studies reported a small incidence of malignant tumours, there was evidence not all nitrates deserve to be \"tarred with the same brush\".\"For instance, unlike meat and water-derived nitrate, nitrate-rich vegetables contain high levels of vitamin C and/or polyphenols that may inhibit formation of those harmful N-nitrosamines associated with cancer,\" she said.Dr. Bondonno said it was vital more research was conducted so guidelines could be updated.\"The public are unlikely to listen to messages to increase intake of nitrate-rich vegetables, if they are concerned about a link between nitrate intake and cancer.\"However, she stressed while official guidelines hadn't changed, the apparent benefits of nitrate had seen many people potentially put themselves at risk.\"We need to be sure nitrate-rich vegetables don't actually have an increased risk of cancer if we consume a higher amount,\" she said.\"High dosage nitrate supplements are already used to improve physical performance in sport, while vegetable nitrate extracts are being added to cured meat products with a \"clean label\" claim, purporting to be better for you.\"So we really need to get this right.\"What do we eat, then?Given its divided experts in the field, Dr. Bondonno said it's understandable people may be confused as to whether nitrate is good or bad for them.\"They're probably thinking, 'If I can't have a salad, what CAN I have?',\" she said.Despite the debate, she said current evidence suggests people should aim to get their nitrate from vegetables\u2014but there was no need to go overboard.\"Dark green, leafy vegetables and beetroot are good sources, our research shows one cup of raw, or half a cup cooked per day is enough to have the benefits on cardiovascular health,\" she said.\"We know processed meat isn't good for us and we should limit our intake, but whether it's the nitrate in them that is causing the problem or something else, we don't know.\"It just further emphasises the need to investigate dietary nitrate to clarify the message for people.\"The potential cancer link was raised 50 years ago; now it's time to conduct an in-depth analysis to distinguish fact from fiction.\"'Nitrate: The Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of human health?' was published in Trends in Food Science & Technology.More information:Catherine P.

  "text": "Almost 40% of forest area burned by wildfire in the western United States and southwestern Canada in the last 40 years can be attributed to carbon emissions associated with the world's 88 largest fossil fuel producers and cement manufacturers, according to new research that seeks to hold oil and gas companies accountable for their role in climate change.          In findings published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Research Letters, the authors concluded that the emissions generated in the extraction of fossil fuels, as well as the burning of those fuels, have increased the amount of land burned by wildfire by raising global temperatures and amplifying dry conditions across the West. This growing dryness, or aridification, has caused the atmosphere to become \"thirstier\" for water, draining moisture from trees and brush and causing them to become more vulnerable to fire, the researchers say.The study is the latest in a growing body of research known as extreme event attribution, or attribution science, which seeks to determine how much global warming has contributed to events such as heat waves, droughts and wildfires.\"We hope that people who are in communities that have been affected by wildfires will see this work and think about whether they want to hold these companies accountable,\" said study author Kristina Dahl, principal climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists.To quantify the impact of the fossil fuel industry on wildfires, Dahl and her colleagues built on previous research that has shown that carbon emissions traced to the top 88 fossil fuel producers and cement manufacturers\u2014including Exxon Mobil, BP, Chevron and Shell\u2014have contributed significantly to the average temperature by which the Earth has warmed. (Cement production is responsible for 8% of human-generated carbon dioxide\u2014significantly less than the burning of fossil fuels.)The researchers found that changes in global mean temperature are positively linked with changes in the Western North American vapor pressure deficit, a measure of how effectively the air can dry out plants and vegetation that ultimately become fuel for wildfires, Dahl said.\"I actually laughed because I've never had such a strong correlation in my data before,\" she said.The researchers were then able to estimate that emissions from the major carbon producers contributed to 48% of the increase in the vapor pressure deficit observed over the last 120 years. Previous research has shown that this rise is strongly associated with an increase in burned forest lands in the western U.S. and southwestern Canada.      From there, the researchers found that the emissions were responsible for 37% of the 53 million acres of forest area\u2014or 19.8 million acres\u2014burned by wildfire since 1986.The results don't account for the effects of non-climate factors, including fire suppression, the prohibition of Indigenous burning and increases in human-sparked fires associated with more people moving into wilderness areas, which have played a role in driving the size and severity of individual fires, but have not affected the relationship between climate and burned area, the study notes.Asked to comment on the findings, a spokesman for the Western States Petroleum Assn. said that \"demonization\" of the fossil fuel industry would not bring solutions.\"We all want the same thing: affordable, reliable and ever-cleaner energy and fuels,\" Kevin Slagle wrote in an email. \"A press release from a well-funded activist group with a long history of attacking energy industries is unhelpful to the serious and realistic climate and energy policy discussions needed to get us there.\"Up until relatively recently, the public posture of the climate science community was that no individual extreme event could be attributed to global warming, said Noah Diffenbaugh, climate scientist at Stanford University's Doerr School of Sustainability, who was not involved in the study. That changed in the early 2000s, and extreme event attribution has since become a robust sub-field of climate science, he said.Although the sub-field does not exist to provide data for legal actions, it in some ways arose from questions of law, he said. Some of its earliest examination in scholarly literature was in law review articles about the need to quantify the contribution of historical global warming to individual events for the purposes of assigning liability, he said.Since then, attribution research has served as a foundation for liability lawsuits filed against fossil fuel companies.Last month, in what was seen as a major victory for plaintiffs, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear appeals from oil and gas companies that were seeking to have lawsuits over climate change filed by state and local governments moved to federal courts. The decision cleared a path for dozens of similar lawsuits to be heard in state courts, where communities that are suing are believed to have better chances of winning sizable damages.\"What this study shows is that using existing peer-reviewed methods, it is possible to rigorously trace the contributions from the source of emissions to the impacts,\" Diffenbaugh said.Another scientist who was not involved with the study said the authors' methodology appeared sound.Rong Fu, the director of the UCLA Joint Institute for Regional Earth System Science and Engineering, has also studied the link between global warming and increasingly destructive wildfires. If anything, study authors might have underestimated the impacts of the companies' emissions because they included aerosol emissions in their calculations, Fu said.Aerosols\u2014small particles in the air that can come from the burning of fossil fuels\u2014tend to cool surface temperatures, she said. But these emissions have shorter lifetimes, and they tend to decrease as technology improves, she said. As that happens, we are likely to see a stronger warming, she said.\"This paper really takes to the next level that linking of these increases in wildfires to the main emitters in the world,\" Fu said.When considering the connection between fossil fuels and extreme events, Dahl said it was important to recognize that the impacts of climate-driven disasters have not been borne equally.As wildfires in the western U.S. have grown in size and intensity, and wrought unprecedented levels of damage on communities, the public has been left to cover much of the cost through higher taxes and utility bill surcharges, she said.\"But at the same time, we know the fossil fuel industry has known for decades what the impact of their products would be on our climate, and that emissions associated with those companies have significantly altered our climate,\" she said. \"We really wanted to put a spotlight on the fossil fuel industry's role in driving the West's worsening wildfires so they can be held accountable for their share of the costs.\"\"I think a lot of us in California are used to thinking about corporate accountability for wildfires as just being limited to Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and the immediate utility failures that have sparked some of the state's largest and deadliest wildfires,\" she added. \"But the reality is there's this much bigger set of corporate actors who have not been held accountable at all.\" More information:Kristina A Dahl et al, Quantifying the contribution of major carbon producers to increases in vapor pressure deficit and burned area in western US and southwestern Canadian forests, Environmental Research Letters (2023).

  "text": "Screams, dismembered bodies among the thousands dead, and his town buried in mud. Survivor William Suarez remembers the horror of Colombia's Nevado del Ruiz volcanic eruption of 1985, but he dismisses authorities' latest warnings of a repeat.          \"I just don't believe that\" threat alert, the 73-year-old with a gray mustache scoffed recently when asked about the underlying risk of another eruption.Like him, many of the 57,000 residents who live in the danger zone surrounding the Andes volcano refuse to evacuate despite the government's request and an orange alert that has been in force since March.That's when the recorded seismic tremors inside the crater soared, from 50 per day to 12,000.Still, Suarez stubbornly believes the more than 5,300-meter (17,400-foot) colossus that elders call \"sleeping lion\"\u2014and which lies within the Pacific Ring of Fire that contains many of the world's most active volcanoes\u2014will not erupt again for \"about 50 years\" or so.Authorities fear a major Nevado del Ruiz eruption could cause the kind of devastation that shattered the area back in 1985.In a matter of hours, an expulsion of lava melted part of the volcano's snowcap, creating raging torrents of mud, ash and rocks that streamed down the mountainside and buried the town of Armero. Some 25,000 people were killed in the worst natural disaster in the country's modern history.                William Suarez, a survivor of the last big erruption of Nevado del Ruiz volcano, stands in front of the church of the Rio Claro village in Villamaria, Colombia.             Still, practical matters weigh on the choices facing farmers, who must decide whether to stay put and tend to their crops and pack animals, or heed the evacuation call and abandon their livelihoods.Suarez is a farmer from Viejo Rio Claro, a riverside village nestled between mountains and belonging to the town of Villamaria, one of the areas declared to be at high risk.Almost four decades on, he recalls when the volcano roared to life with catastrophic consequences.\"High up there you could see it belching fire, like the color of bricks, and the earth was shaking,\" Suarez told AFP of that November 13 night. \"People started screaming and running on the road.\"The next day \"there were pieces of hands, arms, half bodies, decapitated heads,\" he said, standing next to the church that remains intact.                View of a sign telling the story of the church of the Rio Calro village which survived the last major eruption of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano in 1985, in Villamaria, Colombia.             'Astonishment'Over the past several days, in Villamaria and the neighboring city of Manizales, an unusual stench has been noticed by many.      According to the Geological Service (SGC) it could be due to the dispersion of a high concentration of sulfur dioxide, combined with \"ash components\" and moisture.From Manizales, thick clouds can be seen around the snow-capped mountain, which according to Castano concentrate gases, water vapor and ash from the crater.The SGC has warned that settlements on the banks of the rivers near the volcano suffer a high risk from potential flows of sediments, mud and volcanic debris.Yet locals in Viejo Rio Claro feel prepared in the event of an emergency.Jose Jaramillo, 71, said he is relying on training he received as a first responder and firefighter in the event of an eruption.                A man walks in the main square of Villamaria, Colombia.             \"(We are) eager for the event to happen so we can end this anxiety... and put into practice everything we've learned,\" says Jaramillo, who arrived in the town after the 1985 eruption.Felix Giraldo, head of risk management for the area, estimates that in the rural confines of Villamar\u00eda there are some 1,200 families at risk from a new eruption.While tensions may have eased in the weeks since the government issued its orange alert, Giraldo insists the threat remains real.\"We cannot let our guard down,\" he said.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Despite rumblings, Colombia volcano survivor skeptical of repeat disaster (2023, May 21)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-rumblings-colombia-volcano-survivor-skeptical.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Faced with mounting pressure over planet-heating pollution, Gulf Arab energy giants are turning to humble tech start-ups as they search for ways to remove emissions while keeping oil flowing.          Oil producers have for years touted capturing carbon before it goes into the atmosphere as a potential global warming solution, against criticism from climate experts who say it risks distracting from the urgent goal of slashing fossil fuel pollution.With little investment and few projects in operation around the world so far, the technology is currently nowhere near the scale needed to make a difference to global emissions.Now major players from Saudi Aramco to the United Arab Emirates' ADNOC say that is about to change, as the UAE hosts climate negotiations this year with a message of cutting emissions rather than fossil fuels.\"For the industry and for countries as well to achieve net-zero by 2050, I don't see us achieving this without embracing carbon capture,\" Musabbeh Al Kaabi, ADNOC's executive director of low-carbon solutions, told AFP.\"I would love to see more wind and solar energy, but to be practical and transparent, it's not going to solve the problem.\"Carbon capture was a hot topic at a recent climate tech conference in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi, home of ADNOC.                Drought-hit Spain's water reserves are on average below 50 percent of capacity and levels have fallen to around 25 percent in the worst-hit areas, Andalusia and Catalonia.             Start-ups displayed their advances in carbon capture and storage (CCS) which removes carbon dioxide as it is pumped from power plants and heavy industry.There were also firms presenting their plans for direct air capture (DAC), a newer technology that extracts CO2 directly from the atmosphere.The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says the existing fossil fuel infrastructure\u2014without the use of carbon capture\u2014will push the world beyond the Paris deal's safer global warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.Industrial smokestacksThe debate between whether to primarily target fossil fuels or emissions is shaping up as a key battleground at the COP28 climate talks, which will be held in UAE financial hub Dubai.Citing the IPCC, the COP28 president-designate Sultan Al Jaber\u2014ADNOC's CEO and his country's climate envoy\u2014last week said it was time to \"get serious about carbon capture\".                Carbon capture technology is currently nowhere near the scale needed to make a difference to global emissions, but major oil firms say this is about to change.             But environmentalists are skeptical about the central role that big energy firms are seeking in climate solutions, saying they have a vested interest in maintaining fossil fuel sales.Julien Jreissati, program director at Greenpeace MENA, labeled it a \"distraction\".ADNOC's Kaabi, however, argued that the oil giant's engineering capabilities and deep pockets make them best placed to propel climate tech.\"The world has two options: we could leave it to the small players or have the big players accelerating this decarbonization,\" Kaabi said.In 2016, ADNOC launched the region's first commercial-scale CCS project, Al-Reyadah, which has the capacity to capture 800,000 tons of CO2 per year.Globally, there are only around 35 commercial facilities using carbon capture utilization and storage globally, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), which says even those planned until 2030 would capture only a fraction of the emissions needed.                Temperature anomalies in April.             'We need to move quicker'The entrepreneurs at the UAE conference included Omani company 44.01, a winner of the UK's Earthshot Prize for its technology that permanently removes carbon dioxide from the air by mineralizing it in peridotite rock.\"Climate change is an urgent challenge and for us to be able to tackle that challenge we need to move quicker,\" said CEO Talal Hasan.\"The oil and gas partnerships help us move quickly,\" he told AFP.Hasan's 44.01 has partnered with ADNOC to develop a carbon capture and mineralization site in Fujairah, one of the UAE's seven emirates\u2014the first such project by an energy company in the Middle East.\"In one ton of peridotite, you could probably mineralize 500 to 600 kilos of CO2... this means that with the rocks just in this region, you could potentially mineralize trillions of tons,\" Hasan said.                Aniruddha Sharma, co-founder and CEO of Carbon Clean, which has developed compact technology that captures carbon from industrial smokestacks.             For Hasan, energy firms are good partners because \"we use a lot of the same equipment, infrastructure, people and resources\".\"That will help us accelerate scaling,\" he said, arguing the speed of execution is \"very important\".State-owned Saudi Aramco, one of the world's richest companies, has invested in Carbon Clean, a UK-based firm that has developed compact technology that captures carbon from industrial smokestacks.The firm, which has 49 sites around the world, will deploy its latest technology in the UAE this year\u2014its first project in the Middle East.When asked about the logic of working with big oil, Carbon Clean CEO Aniruddha Sharma said, \"If I was a fireman and there was a fire\u2014a big fire and a small fire\u2014where would I go first?\"Obviously, the big fire.\"    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Gulf oil giants turn to start-ups in carbon-capture bid (2023, May 21)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-gulf-oil-giants-start-ups-carbon-capture.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Air pollution doesn't affect everybody the same way. And in a new study, researchers developed a method to improve estimates of how, within cities, different communities are exposed to fine particulate matter (PM2.5).          Globally, PM2.5 is estimated to cause 4.7 million premature deaths each year, and in the United States, communities of color face the most intense exposure to the chemicals. To estimate levels of exposure to air pollution, the Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP) estimates air quality with fine spatial resolution, especially in densely populated areas. Because the model can assess differences in pollution exposure within cities, it can be useful in designing policies that include environmental justice.However, InMAP overestimates and underestimates specific PM2.5 chemicals: It underestimates particulate sulfate and overestimates particulate ammonium. In a new study, Gallagher and colleagues develop a method to correct those biases.The researchers developed bias correction factors, or scaling factors, for InMAP using measurements of different PM2.5 chemicals. They used pollution monitoring data collected on the ground by the U.S. EPA and satellite data processed by Washington University in St. Louis. Comparing InMAP's predictions with these data sources allowed them to gauge and correct for errors.The authors tested how InMAP with and without scaling factors performed using an established goal of 10% error in its predictions. Without the scaling factors, InMAP underestimated or overestimated PM2.5 concentrations by greater than 10%. Introducing city-specific scaling factors, however, improved model fit and reduced the error below the 10% threshold. In addition, the authors found that their method was most effective in the densest population areas of cities.The authors published all scaling factors for public use and recommend they be used when researching how air pollution differs across race, ethnicity, income, and other demographic traits.

  "text": "Spanish authorities said Saturday that firefighters and soldiers were managing to contain a blaze in the country's west that has forced hundreds of people to evacuate from nearby villages.          \"Today, we're hoping to strike a blow against this fire... It's a very intense task,\" said civil protection coordinator Nieves Villar, adding that conditions had improved as the high wind-speeds of recent days dropped back.That prompted regional forest fire prevention and extinction services to declare the situation \"stabilized\" by late evening.\"The situation with the forest fire in Pinofranqueado is better than yesterday and the change in the weather conditions can help as the hours go by,\" regional government leader Guillermo Fernandez Vara said in a post to social media.Winds are only expected to finally calm on Sunday, when there is the possibility of light rain.Local authorities have blamed arson for the wildfire that broke out Wednesday near the village of Pinofranqueado in the sparsely populated region of Extremadura bordering Portugal.The flames have ravaged some 3,500 hectares (8,500 acres) of forest and scrubland and forced the evacuation of around 700 people from several villages, the regional government said.Data from Europe's Copernicus satellite system showed as much as 12,000 hectares had been affected by the blaze across the affected province of Caceras.Villar said 600 firefighters had been deployed overall, including Portuguese colleagues. Backing them are 14 water-bombing aircraft, the regional agriculture ministry said.Heatwave and droughtFernandez Vara lashed out Friday against the \"bastards\" who had set the fires that caused \"irreversible damages that take decades to recover, if they ever recover\".The strong winds of up to 60 kilometers (35 miles) an hour had made controlling the flames \"extremely difficult\", he added.But he expressed hope Saturday evening that more clement weather conditions in the hours ahead would make it easier to douse the fire.Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez canceled his participation on Friday at a rally in Extremadura ahead of regional elections on May 28 because of the blaze.Spain, which is experiencing long-term drought after three years of below-average rainfall, has already experienced multiple wildfires this year.The drought was made worse by an unusually early heatwave at the end of April that brought exceptionally high temperatures normally seen only in summer.Temperatures hit 38.8 degrees Celsius (101.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in the southern city of Granada on April 27, the highest ever recorded in mainland Spain during that month.In 2022, a particularly bad year for wildfires in Europe, Spain was the continent's worst-hit country.Nearly 500 blazes destroyed more than 300,000 hectares, according to the European Forest Fire Information System.Scientists say human-induced climate change is making extreme weather events including heatwaves and droughts more frequent and more intense. They increase the risk of fires, which emit climate heating greenhouse gases.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Spain says containing wildfire as conditions improve (2023, May 21)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-spain-wildfire-conditions.html  This document is subject to copyright.

Colorado's Department of Public Health and Environment put out alerts and advisories for Saturday afternoon through Sunday afternoon for much of the eastern half of the state, including Denver. It warned that air quality may be unhealthy during that period.\"People with heart or lung disease, older adults, and children should avoid prolonged or heavy exertion; everyone else should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion,\" the department said.Particle pollution led the air quality index along parts of the Front Range to reach 168 on Saturday, the department said. A reading between 151 and 200 indicates unhealthy conditions that can affect sensitive groups as well as some members of the general public.An air quality alert was also in effect Saturday in Montana, with the greatest smoke concentrations in central and eastern parts of the state, according to the Department of Environmental Quality.Utah's Department of Environmental Quality said Friday that it was starting to see the smoke on its monitors in northern and eastern parts of the state.

  "text": "The floods that sent rivers of mud tearing through towns in Italy's northeast are another drenching dose of climate change's all-or-nothing weather extremes, something that has been happening around the globe, scientists say.          The coastal region of Emilia-Romagna was struck twice, first by heavy rain two weeks ago on drought-parched ground that could not absorb it, causing rivers to overflow overnight, followed by this week's deluge that killed 14 and caused damages estimated in the billions of euros.In a changing climate, more rain is coming, but it's falling on fewer days in less useful and more dangerous downpours.The hard-hit Emilia-Romagna region was particularly vulnerable. Its location between the Apennine mountains and the Adriatic Sea trapped the weather system this week that dumped half the average annual amount of rain in 36 hours.\"These are events that developed with persistence and are classified as rare,'' Fabrizio Curcio, the head of Italy's Civil Protection Agency, told reporters.Authorities on Friday said that 43 towns were impacted by flooding and landslides, and that more than 500 roads had been closed or destroyed.Antonello Pasini, a climate scientist at Italy's National Research Council, said a trend had been establishing itself: \"An increase in rainfall overall per year, for example, but a decrease in the number of rainy days and an increase in the intensity of the rain in those few days when it rains,\" he said.

Credit: AP Photo/Luca Bruno, File             Italy's north has been parched by two years of drought, thanks to less-than-average snowfall during the winter months. Melting snow from the Alps, Dolomites and Apennines normally provides the steady runoff through spring and summer that fills Italy's lakes, irrigates the agricultural heartland and keeps the Po and other key rivers and tributaries flowing.Without that normal snowfall in the mountains, plains have gone dry and riverbeds, lakes and reservoirs have receded. They cannot recover even when it rains because the ground is essentially \"impermeable\" and the rain just washes over the topsoil and out to the sea, Pasini said.\"So the drought is not necessarily compensated for by these extreme rains,\" he said, \"Because in northern Italy, the drought depends more on snow being stored in the Alps than on rain. And in the last two years, we have had very little snow.\"Civil Protection Minister Nello Musumeci said the new normal of extreme weather events in the Mediterranean requires Italians to adapt and Italy to rethink its flood protections nationwide. He cited a fierce storm-triggered landslide last fall on the southern island of Ischia, off Naples, that left 12 dead.

Credit: AP Photo/Luca Bruno, File             \"We can't just pretend that nothing is happening,\" he said Thursday. \"Everything must change: the programming in hydraulic infrastructures must change, the engineering approach must change.\"He said those changes were necessary to prevent the types of floods that have left entire towns swamped with mud after two dozen rivers burst their banks.The key going forward is prevention, he said, acknowledging that's not an easy sell due to costs.\"We are not a nation inclined to prevention. We like to rebuild more than to prevent,\" he told Sky TG24.Italy is far from alone in lurching from dry to deluge. California and the United States West sloshed their way from a record-setting megadrought to at least a dozen atmospheric rivers dousing the region with so much rain that a long-dormant lake reappeared.

The panel called heat waves the most obvious, but said heavy precipitation events had also likely increased over most of the world.The U.N. report said \"there is robust evidence\" that record rainfall and one-in-five, one-in-10 and one-in-20 year type rainfall \"became more common since the 1950s.\"    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

  "answer_squad": " Posidonia oceanica",
  "text": "Satellite-derived bathymetry continues to advance and improve rapidly. A recent study has confirmed the effectiveness of a methodology developed to obtain bathymetric data from satellite images in the Western Mediterranean. The results of this research, published in the International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, reaffirm the value of this tool for monitoring coastal areas with varying turbidity levels and diverse seafloor characteristics.          The study was conducted in Cala Millor (Mallorca, Spain), an ecosystem of great significance due to its marine biodiversity but also its potential vulnerability to the effects of global change. The researchers successfully and accurately mapped its coastal seabed using satellite images from the Sentinel-2 twin satellites. This study represents the first attempt to test this methodology in an area with the presence of Posidonia oceanica, an endemic Mediterranean aquatic plant with significant ecological value.This work has been carried out through a collaboration between researchers from the Institute of Marine Sciences of Andalusia (ICMAN-CSIC), the Coastal Observation System of the Balearic Islands (ICTS-SOCIB), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States.\"These tools are a valuable support for coastal management, as they provide up-to-date and continuous information on the morphodynamic changes occurring along the coasts. They are relevant in assisting decision-makers and defining effective adaptation measures against the impacts of global change, ultimately contributing to a more resilient coast,\" explains Sandra Via\u00f1a-Borja, a researcher at the ICMAN-CSIC.Bathymetry, decisive for Marine StrategiesSatellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) is moving a step closer towards consolidating itself as an alternative to traditional bathymetric techniques carried out by aircraft or ships. The main advantage that satellites offer is their open-access data and higher spatial coverage, eliminating the need for physical presence in the area or costly deployments.Nevertheless, despite the substantial advancements achieved in recent years, researchers are confronted with the primary challenge of substantiating the global and operational efficacy and precision of replicating these models in regions characterized by distinct features.This methodology has already been employed with consistent results in other regions of the planet, such as the East Coast of the United States and the Caribbean. Now, it has been evaluated in a different ecosystem, the Mediterranean, where Cala Millor beach is one of the most monitored by the Comprehensive Beach Monitoring System of the ICTS-SOCIB, which has been operating since 2011.Moreover, due to its significance, the European Commission has recently approved a grant for the LIFE AdaptCalaMillor project, aiming to promote the adaptation of this beach to climate change and enhance the resilience of its infrastructure, ecosystems, and services.Generating detailed maps of underwater topography is crucial to support a wide range of activities near the coast, such as dredging, environmental management, planning communication cable and pipeline routes, infrastructure maintenance, hydrographic applications, navigation, aquaculture and fisheries, research, tourism, and recreational sports.Moreover, bathymetry is one of the key features for the formulation of Marine Strategies, as outlined by the directives of the European Commission. This instrumental component establishes the overarching regulatory framework that guides and governs diverse sectoral policies and administrative measures pertaining to the marine environment.\"Currently, we are implementing these tools in other regions such as Galicia (NE Atlantic), South Korea, and Alaska, where we have obtained promising results. It is important to highlight that, according to the International Hydrographic Organization, more than half of the shallow seafloors in our oceans remain unmapped or are outdated. Satellite-derived bathymetry is a free and easily accessible technology. Undoubtedly, it is the future of coastal monitoring,\" emphasizes Isabel Caballero de Frutos, a researcher at ICMAN-CSIC.

  "answer_race": " the changes of extended-range forecasts",
  "question_squad": " What is the horizontal resolution of the extended range forecasts?",
  "answer_squad": " 36 km",
  "text": "In the next upgrade of ECMWF's Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), extended-range forecasts will have 101 instead of 51 ensemble members and will run more frequently than before, at a consistent horizontal resolution of 36 km.          The upgrade from IFS Cycle 47r3 to 48r1 is scheduled to take place on 27 June 2023. The changes lead to improvements in forecast performance across all parameters.ECMWF's extended-range forecasts provide predictions up to 46 days ahead.More ensemble membersThe 51\u2011member ensemble in the current configuration cannot always properly capture small shifts in forecast probabilities. This is true in particular when the signal is very small compared to the ensemble spread.Doubling the ensemble size to 101 ensemble members will provide a more accurate representation of the forecast probability distribution function.In Figure 1, we show an example of the impact of increasing the ensemble size to 101 ensemble members for one of the extended-range forecast products: the probability of tropical cyclone tracks within 300 km over a weekly period, in this case week 4.The charts show that the areas of high probability of tropical cyclone tracks look broadly similar between the 51- and 101\u2011member ensembles, but there are significant differences.For instance, the 101\u2011member ensemble forecast displays higher probabilities of a tropical cyclone strike over the Mozambique Channel and west and northeast of Australia than the 51-member ensemble. It also shows lower probabilities east of 180\u00b0E. In the event, tropical cyclones did strike in the first three locations and did not strike in the fourth.                Fig. 2: Difference of MJO bivariate correlation between 5-member ensemble re-forecasts starting on 1 November and 1 February 1989\u20132016 and re-forecasts starting 3 days earlier. Positive values indicate an improvement resulting from using forecasts without a 3-day delay. The vertical red lines indicate the 90% level of statistical significance. The red, green and cyan curves represent the difference when using a lagged ensemble with more members (respectively days 0 to \u20131; days 0 to \u20132 and days 0 to \u20133). Credit: European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)             Greater frequencyIn Cycle 48r1, extended-range forecasts will run daily rather than twice-weekly. This increased frequency will significantly improve the quality of extended-range forecasts for days of the week other than Monday and Thursday.The impact of the increased frequency can be seen in forecasts of the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO). The MJO is a traveling pattern of variability in the tropical atmosphere which can have strong impacts in the mid-latitudes. It is characterized by an eastward progression of large regions of enhanced and suppressed rainfall.Figure 2 shows an example of the benefit of the increased frequency for the prediction of the MJO (see the blue line). It shows that, by running extended-range forecasts every day, the predictive skill of a forecast produced on Sunday is significantly higher than the predictive skill of a forecast which is three days old (current configuration).The daily frequency will also make it possible to create lagged ensembles, where the forecasts of previous days are combined with the most recent forecasts to produce a larger ensemble. This enables more skilful forecasts overall.The figure shows an example of the benefit of a lagged ensemble for the extended-range prediction of the MJO. The benefit of the lagged ensemble (red, green and cyan curves) increases with lead time. It starts to be visible only after about 10 days of forecasts and becomes substantial in weeks 3 and 4.      Consistent resolutionIn Cycle 48r1, the horizontal resolution will be kept at 36 km for all extended-range predictions. Currently it is 18 km up to day 15 and 36 km up to day 46.The change was motivated by research experiments which did not show any statistically significant impacts resulting from the change in resolution.

  "answer_squad": " The Path to a Sustainable Civilization: Technological, Socioeconomic and Political Change",
  "text": "Collectively, we are driving Earth and civilization towards collapse. Human activities have exceeded planetary boundaries. We are changing the climate, losing biodiversity, degrading land, contaminating freshwater, and damaging the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles upon which we all depend.          We ask how this could happen. Also, why democratically elected governments ignore the wishes of the majority of their people. Why some governments continue to export fossil fuels despite commitments to climate mitigation. Why some go to war in distant lands without any debate in parliament or congress. Why some give tax cuts to the rich while those on the dole struggle below the poverty line.The answers to these questions all come down to one thing: decision-makers and influencers are captured by vested interests. That is the inconvenient truth revealed in our new book, The Path to a Sustainable Civilization: Technological, Socioeconomic and Political Change. But these forces can be overthrown.We argue it is not sufficient for citizen organizations and governments to address specific environmental, social justice and peace issues. It's certainly necessary, but we must also struggle for systemic change. This means challenging the covert driving forces of environmental destruction, social injustice and war, namely, \"state capture\" and the dominant economic system.It's 90 seconds to midnight on the Doomsday Clock, so there's no time to waste.Confronting state capturePolitical scientists and political economists argue governments, public servants, the media and indeed the majority of decision-makers and influencers become captured by vested interests.This is known as state capture, where state means the nation-state. The captors include fossil fuel, armaments, finance, property and gambling industries.State capture can also involve foreign governments. There is justifiable concern in Australia and elsewhere about subversion by the Chinese Communist Party.Yet there is little discussion of the fact that, since 2015, six \"retired\" US admirals worked for the Australian government before the AUKUS announcement on nuclear powered submarines.State capture could explain why Australia's defense is being shifted to the South China Sea under US sovereignty.Confronting state capture involves reversing several undemocratic practices. Of particular concern is the funding of political parties by corporate interests as well as the revolving-door jobs between government and corporate interests.There is also the concentration of media ownership and the influence of so-called \"think tanks\" funded by vested interests.The first step is to set up coalitions or networks to oppose the power of vested interests. This would bring together diverse civil society organizations with common interests in democratic integrity and civil liberties.One example is the Australian Democracy Network, which campaigns for \"changes that make our democracy more fair, open, participatory, and accountable\". The Network was founded in 2020 by the Human Rights Law Centre, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Australian Council of Social Service.      Challenging economic ideologyConventional economic theory failed us when it came to recovery from the Global Financial Crisis of 2007\u201309 and the COVID pandemic. Nevertheless, many governments still accept its prescriptions.The dangerous and destructive myths of conventional economics include the claims that:economic theory can treat the natural environment as an infinite resource and infinite waste dumpendless economic growth on a finite planet is feasible and desirablewealth trickles down from the rich to the poorwell-being and welfare can be measured by GDP government intervention in the market must be avoided. Although these myths have been refuted many times, even by world famous economist Joseph Stiglitz, they still determine much government policy.Australian economist Steve Keen first published Debunking economics in 2001. The financial crisis of 2007 gave him plenty of material for a revised edition in 2011. Richard Denniss gave us Econobabble: How to Decode Political Spin and Economic Nonsense in 2021. Yet, as John Quiggin so eloquently puts it, dead ideas still stalk the land (Zombie Economics.They have devastating impacts on our life support system (the biosphere) and social justice. One of the principal destroyers of our planet is excessive consumption, especially consumption by rich individuals and rich countries.A more appropriate economic framework for human and planetary well-being is the interdisciplinary field of ecological economics.Unlike neoclassical economics, ecological economics gives priority to ecological sustainability and social justice over economic efficiency. It works towards a transition to a steady-state economy. That is, one with no global increase in the use of energy, materials and land, and no increase in population.Since planetary boundaries have already been exceeded and low-income countries must develop, social justice demands that the rich countries undergo planned degrowth.On the pathway to a sustainable civilization, environmental protection and social justice must be addressed together. Because the rich are responsible for the biggest environmental impacts, reducing the gap between rich and poor is critical.Universal basic services such as improved public health, education, housing and transportation\u2014and a government-funded job guarantee\u2014can achieve greater equality and give people incentives to support the transition.Citizen actionWhy would governments free themselves from state capture and discard economics ideology? Former US President Franklin D. Roosevelt once told a delegation: \"OK, you have convinced me. Now get out there and make me do it!\" In other words, pressure from voters is needed to make government action politically feasible.That's why we need citizen-based environmental, social justice, public health and peace groups to form alliances to challenge the overarching issues of state capture and flawed economics ideology.

  "text": "The world is rapidly running out of time on climate change.          For many years, scientists have been warning that the rise in global temperature must be kept to below 1.5\u2070C above pre-industrial levels in order to avoid the worst effects of climate change. However, a new report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reveals that this limit is about to be breached.It estimates there is a 66% chance that global temperatures will breach the 1.5\u2070C limit in the next five years. While it's likely that this will only be temporary as the temperature of the planet naturally fluctuates, it's a warning that the world is getting closer to a time when this will be permanent.Prof. Petteri Taalas, WMO Secretary-General, says, \"While this report does not mean that we will permanently exceed the long-term 1.5\u00b0C level specified in the Paris Agreement, we are sounding the alarm that we will breach the 1.5\u00b0C level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency.\"\"A warming El Ni\u00f1o is expected to develop in the coming months and this will combine with human-induced climate change to push global temperatures into uncharted territory. This will have far-reaching repercussions for health, food security, water management and the environment, and we need to be prepared.\"The report also found that there is a 98% chance that one of the next five years will be the warmest ever recorded, pushing people, wildlife and ecosystems to the brink around the globe.How is the world's temperature predicted to change?At the moment, the average global temperature is about 1.15\u00b0C warmer than it was at the turn of the twentieth century. As the world has become more industrialized over the past century, the increasing emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane have caused the Earth to trap more heat.Rising temperatures have been linked to a variety of effects, including heat waves, storms and other extreme weather. They're also having an impact on our ecosystems, contributing to the melting of the polar ice caps, coral bleaching, and the spread of invasive species.However, the rise in global temperatures is not a straight line. The temperature of the Earth fluctuates naturally over time due to factors such as the strength of the sun and changes in ocean currents.Nevertheless, the average temperature is continuing to rise, and has picked up sharply in recent years. It's not entirely certain why this is the case, but may show that the Earth is approaching climate tipping points, where higher temperatures will be locked in for hundreds or thousands of years.For instance, the oceans have been absorbing excess heat for the past century, but appear to be reaching their limit. A recent report revealed that the oceans are warming more rapidly than ever before, lessening their ability to buffer the climate.This is one of the reasons why the 1.5\u00b0C mark will likely be breached for the first time. It's a significant change from 2015 when the chance of the planet exceeding this temperature were practically zero. This increased to 10% between 2017 and 2021, before rising to 66% for the next five years.While it's likely that this will just be a temporary, there is a one in three chance that the average temperature of the next five years will consistently be above 1.5\u00b0C. Without urgent change, it's likely that this will be permanent by 2034.Dr. Leon Hermanson, a Met Office expert scientist who led the report, says, \"Global mean temperatures are predicted to continue increasing, moving us further and further away from the climate we are used to.\"\"These new highs will be fueled almost completely by the rise of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but the anticipated development of the naturally occurring El Nino event will also release heat from the tropical Pacific.\"      The difficult route to 1.5\u00b0CWhile the outlook may seem bleak, the ability to turn things around is within our grasp.A recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that while it is difficult, a pathway to 1.5\u00b0C is still a possibility. To achieve this, emissions need to be halved within the next seven years.Developed nations will need to reach net zero by 2040\u201410 years earlier than current goals\u2014and phase out fuels such as coal by the end of the decade.The main way to ensure this is to change how our energy systems are funded. Subsides for fossil fuels need to be rapidly replaced with equivalents for green energy, while investment needs to be driven into storage technologies that can even out unpredictable sources of renewable power.Money also needs to be found for research into negative emissions technology, such as carbon capture, to bring down levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. To keep the goal of 1.5\u00b0C alive, the capacity of this technology needs to be eight times greater than it is at the moment.While developed countries start making cuts immediately, they also need to provide a much greater level of investment to developing nations so that they can do the same. Almost all coal, oil and natural gas needs to be left in the ground to keep within the world's carbon budget, so no country can be left behind.Though the main changes needed to limit climate change must come from governments and politicians, there are also ways individuals can contribute. Taking fewer flights, eating less meat, and making homes more energy efficient can all make a small but valuable difference in the fight against rising temperatures.

  "text": "Tackling threats to water supply in European highlands is crucial for producers of premium foods and drinks ranging from Spanish ham to Scotch whisky.          Marian Navas is at the sharp end of a major European challenge: ensuring that small-scale farmers can cope with the impact of climate change.For Navas, a Spanish native who makes prized Iberian ham, and other traditional agricultural producers in Europe's mountain regions, the test boils down to water. Can they count on having enough of it as global warming triggers more frequent droughts?High stakesThe answer to this question may determine whether mountain areas, which cover more than a third of Europe's land surface, remain viable contributors to EU economic, social and cultural life. In the case of Navas and numerous others, family history is also on the line.\"Pig farming is a business that has been the livelihood of many families, including my own, for decades,\" she said. \"Any business that is undertaken comes with challenges and, for those directly linked to nature, climate change is an additional one.\"The threat to supplies of water needed by businesses in mountain zones from Spain to Scotland is a prime focus of the EU-funded MOVING project. The four-year initiative, which runs through August 2024, is assessing the vulnerabilities of highland agriculture and mapping whole supply chains for insights to inform new policies and give long-term answers.\"After two years, it is very clear that one of the most important threats is from climate change,\" said Professor Mar Delgado, who coordinates MOVING from the University of Cordoba in Spain. \"Higher temperatures and more droughts mean less snow and less water. People are worried.\"But people like Navas also appear determined to tackle the challenges being addressed by MOVING.Also on the project's radar is the production of foods including cheese such as Portugal's Serra da Estrela, Italy's Caciocavallo from the Alto Molise region and Switzerland's T\u00eate de Moine; lamb from France's Val de Dr.\u00f4me area as well as the Austrian and Serbian Alps; carob powder\u2014used in bread\u2014from the Greek island of Crete; chestnut flour from the French isle of Corsica and northern Italy; and drinks like Alto Douro wine from Portugal and Scotch malt whisky.Ensuring that such activities persist would respond to growing consumer calls for less intensive agriculture and would reinforce Europe's economic, social and cultural richness.In contrast to factory farming, this type of ancestral mountain agriculture is more respectful of nature and even embraces it. Indeed, such producers form an integral part of the European landscape.      Acorn-fed pigsIberian ham, or Jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico, is a prime example of the economic and environmental issues at stake. Special production features give the ham a distinctive nuttiness, sweetness and tenderness, a protected designation of origin (PDO) label and a premium price.Spain has four protected designations of origin for Iberian ham, which comes from southern and western areas of the country. The PDO system involves regulations to guarantee the meat's origin, production methods and particular characteristics.MOVING covers the smallest PDO, Los Pedroches, whose ham is produced from black pigs that feed on acorns, insects and grass in pastures in the Sierra Morena mountain range of southern Spain.The combination of diet and roaming leads to a large amount of fat in the meat. A long curing process then allows development of the qualities that make the ham a delicacy.Yet the water requirements for growing acorns and breeding pigs are putting an increasing strain on the sector, particularly traditional producers, according to Juan Luis Ortiz, secretary general of the Los Pedroches PDO.\"Water is now one of the great limitations of our pastures, specifically for the production of acorns,\" said Ortiz. \"Besides, pigs drink about 10 liters of water a day. The main challenge is the collection of water and its storage and, secondly, the optimization of its use to eliminate losses.\"Some pig farmers in Spain are placing canopies over ponds from which the animals drink to prevent evaporation\u2014an increasingly widespread technique in European hillside agriculture, according to Delgado.\"Small ponds covered with plastics to avoid water loss are also becoming common in other places,\" she said.Winemaker's soil strategyFor Luca Pedron, agronomy head at sparkling wine producer Ferrari in Italy's northern region of Trento, water scarcity has been a growing concern since a dry summer in 2003 hampered grape production.The alert, he said, was reinforced in 2022 when a very dry year along with unusually high temperatures hurt the quantity and quality of grapes.\"What we harvested was low in sugar content and poor in terms of acidity\u2014exactly what we need to avoid to obtain a good quality wine,\" Pedron said. \"What worries us nowadays is the reduced rainfall and snowfall with, at the same time, long periods of high temperatures.\"He said one response from wine producers is to increase the organic matter in soil so it becomes more fertile and, as a result, can store more water.Covering the soil, deepening root penetration and using lighter machinery wherever possible are part of the overall answer, according to Pedron.\"It is a strategy composed of several actions, all aiming at better soil fertility and more developed root systems,\" he said.Mountain chainsMOVING has evaluated the production systems and vulnerabilities in each of the 23 regions covered by the project. With 15 months still to run, it plans to deliver a roadmap of policies needed to improve the resilience and sustainability of European mountain areas.To stick to the example of Iberian ham, this exercise will mean assessing the steps starting with pig breeding and continuing through processing, marketing, distribution and consumption in, say, a specialized delicatessen in Berlin, Paris or New York.\"We need consumers ready to pay the high value of this product so the caring of the pastures, the pigs and the mountain areas can be made sustainable,\" Delgado said. \"If you want these territories to be alive, you need people working there.\"Spain has around 4 000 farms that raise Iberian pigs, which number fewer than 400 000\u2014a fraction of the country's total pig population of around 34 million. The Iberian-ham business is oriented to markets abroad.Exports last year were worth more than \u20ac500 million, according to Spanish trade agency ICEX. Around three-quarters of these shipments were to other European countries including France, Germany, Italy and Portugal, while top overseas consumers included the US, Mexico and China.Producer prideMountain regions provide plenty of public goods including water, clean air and scenery that could justify government aid for highland farming, according to Delgado.Nonetheless, she says the other underlying strength of these areas is the local and skilled workforce committed to protecting the land and keen to show that this type of agriculture can increasingly influence consumer demand.\"They want to have a job, an income and a livelihood,\" said Delgado.Navas is proof of the point, expressing a determination to thrive in small-scale pig farming with the help of various possible practical improvements. These include water collection and storage systems to take advantage of rainfall throughout the year and training of farm workers to ensure proper pruning of groves and soil conditions for trees.She said that, apart from the ultimate results that will emerge, MOVING has already been beneficial by bringing together a variety of professionals from across Europe who have enriched her thinking about the way ahead.\"This project is having a very positive impact on my perspective of the future in this sector,\" Navas said.

  "text": "Micro and nanoplastics are pervasive in our food supply and may be affecting food safety and security on a global scale, a new study led by CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, has found.          The study is one of the first to analyze the academic literature on microplastics from a food safety and food security risk viewpoint, building on past studies which primarily tracked plastics in fish.It shows that plastics and their additives are present at a range of concentrations not only in fish but in many products including meat, chicken, rice, water, take-away food and drink, and even fresh produce.CSIRO analytical chemist, food safety specialist and lead author of the paper, Dr. Jordi Nelis, said these plastics enter the human food chain through numerous pathways, such as ingestion as shown in the fish studies, but one of the main ways is through food processing and packaging. The research is published in the journal TrAC Trends in Analytical Chemistry.\"Fresh food for example can be plastic free when it's picked or caught but contain plastics by the time it's been handled, packaged and makes its way to us,\" Dr. Nelis said.\"Machinery, cutting boards, plastic wrapping can all deposit micro and nanoplastics onto our food that we then consume. This study highlights the need to understand what plastic could end up in food to manage food safety and security,\" he said.Another important pathway for these contaminants to enter our agriculture system is through biosolids sourced from wastewater treatment.Biosolids are a rich fertilizer for agricultural land, but they can contain plastic particles from many sources, such as from the washing of synthetic clothing.These particles could build up in the soil and change the soil structure over time, which may affect crop production, food security and ecosystem resilience. For example, plastic materials can \"trick\" the good bacteria in the soil into thinking they are the roots of plants, meaning the plants end up with less of the nutrients they need.The study also discussed how additives in plastics that help make plastic work in our modern world can leach into our environment, potentially contaminating our food supply. Additives that make plastic flexible or resistant to UV radiation, for example, can include flame retardants, heavy metals, phthalates, hardeners or other chemical compounds.There are currently no definitive studies that demonstrate micro and nanoplastics in the environment cause harm to humans, however more research is needed to fully understand health effects.More research is also needed to better understand the effects of plastics and their additives on food safety and security as well as to develop better analytical techniques to monitor, assess and establish safe levels in food, drinking water and agroecosystems.\"The key missing information is determining safe levels of microplastics. We currently don't know exactly what the microplastic flux through the food system is or which levels can be considered safe,\" Dr. Nelis said.He said there are things that consumers can do to help reduce micro and nanoplastics from cycling through the environment.\"On average Australians discard 100 kg of plastic waste each year, so use fewer plastics especially in the kitchen and wash your clothes a little less often, on shorter cycles,\" Dr. Nelis said.CSIRO is on a mission to end plastic waste, with a goal of an 80% reduction in plastic waste entering the Australian environment by 2030.

  "text": "Reduce fossil fuel use and air quality will improve, right? It might not be as straightforward as it appears, according to a Penn State-led research team. They explored almost 30,000 simulated future scenarios and found that some climate mitigation efforts could lead to harmful health impacts in certain geographic areas.          Their results were published May 18 in Nature Sustainability.\"In general, reducing fossil fuel use is good for climate mitigation and good for cleaning up the air, and the modeling studies have always found health benefits from climate mitigation,\" said corresponding author Wei Peng, assistant professor of international affairs and of civil and environmental engineering at Penn State, who has conducted research in this area for a decade. \"But in this study, for the first time, we were able to see potential co-harm occur in a certain part of the scenarios.\"The researchers found some scenarios where fossil fuel reduction requires a significant land use change to grow bioenergy resources, such as algae and plants like corn stalks and barley straw that can be used to create biofuels including types of ethanol and biodiesel.In these scenarios, deforestation could occur on a grander scale for certain areas, such as Russia and Canada, leading to worsening air quality. As a result, people in these areas with worsened air quality could suffer from more respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, which could lead to more premature deaths, said the researchers.The researchers obtained these results by using an exploratory ensemble approach, which samples several variables at different levels \u2014for example, carbon emissions at different levels of emission\u2014to obtain an understanding of the breadth of potential future scenarios.\"Instead of using narrative-based scenarios, which tend to ask questions such as, 'What if we have a high inequality world?' or 'What if we have a low carbon development world?' we developed a large ensemble of scenarios,\" said first author Xinyuan Huang, a doctoral student in the Penn State Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. \"This approach couples models of climate, energy and health to explore a wide range of plausible futures.\"In this assessment, the researchers modeled the energy and land system changes for 32 geopolitical regions based on the Global Change Analysis Model, an open-source integrated assessment model. They then conducted the air quality and health impact assessment for nearly 200 countries.Peng said that since the future is deeply uncertain, the likelihood of potential future scenarios that involve health co-harms are unknown, but their findings demonstrate the possibilities of unintended consequences of climate mitigation.\"What I find especially useful is that now we can start to think about the levers we have, and how we can use them to mitigate harmful impacts and to embrace the benefits,\" she said. \"If we go for the bioenergy-heavy future, then we really need to pay attention to how we manage land.\"Levers for mitigating harmful impacts could include different approaches to any necessary deforestation, according to Peng. She said that clear cutting instead of burning, for example, still allows unavoidable deforestation but lessens the impact on air quality.For next steps, the researchers plan to assess the impacts at an even finer geographic resolution.\"If we want to learn more about energy system changes and the resulting distribution of health impacts, we need more analysis at the finer resolution,\" Huang said. \"For example, we are now working on a new scenario ensemble at the state and county level for the United States, so that it could be more informative for policymakers.\" More information:Xinyuan Huang et al, Effects of global climate mitigation on regional air quality and health, Nature Sustainability (2023).

  "text": "New research from Queen Mary University of London shows that only around 13% of global methane emissions are regulated, despite methane emissions causing at least 25% of current global warming.          The global review, published on May 19 in One Earth, also found that little is known about the effectiveness of the policies that exist, with potentially unrepresentative methane emission estimations used rather than actual measurements. Inaccurate estimations can also mean the issue is taken less seriously by decision-makers by masking its severity.The researchers argue that the lack of regulation and clarity into their impact must urgently be addressed if we are to meet our global climate targets. The review suggests a consistent approach worldwide with robust quantification and reporting could unlock new opportunities to drastically reduce global warming levels.To meet the Paris Agreement 1.5\u00b0C objective, man-made methane emissions should be reduced by at least 40%\u201345% by 2030, compared to the 2020 levels. Methane mitigation is not only a cost-effective strategy to reduce global warming but could also improve the air quality. Today methane emissions are increasing faster than at any time since the 1980s.                Most methane emissions come from the agriculture, energy, and waste sectors, and only about 13% of cumulative methane emissions are covered by policy. Credit: One Earth/Olczak et al.             This global review of methane policies is the first to systematically look at all major man-made emission sources, agriculture, energy and waste. Researchers focused on 281 policies worldwide, 255 of them currently in force, that aim to monitor and reduce methane emissions examining the geographical coverage, strength and effectiveness of the policies.Of identified national policies, 90% have been adopted in three regions: North America (39%), Europe (30%) and Asia Pacific (21%). Globally, the research shows there has been a gradual increase in methane policies since 1974. But fossil methane policies, e.g., targeting emissions from coal, oil and gas sectors tend to be less stringent than those targeting biogenic methane sources, especially in the waste sector.In jurisdictions with fossil methane policies in place, further mitigation opportunities include emissions further along the supply chain, e.g., emissions from Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) carrier ships, which were investigated by a team of QMUL researchers led by Dr. Balcombe.      One of the main challenges to measuring methane emissions is accurately identifying and quantifying sources. Developing and using technologies such as satellites to monitor methane emissions can help policymakers with measurement, verification, compliance and detection of super-emitters. Introducing policies with greater policy coverage, mitigation solutions including for major sources, and measurable objectives could lead to a significant methane emissions reduction.Maria Olczak, lead researcher on this project from Queen Mary University of London, said, \"Methane reduction is still perceived as a choice rather than a necessary step alongside CO2 reduction to combat global warming. And with so many different sources, there needs to be stronger social support and the political will to act.\"Our review highlights the value of setting policies that are predictable and clear for the industry. They will aid effective investment decisions aligned with the long-term climate mitigation goals, including the decrease in emission intensity and in production across developed and developing economies.\"Dr. Paul Balcombe, study author and Senior Lecturer in Chemical Engineering at Queen Mary, said, \"It's shocking to see that most methane emissions aren't regulated when they contribute heavily to global warming today, although accurately monitoring emissions is not easy. Our chances of reaching global climate targets are slim if this goes unchecked.\"The good news is that there's an enormous opportunity to limit warming in the short term if we act fast to get on top of methane emissions. We urgently need tighter regulation on better monitoring of methane and concrete actions towards reduction measures.\"Andris Piebalgs, study author, part-time Professor at the Florence School of Regulation and a former EU Commissioner for Energy, said, \"Over the last few years, we have seen growing attention to methane thanks to multilateral initiatives such as the International Methane Emissions Observatory and the Global Methane Pledge. The European Union and the U.S. EPA are now working to finalize ambitious regulations targeting methane emissions in the energy sector. I hope that the upcoming COP28 and the first Global Stocktake will make the policymakers across the world realize that methane mitigation is an effective way to enhance their climate commitments.\" More information:A global review of methane policies reveals only 13% of emissions are covered with unclear effectiveness, One Earth (2023).

  "answer_squad": " Science",
  "text": "A team of atmospheric and climatic scientists from several institutions in Europe has found that even if all human management of forestry land stopped immediately, it would not be sufficient to offset global carbon emissions. In their study, reported in the journal Science, the group used mapping and AI applications to model how much forest regrowth, and by extension, sequestration of CO2, would occur under such a plan.          For several years, many large corporations have tried to mange their carbon footprint by dealing in carbon offsets and credits, paying others to engage in activities that remove CO2 from the atmosphere, theoretically, offsetting the emissions they emit. The biggest customers in such deals are those who manage large forests, such as portions of the Amazon. But there is a flaw in this system, the researchers contend\u2014putting land back to use as forest will not be sufficient to overcome the problem of climate change.To learn more about the impact of ceasing forest usage, including cutting and other types of forest management, the research team combined global maps depicting forestry biomass in both managed and natural forests as a means for determining current conditions. They then applied machine-learning applications to look at historical forest growth as a means for predicting new natural growth for forests around the globe.They were able to calculate the increase in global forestry biomass that would occur if human forestry activities stopped\u2014it came to ~44.1 petagrams of carbon. The team points out that would mean a 15% to 16% increase in carbon storage\u2014about four years' worth of current CO2 emissions. Thus, allowing the forests to grow back naturally would not be enough to stop the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere and thus, climate change.As part of their work, the team also found that 1.6 million km2 of land would need to be reforested to compensate for just one year's worth of CO2 emissions. Put another way, that would be a piece of land approximately the size of Alaska. More information:Caspar T. J.

The residents weren't the only ones keeping a close eye on the towering peak. Every time there is a sigh, tic or heave in Popocatepetl, there are dozens of scientists, a network of sensors and cameras, and a roomful of powerful equipment watching its every move.The 17,797-foot (5,426-meter) volcano, known affectionately as \"El Popo,\" has been spewing toxic fumes, ash and lumps of incandescent rock persistently for almost 30 years, since it awakened from a long slumber in 1994.The volcano is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of Mexico City, but looms much closer to the eastern fringes of the metropolitan area of 22 million people. The city also faces threats from earthquakes and sinking soil, but the volcano is the most visible potential danger\u2014and the most closely watched. A severe eruption could cut off air traffic, or smother the city in clouds of choking ash.Ringed around its summit are six cameras, a thermal imaging device and 12 seismological monitoring stations that operate 24 hours a day, all reporting back to an equipment-filled command center in Mexico City.

Credit: AP Photo/Marco Ugarte, File             A total of 13 scientists from a multidisciplinary team take turns staffing the command center around the clock. Being able to warn of an impending ash cloud is key, because people can take precautions. Unlike earthquakes, warning times can be longer for the volcano and in general the peak is more predictable.On a recent day, researcher Paulino Alonso made the rounds, checking the readings at the command center run by Mexico's National Disaster Prevention Center, known by its initials as Cenapred. It is a complex task that involves seismographs that measure the volcano's internal trembling, which could indicate hot rock and gas moving up the vents in the peak.Monitoring gases in nearby springs and at the peak\u2014and wind patterns that help determine where the ash could be blown\u2014also play a role.The forces inside are so great that they can temporarily deform the peak, so cameras and sensors must monitor the very shape of the volcano.

Authorities came up with the simple idea of a volcano \"stoplight\" with three colors: green for safety, yellow for alert and red for danger.For most of the years since the stoplight was introduced, it has been stuck at some stage of \"yellow.\" The mountain sometimes quiets down, but not for long. It seldom shoots up molten lava: instead it's more the \"explosive\" type, showering out hot rocks that tumble down its flanks and emitting bursts of gas and ash.

  "answer_squad": " GHG inventories",
  "text": "Limited accuracy and transparency of national greenhouse gas emission inventories are curbing climate action, especially in the agriculture and land use sector.          Inconsistent and inadequate reporting by low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), uncertainties in reported data, and a lack of robust activity data and locally specific emission factors have been found to curb effective policy action. GHG inventories are the foundation for accounting and tracking progress toward mitigation goals and decision-makers must have access to reliable, legible, and consistent data to make informed decisions.A review of UNFCCC country-reported agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) data and three independent global databases provides an in-depth analysis and inventory of reporting issues that affect national GHG inventories. Inventories were characterized by quality and consistency aiming to enable better use of data and tracking progress toward climate change mitigation goals.Results show a gap in LMIC reporting in the UNFCCC data, highlighting a need for more uniform reporting methodologies, especially to manage food security and climate change adaptation and mitigation. Policy and decision-makers should therefore use independent, non-UNFCCC emissions databases to triangulate UNFCCC data for emissions-related decisions.Lead author Kyle Dittmer explained that \"other analyses show a general lack of quality in UNFCCC reporting. UNFCCC-reported data should be the most official, but it's often the most incomplete and is sometimes illegible. We identified specific areas to improve consistency.\" Some examples of what affected the quality of countries' reports included mistakes and a lack of reporting numbers, inconsistent global warming potentials, and legibility.The authors give recommendations for how inventories can be enhanced to drive progress toward goals instead of limiting action. Dittmer also said that \"developed nations must intensify their technical and financial support to LMICs to create and maintain institutional capacity, tools, and training for preparing accurate and transparent national GHG inventories.\"Developed nations cannot continue to fall short of their climate-finance pledges. Ambitious financial and technical support for LMICs is needed to fulfill the commitment wealthy nations made to the Paris Agreement so that decision-makers can accurately track progress, set mitigation priorities, and manage emissions.The research is published in Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems.

  "text": "Sensors that detect changes in atmospheric pressure due to ground shaking can also obtain data about large earthquakes and explosions that exceed the upper limit of many seismometers, according to new research.          The sensors, which detect inaudible infrasounds carried through the air, could improve tsunami warnings and other emergency responses while also lowering costs.Research by University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute scientists shows that infrasound sensors can improve magnitude determinations. An initial tsunami warning is based solely on estimated magnitude and location.Infrasound sensors cost less than seismometers, are reliable and exist in large numbers in Alaska for other uses.\"What we've done is use infrasound for a purpose it wasn't really intended for,\" said Ken Macpherson at the Geophysical Institute's Wilson Alaska Technical Center.\"We've found that it works well for providing complete data about strong earthquakes.\"These pressure-sensing infrasound instruments are generally used for non-seismic purposes such as the detection of mining explosions or nuclear detonations. They also record landslides, erupting volcanoes or meteors entering Earth's atmosphere.Macpherson details the use of infrasound sensors for seismology in a research paper published April 21 in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America.Macpherson is a seismo-acoustic research and operations scientist. Others from the Wilson Alaska Technical Center involved in the research include Director David Fee, data specialist Juliann Coffey and machine-learning specialist Alex Witsil, now working in the private sector.Infrasound sensors record changes in air pressure caused by infrasound waves, which are at a frequency below what humans can hear.Infrasound sensors can register the full range of an earthquake's ground motion by detecting air pressure changes caused by the ground's up and down movement during an earthquake.Upward movement of the ground compresses the air, increasing air pressure much like a piston does. Downward movement reduces the pressure.Pressure changes from even the largest earthquakes are far below infrasound sensors' upper limit.      In contrast, seismometers, which record the actual movement of the ground, have an upper limit, meaning top-end data can be absent for large earthquakes. They can also miss data of smaller earthquakes if those occur too close to a seismometer.Seismologists call that data loss \"clipping.\"\"If you crank up your stereo too high, you get a horrible sound,\" Macpherson said. \"That means you've exceeded the dynamic range of the speaker. That can happen to a seismometer.\"Seismologists can overcome clipping by deploying strong-motion detectors, which are different from infrasound sensors. These motion sensors won't go off scale during intense shaking but are costly and aren't accurate for smaller quakes. About 130 are located around Alaska, mostly in urban areas and near known faults.As one example, Macpherson and his colleagues compared infrasound data of the magnitude 7.1 Anchorage earthquake of Nov. 30, 2018, to data from a seismometer. Both instruments were in the same location 18.6 miles from the epicenter.\"The seismometer recording of that earthquake went right to the dynamic range of the instrument and stopped,\" Macpherson said. \"So there's a loss of amplitude information.\"The seismometer was one of several in the Southcentral Alaska region missing top-end data from that earthquake. Data from the infrasound sensor was not clipped.To check the accuracy of the infrasound monitor's top-end data, Macpherson matched it against the data from a strong-motion seismometer at the same location. They matched.Infrasound sensors can also provide data just as timely as seismometers. That's especially important if a tsunami is possible. The National Tsunami Warning Center has just four minutes to issue a warning from the time of a quake's occurrence.\"If all of the close seismometers clip, and the Tsunami Warning Center is trying to get an accurate magnitude for warning of a tsunami, they could quickly compute magnitudes from a nearby infrasound station that's colocated with a seismometer,\" Coffey said.Alaska has about 150 infrasound sensors alongside seismic monitors throughout the state.Some of these were part of the EarthScope Transportable Array, a project funded by the National Science Foundation to map Earth's crust and upper mantle. The temporary array moved gradually across the nation, reaching Alaska in 2014. Ninety-six of these stations are now part of the Alaska Earthquake Center's permanent monitoring network.\"We have this unique resource in Alaska, and we're pushing the science to get the most out of it that we can,\" Macpherson said. \"We're looking to utilize it in novel ways.\" More information:Kenneth A.

  "answer_race": " A new tool for forest disturbance detection",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the method that combines the strengths of a time series and a 2-date?",
  "answer_squad": " TSUN",
  "text": "Every second, the planet loses a stretch of forest equivalent to a football field due to logging, fires, insect infestation, disease, wind, drought, and other factors. In a recently published study, researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center presented a comprehensive strategy to detect when and where forest disturbance happens at a large scale and provide a deeper understanding of forest change.          The study was published in the Journal of Remote Sensing.\"Our strategy leads to more accurate land cover mapping and updating,\" said Suming Jin, a physical scientist with the EROS Center.To understand the big picture of a changing landscape, scientists rely on the National Land Cover Database, which turns Earth-observation satellite (Landsat) images into pixel-by-pixel maps of specific features. Between 2001 and 2016, the database showed that nearly half of the land cover change in the contiguous United States involved forested areas.\"To ensure the quality of National Land Cover Database land cover and land cover change products, it is important to accurately detect the location and time of forest disturbance,\" said Jin.Jin and team developed a method to detect forest disturbance by year. The approach combines strengths from a time-series algorithm and a 2-date detection method to improve large-region operational mapping efficiency, flexibility, and accuracy. The new technique facilitates more effective forest management and policy, among other applications.Landsat data have been widely used to detect forest disturbance because of their long history, high spatial and radiometric resolutions, free and open data policy, and suitability for creating continental or even global mosaic images for different seasons.\"We need algorithms that can create consistent large-region forest disturbance maps to assist producing multi-epoch National Land Cover Database,\" said Jin. \"We also need those algorithms to be scalable so we can track forest change over longer periods of time.\"A commonly employed method called \"2-date forest change detection\" involves comparing images from two different dates while the \"time-series algorithm\" can provide observations for yearly or even monthly Landsat time series.In general, 2-date forest change detection algorithms are more flexible than time-series methods and use richer spectral information. The 2-date method can easily determine changes between image bands, indices, classifications, and combinations and, therefore, detect forest disturbances more accurately. However, the 2-date method only detects changes for one time period and usually requires additional information or further processing to separate forest changes from other land cover changes.      On the other hand, time-series-based forest change detection algorithms can use spectral and long-term temporal information and produce changes for multiple dates simultaneously. However, these methods usually require every step of the time series algorithm to be processed again when a new date is added, which can be cumbersome for continuous monitoring updates and lead to inconsistencies.Previous studies proposed ensemble approaches to improve forest change mapping accuracy, including \"stacking,\" or combining the output of different mapping methods. While stacking reduces omission and commission error rates, the method is computationally intensive and requires reference data for training.Jin and team's approach combined strengths from 2-date change detection methods and the continuous time-series change detection method, which was called the Time-Series method Using Normalized Spectral Distance (NSD) index (TSUN), to improve large-region operational mapping efficiency, flexibility, and accuracy. Using this combination, the researchers produced the NLCD 1986\u20132019 forest disturbance product, which shows the most recent forest disturbance date between the years 1986 and 2019 for every two-to-three-year interval.\"The TSUN index detects multi-date forest land cover changes and was shown to be easily extended to a new date even when new images were processed in a different way than previous date images,\" Jin said.The research team plans to improve the tool by increasing the time frequency and produce an annual forest disturbance product from 1986 to present.\"Our ultimate goal is to automatically produce forest disturbance maps with high accuracy with the capability of continually monitoring forest disturbance, hopefully in real-time,\" Jin said.

  "answer_race": " The battle for justice for the toxic water on Camp Lejeune.",
  "question_squad": " What was the name of the woman who died after a miscarriage?",
  "answer_squad": " Joan Palumbo",
  "text": "Joan Palumbo wasn't told the danger she was in when she stepped under the showerhead in her bathroom in Jacksonville, North Carolina.          She wasn't told about the toxins mixing into her daughter's food every time she blended formula with water from the kitchen sink.Or that cooking her own food in that same water would eventually lead to her death.Palumbo didn't know that beginning in 1953 toxic chemicals had begun seeping through the ground into two of the eight water treatment plants on Camp Lejeune, the Marine Corps base near Jacksonville where she and her husband, Fred, lived in the Tarawa Terrace neighborhood.Trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, benzene and vinyl chloride, deadly chemicals known to cause health problems including miscarriages, birth defects, cancers and childhood leukemia, leaked from underground fuel storage tanks, an off-base dry cleaning facility, industrial area spills and waste disposal sites. The contamination of the base's waters continued through 1987 and mostly affected the Tarawa Terrace and Hadnot Point neighborhoods.It is estimated that more than 1 million people were likely exposed to the toxic waters on Camp Lejeune. Beginning in August, half of those people had filed claims asking for the government to make right what happened to its Marines and their families\u2014but no offers from the government have been extended. And without those offers, the claimants have been forced into litigation\u2014potentially for years\u2014if they want justice.Palumbo is among those people. The Palumbos moved in 1962 to Camp Lejeune and together had their first child. Fred deployed overseas in 1963.Subtle signs include miscarriage, premature birthsThe first signs of trouble for the Palumbo family from drinking Lejeune's water were subtle. While Fred was serving across the world from his wife, Joan suffered a miscarriage.That same year, Joan became pregnant, this time with twin daughters. They were born three months premature, and entered the world fighting for their lives. The Palumbos' daughter, Kristine, died after three days, on New Year's Day. Her sister's fight continued for six long months before she was able to leave the hospital and join the rest of her family at home.The Palumbos went on to have six children, and it seemed that tragedy had left them.When their youngest entered grade school, Joan Palumbo returned to her job as a pediatric nurse. She would eventually become a psychiatric nurse. Fred continued serving in the Marines until retiring in August 1981.      Less than subtle signs? Breast cancer, multiple myelomaThen, in 1997, Joan's own health took a drastic turn. Her husband calls it her \"medical nightmare.\"Breast cancer led to a lumpectomy in her right breast.Another lump in her left breast led to a bilateral mastectomy.Then she needed a spinal fusion.A new diagnosis: multiple myeloma.She had a mitral valve in her heart replaced.Then she went into renal failure.If all of that wasn't bad enough, she was inflicted with shingles before her death in January 2011.Learning about Camp Lejeune's contaminated waterFred Palumbo told McClatchy he and his wife pored through her family's medical history. Heart problems and cancer weren't part of their story. Nothing made sense.\"We couldn't determine what the problem was,\" Palumbo said. \"And I didn't realize there was a problem until after she died.\"He can't remember exactly how he learned about the water contamination. He believes it was a news segment on television that led him to connect with Jerry Ensminger.Ensminger, a retired Marine, has become the face of the fight for justice for those who lived and worked on Camp Lejeune. Ensminger lost his 9-year-old daughter born on the base, Janey, to leukemia in 1986.Ensminger led efforts to uncover what happened with the water on the North Carolina base, hold the government accountable for covering up the contamination and ensure that no one who served at Camp Lejeune was left in the dark.Fighting for justice and the PACT ActEnsminger spent decades traveling to Washington fighting for the government to take responsibility for what happened to his fellow Marines at Camp Lejeune.In 2012, President Barack Obama signed into law the Janey Ensminger Act, which ensured family members of veterans who lived on Camp Lejeune during the years of the water contamination had access to health care.Last summer, Ensminger's \"Oorah,\" the Marine's battle cry, echoed in the Senate chamber when Congress passed the PACT Act, giving anyone exposed to and affected by the water on Camp Lejeune two years to file claims with the U.S. Navy. The bill also allowed service members to file claims if they were exposed during specific dates to burn pits\u2014a form of waste disposal that can give off toxic fumes\u2014or had illnesses connected to service in the Gulf War, southwest Asia or the Vietnam War.More than 500,000 claims have been filed because of the PACT Act, Biden announced on April 26.The claims detail when someone was on the base, their exposure to the water and what health issues they developed.The Navy can then do one of three things: offer a settlement, deny the claim or do nothing.If a settlement is offered, the person filing the claim can then accept it or litigate it.If an offer isn't made within six months or the claim is denied, then the person can pursue litigation.Attorneys work with victims to file lawsuitsIn February, when Camp Lejeune victims could first file lawsuits, a name repeatedly popped up on the court documents: attorney Eric Flynn with Bell Law Group, a firm out of South Carolina, who has since opened an office in Raleigh to help handle the Camp Lejeune claims.\"I couldn't be prouder to represent these clients,\" Flynn told McClatchy. \"These people have suffered tremendously and I think it only takes talking to a handful of them, hearing their stories to hear the suffering they went through.\"Bell Law Group's namesake, Edward Bell, began working with victims of Camp Lejeune more than 15 years ago. In the beginning, Flynn's firm tried to sue over the effects of the water, but ran into two hurdles: a time limit for how long after exposure someone could sue, and the government's immunity.Until the PACT Act, the law firm ran into roadblock after roadblock to get their clients justice.Flynn can rattle off their stories with ease: the women who suffered miscarriages while their husbands fought in Vietnam, the members of the military who developed neurological effects, the Marine with Parkinson's, the wife with multiple sclerosis. The divorces as medical problems and losses became too much for a couple to handle. The missing faces at family gatherings.\"There have been times where I think any attorney that has talked to these folks have walked out in tears because what these people have gone through is horrible,\" Flynn said. \"To be able to fight for these folks, to be able to bring their claims and hold people accountable is extremely gratifying.\"Civil case could become largest in US historyFlynn said that while the government lost sovereign immunity and the time limit constraints, officials still have a lot of arguments they can make.He said he won't predict what they'll do, but they could raise challenges based on the government's liability, on whether the water caused someone's health issues, or on the length of time they were exposed.\"On top of that, we still have to go through the process of getting experts to review all the documents, picking the jury, getting in front of the jury, convincing the jury of our case,\" Flynn said.Catherine Dunham, a professor of law at Elon Law School, told McClatchy that the largest civil case in U.S. history saw 300,000 claims filed due to 3M military earplugs. Camp Lejeune's claims are expected to far exceed that number.Despite victims being scattered worldwide now, and attorneys as far away as at least Puerto Rico fighting for their business, the case is not multidistrict, meaning all of the lawsuits are being filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.District Judge James Dever told parties in March that he would handle the cases expeditiously. If he were to handle each lawsuit filed so far individually, it would take four judges 1,900 years, Public Radio East reported.\"We don't have a court system that could ever hear all those cases,\" Dunham saidFinding a lawyerMeanwhile, victims of Camp Lejeune's toxic waters still need to navigate finding a lawyer. Once the PACT Act passed Congress, commercials flooded the airwaves for lawyers who could help secure money for people who lived on the base and even off base.\"The honest to God truth is if they don't advertise, then no, the injured people aren't going to know what to do,\" Dunham said.But she understands that some of the commercials leave people uneasy.\"I'll tell you what my philosophy is, is that the justice system has to be available,\" Dunham said. \"You have to have access points for regular people, because it's always regular people who are injured.\"Dunham said if that means lawyers need to flood television to reach those who are injured, so be it. She added that someone is at greater risk of being taken advantage of if they walk into a random attorney's office who doesn't have experience but wants to go after a few claimants so they can take his share of the settlement.Flynn said it's important that people aren't victimized once again, this time by lawyers, through this process. Bell Law Group does not advertise on television.Flynn said to do your homework on law firms. Call around and ask to talk to attorneys to see if they're the right fit.\"The good ones will do that, and you should be able to speak to somebody that you just click with and feel like this person really knows what they're talking about,\" Flynn said.Commercials predicting a specific payout amount have frustrated Flynn. It's impossible for a lawyer to make that promise since none of these cases have been heard and there's no precedent.In the original draft of the bill to help Camp Lejeune water victims, lawmakers included a 25% cap on attorneys' fees so that lawyers couldn't take advantage of their clients. That cap was taken out before the PACT Act passed into law.Bloomberg reported in March that Bell Law Group spent more money than any other legal firm lobbying federal lawmakers over the past two years, and one of its requests was for the cap to be removed. Bell said he wouldn't object to a cap but believed lawyers should be able to charge up to 40%, Bloomberg reported.When asked about the cap, Flynn said the legislation was supported by an overwhelming and bipartisan majority of senators and representatives.\"We, too, support the law as enacted and are eager for these veterans and their families to finally get the justice they have long been entitled to,\" Flynn said.Ensminger told McClatchy he had felt that years ago Bell, who he had previously recommended to people like Palumbo, took advantage of Ensminger's connections to drive up business. Ensminger has since cut ties with the firm, and is now working with Mikal Watts out of Texas.Despite that and the attorneys' fees, Palumbo said he is grateful to the Bell group for helping him navigate through the legal system.Cancer after drinking, cooking and bathing in poisonous waterJeff Freuler, 57, a Townsville resident, also said he was thankful to the law firm as he navigates the long legal process ahead of him.Like the Palumbos, Freuler had no idea he drank, cooked with and bathed in poisonous water while stationed on the Marine base in the 1980s.Almost immediately after leaving the military, he began noticing neurological problems doctors couldn't explain: anxiety, depression, irritability, poor concentration, and changes in his mood and personality.Freuler did receive a letter in the early 2000s from the U.S. government warning him that he had been exposed to toxins at Camp Lejeune. But details in the letter were sparse and Freuler dismissed it.\"It was a very generic letter that held very little information,\" Freuler said.Then, things got serious.\"In 2012, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer,\" Freuler said. \"At a very young age, according to my urologist.\"Freuler underwent a robotic prostatectomy the week of Thanksgiving. The surgery was a success and the tissues taken from around his prostate came back negative for any spread.Initially, Freuler had to return to his doctor every few weeks to ensure the cancer didn't return. He now goes once every year.\"I was still in the dark,\" Freuler told McClatchy. \"I mean, there was really no information out there that could tie everything together\u2014the cancer that I had to the chemicals\u2014until just a few years ago.\"But as Ensminger continued to work, word reached Frueler, who said that as more information surfaced, the more he could connect both his neurological ailments and his cancer to the toxin exposures.\"Continuing to do the research and reading stuff, I mean, it just all started making a little bit more sense,\" Freuler said.What happens next?It's an emotional process for the Marines to come to terms with what happened and that the government was not upfront about it when officials first learned about the toxins.\"I signed up to serve my country, and I'll never regret it,\" Freuler said. \"What I do get emotional over is the fact that so much was done to cover this up, and it was some very hard work by a handful of people that wouldn't give up that brought all this to the surface.\"When we asked to join the military, when we were assigned to Camp Lejeune, we didn't have to get treated like this, to get poisoned like this by that water,\" Freuler said.For Frueler, there's always the question of what's next.\"It's always in the back of my mind, as long as you're walking around with a ticking time bomb and that's cancer, yeah it's not a matter of if it's going to go off, but when it's going to go off, and that plays with your mind,\" Freuler said.He said he had to compartmentalize that and push it to the back of his mind every day just to function.Then there's Palumbo. The illnesses didn't end with his wife. His oldest daughter, Kimberly, born on Camp Lejeune, died last June just months before the PACT Act passed, at age 59. Like her mother, she suffered from a series of painful health conditions before her death.\"I look back and I've said to myself many times if I just didn't live in the village rather than going to Tarawa Terrance, maybe my life would be different now,\" Palumbo said. \"I don't know. I'm just following what God's put in my path and trying to do the best I can with my children that I have now.\"Freuler said he filed his lawsuit to lend a voice to those of people like Palumbo, but also to look out for both himself and his daughter, because if another health issue arises because of the water, he doesn't know what they would do\u2014and they were only given until 2024 to figure it out.    2023 McClatchy Washington Bureau.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "text": "More than 50% of the largest lakes in the world are losing water, according to a new assessment published today in Science . The key culprits are not surprising: warming climate and unsustainable human consumption.          But lead author Fangfang Yao, a CIRES visiting fellow, now a climate fellow at University of Virginia, said the news is not entirely bleak. With this new method of tracking lake water storage trends and the reasons behind them, scientists can give water managers and communities insight into how to better protect critical sources of water and important regional ecosystems.\"This is the first comprehensive assessment of trends and drivers of global lake water storage variability based on an array of satellites and models,\" Yao said.He was motivated to do the research by the environmental crises in some of Earth's largest water bodies, such as the drying of the Aral Sea between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.So he and colleagues from the University of Colorado Boulder, Kansas State University, France, and Saudi Arabia created a technique to measure changes in water levels in nearly 2,000 of the world's biggest lakes and reservoirs, which represent 95% of the total lake water storage on Earth.The team combined three decades of observations from an array of satellites with models to quantify and attribute trends in lake storage globally.Globally, freshwater lakes and reservoirs store 87% of the planet's water, making them a valuable resource for both human and Earth ecosystems. Unlike rivers, lakes are not well monitored, yet they provide water for a large part of humanity\u2014even more than rivers.But despite their value, long-term trends and changes to water levels have been largely unknown\u2014until now.\"We have pretty good information on iconic lakes like Caspian Sea, Aral Sea and Salton Sea, but if you want to say something on a global scale, you need reliable estimates of lake levels and volume,\" said Balaji Rajagopalan, a CIRES fellow, professor of engineering at CU Boulder, and co-author. \"With this novel method \u2026we are able to provide insights into global lake level changes with a broader perspective.\"For the new paper, the team used 250,000 lake-area snapshots captured by satellites between 1992\u20132020 to survey the area of 1,972 of Earth's biggest lakes. They collected water levels from nine satellite altimeters and used long-term water levels to reduce any uncertainty. For lakes without a long-term level record, they used recent water measurements made by newer instruments on satellites. Combining recent level measurements with longer-term area measurements allowed scientists to reconstruct the volume of lakes dating back decades.      The results were staggering: 53% of lakes globally experienced a decline in water storage. The authors compare this loss with the magnitude of 17 Lake Meads, the largest reservoir in the United States.To explain the trends in natural lakes, the team leveraged recent advancements in water use and climate modeling. Climate change and human water consumption dominated the global net decline in natural lake volume and water losses in about 100 large lakes, Yao said. \"And many of the human and climate change footprints on lake water losses were previously unknown, such as the desiccations of Lake Good-e-Zareh in Afghanistan and Lake Mar Chiquita in Argentina.\"Lakes in both dry and wet areas of the world are losing volume. The losses in humid tropical lakes and Arctic lakes indicate more widespread drying trends than previously understood.Yao and his colleagues also assessed storage trends in reservoirs. They found that nearly two-thirds of Earth's large reservoirs experienced significant water losses.\"Sedimentation dominated the global storage decline in existing reservoirs,\" said Ben Livneh, also a co-author, CIRES fellow, and associate professor of engineering at CU Boulder. In long-established reservoirs\u2014those that filled before 1992\u2014sedimentation was more important than droughts and heavy rainfall years.While the majority of global lakes are shrinking, 24% saw significant increases in water storage. Growing lakes tend to be in underpopulated areas in the inner Tibetan Plateau and Northern Great Plains of North America and in areas with new reservoirs such as the Yangtze, Mekong, and Nile river basins.The authors estimate roughly one-quarter of the world's population, 2 billion people, resides in the basin of a drying lake, indicating an urgent need to incorporate human consumption, climate change, and sedimentation impacts into sustainable water resources management.And their research offers insight into possible solutions, Livneh said. \"If human consumption is a large factor in lake water storage decline, then we can adapt and explore new policies to reduce large-scale declines.\"This happened in one of the lakes the team studied, Lake Sevan in Armenia. Lake Sevan has seen an increase in water storage, in the last 20 years, which the authors linked to enforcement of conservation laws on water withdrawal since the early 2000s.

  "text": "In the years it strikes, the band of warm ocean water spanning from South America to Asia known as El Ni\u00f1o triggers far-reaching changes in weather that result in devastating floods, crop-killing droughts, plummeting fish populations, and an uptick in tropical diseases.          With El Ni\u00f1o projected to return this year, Dartmouth researchers report in the journal Science that the financial toll of the recurring climate pattern can persist for several years after the event itself\u2014and cost trillions in lost income worldwide. The study is among the first to evaluate the long-term costs of El Ni\u00f1o and projects losses that far exceed those estimated by previous research.El Ni\u00f1o is the warm phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, the natural cycle of warm and cold temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean that includes the cooler counterpart, La Ni\u00f1a. El Ni\u00f1o events alter weather patterns worldwide and, in the United States, typically result in wetter, warmer winters for the West Coast and a milder hurricane season on the Atlantic seaboard.The researchers spent two years examining global economic activity in the decades following the 1982\u201383 and 1997\u201398 El Ni\u00f1o events and found a \"persistent signature\" of slowed economic growth more than five years later. The global economy bled $4.1 trillion and $5.7 trillion, respectively, in the half-decade after each of these events, most of it borne by the world's poorest nations in the tropics.The researchers project that global economic losses for the 21st century will amount to $84 trillion as climate change potentially amplifies the frequency and strength of El Ni\u00f1o\u2014even if current pledges by world leaders to reduce carbon emissions come to fruition. The researchers estimate that the El Ni\u00f1o predicted for 2023 alone could hold the global economy back by as much as $3 trillion by 2029.Lead author Christopher Callahan, a doctoral candidate in geography at Dartmouth, said the study addresses an ongoing debate about how quickly societies rebound from major climate events such as El Ni\u00f1o.      \"We can say with certainty that societies and economies absolutely do not just take a hit and recover,\" said Callahan, adding that their data suggested a downturn after El Ni\u00f1o could last as long as 14 years, if not longer.\"In the tropics and places that experience the effects of El Ni\u00f1o, you get a persistent signature during which growth is delayed for at least five years,\" he said. \"The aggregate price tag on these events has not ever been fully quantified\u2014you have to add up all the depressed growth moving forward, not just when the event is happening.\"Senior author Justin Mankin, an assistant professor of geography, said the findings highlight a critical and understudied factor shaping the economic toll of global warming\u2014year-to-year variations in climate conditions. While these swings are largely independent from global warming, they can amplify or diminish its effects. Once described as the \"trunk of the tree of climate variability,\" El Ni\u00f1o is the largest and most important source of year-to-year climate variation, altering weather around the world and resonating across national economies.When it comes to climate change, world leaders and the public rightfully focus on the unabated rise in the global average temperature, Mankin said. \"But if you're estimating the costs of global warming without considering El Ni\u00f1o, then you are dramatically underestimating the costs of global warming.\"\"Our welfare is affected by our global economy, and our global economy is tied to the climate,\" Mankin said. \"When you ask how costly climate change is, you can start by asking how costly climate variation is. We're showing here that such variation, as embodied in El Ni\u00f1o, is incredibly costly and stagnates growth for years, which led us to cost estimates that are orders of magnitudes larger than previous ones.\"Callahan and Mankin found that the 1982\u201383 and 1997\u201398 events caused the gross domestic product of the United States to be approximately 3% lower in 1988 and 2003 than it would have been otherwise. But the GDPs of coastal tropical nations such as Peru and Indonesia were lower by more than 10% the same year.\"The global pattern of El Ni\u00f1o's effect on the climate and the prosperity of different countries reflects the unequal distribution of wealth and climate risk\u2014not to mention the responsibility for climate change\u2014worldwide,\" Mankin said. \"El Ni\u00f1o amplifies the wider inequities in climate change, disproportionately impacting the least resilient and prepared among us.\"\"The duration and magnitude of the financial repercussions we uncovered suggests to me that we are maladapted to the climate we have,\" he said. \"Our accounting dramatically raises the cost estimate of doing nothing. We need to both mitigate climate change and invest more in El Ni\u00f1o prediction and adaptation because these events will only amplify the future costs of global warming.\"The 2023 El Ni\u00f1o is predicted to come at a time when sea-surface temperatures are at an all-time high, Callahan said. The last major El Ni\u00f1o occurred in 2016 and made that year the hottest in recorded history. Global warming has only intensified in the seven years since. In addition, the world is coming out of an extended La Ni\u00f1a and the two phases can strengthen each other. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration projects the chances of El Ni\u00f1o setting in by late summer as higher than 80%.\"The deck is potentially stacked for a really big El Ni\u00f1o,\" Callahan said. \"Our results suggest that there will likely be a major economic toll that depresses economic growth in tropical countries for potentially up to a decade. The result could be trillions of dollars in productivity lost globally relative to a world without this El Ni\u00f1o.\" More information:Christopher W.

  "answer_squad": " calving",
  "text": "The Greenland ice sheet (GIS) and Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) contribute largely to global mean sea level (GMSL) changes, though the seas surrounding the Antarctic like the Bellinghausen-Amundsen Seas and the Indian Ocean sector are seeing significantly more warming than the rest of the marginal seas, with immediate noticeable effects on the mass balance (net weight of the glacier mainly accounting for ice gained by snow and lost by melting and calving) of the AIS.          The level AIS will contribute to the overall increase in sea level is unknown, and current models vary drastically, leaving a major question regarding future sea levels unanswered. The development of accurate modeling and technology that can help predict the future state of the Earth's oceans and ice sheets will be helpful in answering these questions.Researchers' findings were published in Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Research.\"In this paper, we identify key multiscale oceanic processes that are responsible for heat delivery to the bases of the Antarctic ice shelves and review our current understanding of these processes,\" said Zhaomin Wang, professor and first author of the study.One of these processes responsible for heat delivery is circumpolar deep water (CDW).CDW is a mix of the ocean's water masses from different ocean basins, culminating in a warm, salty mass of water in the Southern Ocean. This water can cut through the base of ice shelves rapidly, leading to \"cavities\", or cleaves in a glacier due to warm water currents. These cavities are then filled with warm-modified CDW and high salinity shelf water which eventually leads to loss of chunks from the tip of the glacier, known as \"calving\".CDW and cavity development are substantial processes, along with basal melting and calving, in which the AIS loses its mass and consequently is a significant contributor to the rise in GMSL.The effects CDW has on melting of Antarctic ice shelves, along with other mechanisms contributing to warm air and water circulation, are generally understood though they are poorly modeled with consistency. This may be due to not understanding small-scale processes, particularly when it comes to the effects eddies (short-lived oceanic circulation patterns) and the topography of cavities in the glacier have on melting.\"Both eddies and the dynamic effects of bottom topography have been proposed to be crucial in heat transport toward the fronts of ice shelves, in addition to heat transport by coastal currents,\" Wang said.These topographical subtleties help with understanding the transport of CDW and how coastal currents, surface winds, and bottom pressure torque all play into the interactions of these warm water currents with glacial masses and ice sheets.In review, ice melting thanks to warm water isn't as simple as it seems on the surface. Researchers surmised that while progress in learning the mechanisms in which oceanic warming is affecting the AIS is occurring, there needs to be improvement and innovation to assess where the continued melting of ice shelves in the Antarctic will leave humanity in the future. Retreating coastlines and GMSL rise are anticipated, though the levels to be expected are poorly understood.Researchers suggest priorities are made, starting with improving cavity geometry, bathymetry (measuring the depth of water) and future projections of the mass balance of ice sheets. Spending time investigating small-scale processes may also provide valuable information leading to better future models being developed, and critically, determining what the mass loss of the AIS means for atmospheric, oceanic, and sea ice circulations.

  "text": "Mountains are capped with record snowpack, rolling hills are covered in a rainbow of wildflowers, reservoirs are filled to the brim, and rivers are rushing with snowmelt.          A vast majority of California is finally out of drought this month, after a punishing multiyear period of severe aridity that forced statewide water cuts and fueled existential fear over the future of the water supply.Although a series of massive storms during the winter months brought desperately needed precipitation throughout the Golden State, water experts and state officials remain focused on preparing for the inevitable next drought. Based on lessons learned in recent years, they're refilling the state's over-drafted groundwater aquifers and encouraging water efficiency among residents learning to live with climate change.By recharging groundwater basins and keeping in place some conservation policies, state and local water officials can help alleviate the pain of future droughts\u2014but those efforts require flexibility and more investment, said Andrew Ayres, a research fellow with the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan think tank.\"There's still a lot of work to do to make sure that we can provide reliability in the next drought,\" he said. \"Whenever that rolls around, things are always uncertain. It could be next year, and we might be right back into it.\"After the deluge in a rare wet winter, less than 6% of California is in moderate drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, a federal service run in partnership with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Yet nearly a third of the state is still abnormally dry.With many of the state's reservoirs nearing full capacity\u2014and others likely to continue to fill up as the mountains' snow melts and flows downstream\u2014state and federal water authorities are for the first time in nearly two decades allocating full amounts of requested water supplies for cities and farming communities.The storms this winter have helped restore reservoirs, but the state should continue building long-term water resilience, said Jeanine Jones, the interstate resources manager for the California Department of Water Resources, the agency in charge of water allotments.      \"While this precipitation has helped surface water supplies and eased impacts from the state's record-breaking drought, California's groundwater basins are still depleted due to prolonged dry conditions and will require more than a single wet year to recover,\" she wrote in an emailed statement.State and local water officials have for months focused on recharging groundwater basins through new investment and efforts such as diverting and collecting storm water. Additionally, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in a March executive order eased some regulations so communities could more easily capture and store floodwater in the ground\u2014sometimes by flooding fields and letting that water seep.Some of that groundwater recharging will occur around wetlands and floodplains, which could be a boon for migratory birds and other wildlife whose habitats have suffered in recent years.But the increase in water also can bring its own challenges. With so much snowmelt, flooding is already taking a toll in some areas of the state. The once dormant Tulare Lake in the San Joaquin Valley has flooded the surrounding Central California community and farmland.Much of Southern California's water supply from the Colorado River also remains in flux.Last month, the Biden administration released three proposals for the future of water-sharing among the seven states that use water from the Colorado River, whose basin is still in a 23-year drought. Most of Southern California's cities and farmland get their water from the river.In order to prevent going to court, Western states will have to agree on one of those proposals, which primarily weigh California's historic water rights against what other states argue is an updated, more equitable approach.Through the recent Inflation Reduction Act and other laws, the feds also are providing millions of dollars to incentivize farmers and ranchers in the Colorado River's upper basin states to forgo some water use and allow greater flows downstream. Money is going toward Salton Sea restoration in Southern California, as well.There's a common refrain among conservationists: Plan for the wet times when it's dry, and plan for the dry times when it's wet.A conservation mentality among California residents hasn't fully sunk in yet, said Heather Cooley, the director of research at the Pacific Institute, an Oakland-based nonprofit that studies water policy.Communities must continue building resiliency to a hotter and drier climate, she said, by replacing old, wasteful appliances and fixtures with more modern, efficient models; replacing water-intensive grass with plants that are more suited for the Western climate; and building new infrastructure to capture and recycle stormwater.\"What we're seeing in this shift from an extreme drought to now extreme flooding is emblematic of climate change,\" she said. \"It's a future of more extremes. Now is the time to be making our communities resilient.\"    2023 States Newsroom.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "text": "French lawmakers have voted to ban smoking in all forests and woods during the fire season, part of a series of proposed measures to tackle growing destruction and dangers from climate change-related blazes.          National Assembly lawmakers voted 197-0 in a first reading on Wednesday night of a proposed law to better prevent and tackle forest fires. The draft has already passed through the Senate.An amendment also adopted by lawmakers would ban smoking in or near all forests and woods when authorities deem the fire-risk to be elevated. The fire season that was commonly in summer is now extending to other months in drought-hit areas of southern France and other parts of Europe where climate warming poses the greatest risks.France's firefighters have already battled woodland-destroying blazes that started unusually early this year. Droughts that hit France last year have been compounded by shortages of rain this past winter, leaving tinder-dry woodlands at even greater risk.The smoking ban will build on an existing forest law that already bans the lighting of fires within 200 meters of wooded areas. It aims to reduce the risk of fires started by discarded cigarettes\u2014a frequent cause of blazes, especially when woodlands are tinder-dry. The government says human activity is by far the most frequent trigger of forest fires in France, responsible for 90% of blazes.Lawmaker Anthony Brosse, who proposed the smoking amendment, said it would make the legislation clearer for French citizens.Senators and National Assembly lawmakers will work next on a final draft of the proposed law before its expected adoption.Forest fires have long regularly afflicted France, one of the most wooded countries in Europe. But they generally used to start later in the year. Major wildfires in Europe are now starting earlier, becoming more frequent and harder to stop, and doing more damage.

  "answer_squad": " Keney Park",
  "text": "Urban green spaces provide innumerable benefits for surrounding communities. They are places to enjoy nature, exercise, and gather. Green spaces are also vital for combating urban heat island impacts, they help clean the air, and can be important for slowing stormwater.          However, not everyone has equal access to green spaces, and knowing who does is important for making these places accessible and equitable. Though many studies have tried to understand these questions, the results are unclear. College of Agriculture, Health and Natural Resources doctoral researcher Pan Zhang and Assistant Professor Sohyun Park, both in the Department of Plant Science and Landscape Architecture, wanted to take a deeper look at factors contributing to inequity in park access and park quality and fill in the gaps from previous studies. Their research was published in Applied Geography.Zhang's interest in the topic started before her Ph.D. studies when she worked at a nonprofit organization in a neighborhood adjacent to Keney Park, the largest of Hartford's parks. Zhang noticed fewer people visiting the part than she expected, and wanted to understand why:\"Because I spent a lot of time in the area, I realized even though the residents are very close to the largest park in the city, it was very quiet. When I started my Ph.D., under the encouragement of Dr. Park, I wanted to learn more.\"Zhang approached the question of park inequity and access by studying its relationship to socio-economic variables.\"Normally, these kinds of studies look at whether people have access or not, but also, I was looking at the acreage, or particularly park congestion\u2014how many people were sharing one acre of the park. The third factor was crime, which could explain the phenomena. I was able to explore the patterns within the city, not just talk about the fact that there is unequal access, but I was able to identify areas that should be improved.\"Zhang looked at spatial data including roads and parks within the city limits to assess accessibility within a 10-minute walk for residents. Zhang also looked at three years of police incident data, and the American Community Survey to assess demographic and socioeconomic data. To assess park access and spatial patterns Zhang used spatial analysis in ArcGIS and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR).      The results of this multidimensional analysis show that understanding park disparity requires a more rigorous approach to have a more accurate and unbiased assessment of park access since the patterns observed were very location specific and the factors had low correlations to one another.\"The three access factors\u2014proximity, congestion, and crime\u2014have very different patterns and distributions,\" Zhang says.For example, areas with higher crime rates have a different equity pattern compared to other areas of the city. Specifically, Zhang explains the southern neighborhood has more severe park inequity despite being close to parks and having high park congestion rates.\"I found that in the city, socio-economic factors were negatively related to the crime rates in some of the northern parts of the city, but it was positively related to a higher crime rate in the southern part of the city. We also saw that housing vacancy rates were associated with higher crime rates in the southern part of the neighborhood. Dr. Park and I work on these issues in Hartford, and usually, it is due to negative aspects like blight and crime, but we always say these spaces could also be an opportunity if they have better maintenance and if we can increase the green space by using those lots, maybe we can change the issue of the neighborhood needing more green space.\"Zhang explains that when she saw the distinct patterns, she could explain some aspects by considering the post-industrial history of Hartford and surrounding cities in the Northeast. The parks were designed in the last century or earlier, for the white working or upper-class populations living within the city. Gradually, factors like redlining and white flight led to demographic and socioeconomic changes in the city, Zhang says,\"Now other populations inherited those spaces, but because of the post-industrialization, these spaces become less well-preserved and that draws attention to the quality of the space instead of whether it's there or not.\"With urban shrinkage, the researchers cite a silver lining with empty lots in that they provide opportunities to build new green spaces.\"The strength of the study is the specific patterns of the park inequity in different locations, even within the same city,\" says Park. \"If you are thinking about taking measures, it should be really geography specific.\"Future directions for the research include further exploring the shrinking city theory, says Zhang, who is interested in seeing if other shrinking cities share similar patterns to those seen in Hartford. Zhang is also interested in examining legacy cities and fast-growing cities like Denver, Colorado, to compare patterns.\"I know there are a lot of environmental justice studies, but most of them focus on a growing city because with new investments there are injustice issues in terms of where these resources go,\" says Zhang. \"Another future direction is to analyze the funding distribution supporting park establishment and maintenance to see equity. An interesting detail is even though Hartford Parks have these issues, a lot of funding from the municipality goes to support parks outside the city boundaries in West Hartford and Wethersfield.\"Data from the study suggests that resource availability is a factor for the lower-income neighborhoods that experienced the highest crime. These methods could be beneficial in addressing social justice issues and funding disparities to help municipalities determine where to allocate funding for the greatest, most socially just, impacts.\"Though this study focuses on the Hartford context, I think the methodology employed can be replicated in other regions as well. The findings can then point where we can try to use discretion about where to spend resources to provide more park spaces, where would need better maintenance, or where you should develop enhanced safety measures,\" says Park.

  "text": "Florida State University researchers have analyzed the carbon exported from surface waters of the California Current Ecosystem\u2014the first-ever study to quantify the total carbon sequestration for a region of the ocean.          The study, published in Nature Communications, serves as a framework for assessing how the processes that sequester carbon might change in a warmer world, while also creating a blueprint for similar budgets in other ocean regions.Understanding the carbon cycle\u2014the sources and reservoirs of carbon\u2014is an important focus of Earth sciences. Many studies have examined the carbon sequestered by sinking particles formed from algal production. Fewer studies have focused on plankton particles that move to the deep ocean through other methods or the marine life that migrates vertically through layers of the ocean.\"Our study is the first to put all of these different processes together to fully investigate the processes driving the biological carbon pump for a major ocean region,\" said lead author Michael Stukel, an associate professor in FSU's Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science.Stukel and his team found that a host of processes contribute to the movement of organic carbon through the marine ecosystem. Their analysis confirmed that sinking particles are the dominant process transporting carbon, but they also found that particles transported by ocean currents and zooplankton that migrate down into the deep ocean every day contribute 30 to 40 percent of carbon sequestered in the deep ocean.The data comes from 15 years of research cruises by the California Current Ecosystem Long-Term Ecological Research program in an area that spans from San Diego to Monterey Bay and extends about 300 miles offshore. Stukel and his team combined information collected during those trips with computer modeling.The algae in the surface ocean perform about half the world's photosynthesis, but they live for a week, so the carbon dioxide they take in only gets sequestered if the carbon created by plankton somehow moves into the deep ocean, a process known as the biological carbon pump.That process transports five to twelve petagrams of carbon into the deep ocean every year. For perspective, humans emit about ten petagrams of carbon annually.As climate change alters the Earth, it's unclear how it might affect processes like the biological carbon pump.\"We don't know if the biological carbon pump will take up more or less carbon dioxide in the future,\" Stukel said. \"The first step in answering that question is putting together a full budget for what's happening now.

  "text": "Publishing in the journal Nature Sustainability, a team of conservationists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society say that providing a \"Conservation Basic Income\" (CBI)\u2014of $5.50 per day to all residents of protected areas in low- and middle-income countries would cost less than annual subsidies given to fossil fuels and other environmentally harmful industries.          CBI is an unconditional cash payment to individuals, similar to universal basic income (UBI) but targeting residents of important conservation areas. A Conversation Basic Income would support stewardship of land and biodiversity by Indigenous Peoples and local communities.The authors provided the first global estimates for the gross costs of CBI using spatial analyses of three plausible future conservation scenarios. Gross costs vary widely, depending on the areas and populations included as well as the payment amounts: from $351 billion to $6.73 trillion annually.The authors say a CBI is a potentially powerful mechanism for facilitating a radical shift in conservation. They say that evidence from other poverty-alleviation cash transfer programs that are unconditional with respect to conservation outcomes suggest that a CBI could achieve conservation in many contexts. For example, Indonesia's national program of anti-poverty cash transfers also reduced deforestation across Indonesia.Said lead author Dr. Emiel de Lange of WCS's Cambodia Program, \"CBI more equitably distributes the costs and benefits of conservation because basic income schemes improve well-being, reduce poverty, and redress inequalities including gender inequity. Inequalities, including gender, are key drivers of biodiversity loss. CBI could enable communities to pursue their own visions of a good life and avoid exploitation by extractive industries.\"\"Moreover, through redistribution of wealth from affluent populations and/or harmful industries, CBI can reduce aggregate global consumption and environmental impact.\"These costs of a CBI are significant compared to current government conservation spending, (~$133 billion in 2020) but represent a potentially sensible investment in safeguarding incalculable social and natural values as well as the estimated $44 trillion in global economic production dependent on nature.

  "text": "Human-caused greenhouse gas emissions mean strong El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events are occurring more often, according to our new research published in Nature Reviews Earth & Environment, which provides important new evidence of the human fingerprint on Earth's climate.          For more than 30 years, climate researchers have puzzled over the link between human-caused climate change and El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events. We set out to bridge this knowledge gap.Climate scientists have long observed a correlation between climate change impacts on our oceans and atmosphere, and the increase in greenhouse gas emissions from human activity.Our research examined when this activity may have started to make El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events more extreme. Our deep analysis found a relationship between human-caused greenhouse gas activity and changes to El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a.Our findings were five years in the making. They help us understand how El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a will change as the world warms in the future.What are El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a?La Ni\u00f1a typically brings wet, cooler conditions to much of Australia. Every few years it alternates with an El Ni\u00f1o, which typically brings drier, hotter conditions. Together, the two phases are known as the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation.The events are driven by changes in sea-surface temperature in the tropical Pacific Ocean. During an El Ni\u00f1o, the surface temperature is warmer than usual. During a La Ni\u00f1a, it's colder than usual.Small changes in sea-surface temperature can lead to big changes in the atmosphere. That's how El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events can so dramatically affect weather patterns around the world.The El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation is naturally occurring. But over the last 50 years or so, strong El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events have occurred more often. Was climate change playing a role? Our research set out to answer this question.      Unpicking climate 'variability'So how might climate change affect the development of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a?Decades of observations of climate change show sea surface temperatures are warming. In many oceans across the world, including the Pacific, this has caused the sea surface to warm faster than the water below.We set out to understand what impact this warming had on the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation in the past century.Our research analyzed several simulations produced by 43 \"climate models,\" or computer simulations of Earth's climate system.First, we compared simulations from between 1901\u20131960 with those from 1961\u20132020. Most results showed an increase in the \"variability\" of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation since 1960.Variability refers to a departure from the average. In this case, our results show strong El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events have occurred more frequently than average since 1960. This finding is consistent with observations over the same periods.We then examined climate simulations over hundreds of years before humans started ramping up greenhouse gas emissions, and compared these to the simulations after 1960.This analysis showed even more clearly the very strong variability in the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation after 1960. This reinforces the finding that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions are the culprit.The strong variability has contributed to more extreme and frequent droughts, floods, heatwaves, bushfires and storms around the world.So what's next?Previous research suggests the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation will continue to change this century. In particular, we can expect more intense and frequent El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events.We can also expect more frequent swings from a strong El Ni\u00f1o to a strong La Ni\u00f1a the following year.These predictions apply to various emission scenarios. Even if greenhouse gas emissions were slashed and global warming was kept to 1.5\u2103, as per the goal of the Paris Agreement, we can expect more frequent strong El Nino events for another century. That's because the Pacific Ocean holds a lot of heat, which will take several decades to dissipate.Of course, variability in the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation is already making itself felt. Think back to the extreme El Ni\u00f1o of 2015, which led to drought across much of Australia. And of course, a rare \"triple\" La-Nina from 2020 to 2022 led to severe flooding in eastern Australia.An El Ni\u00f1o may develop later this year. As climate change worsens, we must prepare for many more of these potentially damaging climate events.

  "text": "Devastating floods have hit community after community on Australia's eastern seaboard over the last three years. Weather systems were dynamic and difficult to forecast.          What made the impact worse still was the fact that many of our flood gauges were unreliable or broken. In some cases, residents simply didn't know the extent of the floodwaters rushing toward them.As a resident of a flood-hit New South Wales town told us: \"During that second flood we knew that gauge was wrong. It was wrong by meters. On the night of the February flood, very few people could sleep [\u2026] I remember looking at [warnings] and I'm thinking \"What? How can that be?'\"New federal funding for a better flood warning network is wise. But flood gauges are only one part of a total warning system. Social factors also require consideration.Gathering better data to improve flood warnings Public money (A$236 million) will be used to upgrade or purchase flood gauges for high priority catchments, replacing infrastructure found to be unreliable or broken.We've known there were problems with our flood warning infrastructure for years.But these issues came to a head during the widespread flooding in the first half of 2022 when communities were misled, confused or wrong-footed by unreliable information. Subsequent inquiries in New South Wales and Queensland found major issues and recommended the federal government take responsibility for building and maintaining the flood warning network.We've long known that early warning systems boost public safety and reduce deaths. They cut financial losses and make possible earlier planning and responses by emergency services.But by themselves, they are not enough. Some people will leave when warned, but others due to a range of social and economic factors, are either unable to leave or choose to stay. That's why we need social supports alongside warning systems.In our recent research, we interviewed almost 200 NSW and Queensland residents affected by floods in early to mid 2022 and surveyed 430 others.People told us they relied heavily on river gauge data\u2014when it was available and working. But when the gauges were broken or giving incorrect data, residents were left worried and confused.Longtime residents in low-lying rural areas and in some upper catchment areas often had a good understanding of how rain and stormwater behaved in their landscape and how that translated to flooding. When they shared this knowledge on community social media pages, it was highly valued by many other residents, who used it to help interpret gauge data and river heights.      What matters is how people respond to warnings It's clearly important to give people warning about the size and timing of a flood which may affect them. Successful warnings are those which are accurate and timely, relevant to the specific area, motivate people to evacuate, if need be, and lead to reduced loss of life and property.But even when warnings are received in time, research shows they're unlikely to actually motivate safe, timely evacuation by most of the people at risk.Our own research found over 60% of surveyed residents did not evacuate.Why did people stay? It wasn't for lack of timely warnings, for the most part.For some, staying was the plan. Many had stayed in previous floods and had been safe. Others stayed to lift up their belongings, protect against looting and start the clean-up quickly after the waters receded. Some stayed to look after less mobile dependants, care for pets and livestock, or because they had nowhere else to go.After the 2017 NSW floods, researchers found a similar approach of sheltering in place in some locations.The problem is, previous floods are now no longer a reliable guide. Climate change is leading to more intense rain and more extreme floods. Choosing to stay because you were safe last time is no guarantee.We need better supports Given that many people choose to stay, we must do more to help people make the decision to evacuate and ensure those who are determined to shelter, or have no other choice, are better prepared to do so safely.Each of us has a social context which greatly shapes our ability to act on information. Life might be complex or chaotic due to precarious housing, limited finances, poor health, caring responsibilities, or a lack of community connections. These social factors may make any of us reluctant\u2014or simply unable\u2014to act on warnings and prepare or evacuate.For instance, one interviewee told us: \"I am reliant on support workers to access the community, and due to the rising waters in outer suburbs the supports I had were unable to physically get to me.\"Another said, \"I was pregnant at the time and couldn't do the heavy lifting required. I didn't have the vehicle space to load things to remove from the property.\"Warnings are not a guarantee of safety Yes, it's good the federal government is introducing a better way to monitor floods and warn people who live near affected creeks and rivers. But providing a warning is only part of the puzzle. We need many solutions that work together.Sometimes warnings don't get through. Sometimes disasters escalate rapidly. Sometimes people can't or won't take action. Warnings alone do not produce community resilience, but they can help.As we brace for a future where natural hazards intensify, we need more resilience.For floods, that means focusing on community connections, education, health and livelihoods, as well as land use planning and building design that reduces exposure to flood risk in the first place. We also need technical solutions like warning systems. Together, this will lead to a more resilient future.

  "text": "British Columbia and Alberta are on fire. Tens of thousands of people have had to evacuate in Alberta, while much of B.C. is already experiencing higher-than-usual wildfire risk. With more than 150 fires currently burning across the two provinces, a hazardous haze is blanketing Calgary and affecting air quality as far away as the East Coast.          The average area burned by wildfires and the cost of suppression have grown steadily over the past 12 years, indicating increasingly larger and more intense wildfires. The 2017 fire season set the record for most hectares burned in B.C. It was surpassed in 2018. Three years later, a wildfire destroyed the town of Lytton, B.C.. That season incurred the highest ever cost of fire suppression\u2014$718 million.Last year, B.C. adopted a year-round wildfire service in the hopes of mitigating wildfire risk through actions such as controlled burns, indicating a shift from a responsive mindset to a more proactive one. But as we look beyond the monumental task of reducing yearly fire losses, we come upon a much bigger question: How do we prepare for disasters whose timing is uncertain, like earthquakes, while also responding to immediate crises?High-risk, high-uncertainty events like earthquakes tend to fall out of view when we are occupied with more predictable seasonal events like wildfires, which have very visible effects on our lives and the landscape right now. Our research suggests a critical need for integrated disaster governance and policy planning that considers the full range of risks, regardless of whether they are affecting us now or in the future.The present biasResearch and life experience tells us that, as humans, we are good at focusing on immediate needs while pushing longer-term processes down the priority list until they gain urgency.We tend to follow the same patterns when facing disasters. We are good at focusing on things that are on fire now, while being unable or unwilling to take on the long-term tasks that will keep other disasters from occurring in the first place. Studies in behavioral economics call this tendency to place a higher value on the current time \"present bias.\"When applied to disaster planning, this means future preparedness and mitigation activities can face an uphill battle, even though spending slightly more in the present, for instance in constructing earthquake-safe buildings, may result in large future benefits.These effects of present bias are a dilemma for disaster planning, as the vast majority of societal attention and resources are dedicated to moments in crisis, rather than to preventing crises.      Dealing with uncertaintyOne way of dealing with uncertainty in disaster planning is shifting the ways that we think about the relationship disasters have with time. Adapting a phrase that anthropologist Stephanie Kane has applied to river courses, the potential for damaging earthquakes sits at \"the precarious intersections of our historical and geological times.\"Geological time exists on a scale far exceeding human lifespans, but we encounter it through the hazards that affect our lives and homes in the present.Major Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) earthquakes, for example, tend to occur along the West Coast in intervals of 200 to 600 years. Meanwhile, a combination of Indigenous oral histories, coastal ghost forests and Japanese records of an orphan tsunami, show the last CSZ earthquake occurred on Jan. 26, 1700. This is the moment that the CSZ's geological process last intersected with historical time.The next \"Really Big One\" or \"Cascadia event,\" could potentially cause thousands of deaths and displace upwards of a million people in B.C., Washington and Oregon. Yet it still feels unreal, as it might happen tomorrow or long after we are dead.A multi-hazard approachHazards like earthquakes, storms and wildfires are part of the natural world but they don't have to result in disasters.Disasters occur when we are not prepared for the hazards that we know can happen, and their inequitable harms fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable members of our society. Multiple hazards can compound to create a multilayered disaster, like when extreme heat in B.C. coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic in the summer of 2021.This is why we need to take on a \"multi-hazard approach\" to reducing disaster risk. A multi-hazard approach looks at the full range of possible hazards in relation to each other: fires, floods, extreme heat, pandemics and earthquakes.Sometimes these hazards are causally interconnected\u2014for instance debris flows or landslides that occur in the wake of wildfire. But even when their onset is distinct, many of the strategies needed for responding to one can also be useful for responding to others, if the relevant agencies, governments and residents communicate efficiently to develop shared protocols.The establishment of B.C.'s new Ministry of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness last year is a tacit acknowledgement that better co-ordination is needed to help mitigate the multiple hazards B.C. faces, especially as the climate crisis accelerates.Keeping disaster knowledge presentWhile present crises may overshadow the past and limit considerations of the future, they can also inspire people to plan for future scenarios, for instance through earthquake modeling.Keeping the knowledge of disaster present through cultural practice can act as a source of social cohesion. Our current understanding of the long-term earthquake risk in Cascadia is grounded as much in geotechnical analyses as it is in the intergenerational knowledge of the Indigenous peoples of the region.Long before the last CSZ earthquake in 1700, First Nations have transmitted knowledge about earthquakes and tsunamis, as well as responses to them, through visual art, oral history and dance. It is no surprise they are now at the forefront of forging strategies for coordinated disaster response.Knowledge transmission requires communication and a desire for understanding shared experiences by those in the aftermath of a disaster and those yet to face one. This kind of society-building takes place through intergenerational, intercultural sharing and community-making efforts by neighbors and policymakers who can see the value in the \"soft\" mitigation measures of relationship-building at the slow speed of trust.After more than a hundred years of banned cultural burning, wildfires are more intense than ever. Rather than suppressing all fires, B.C.'s firefighting services are now learning to work with Indigenous people to manage fire as a part of a healthy ecosystem. This requires thinking in terms of the whole life cycle of the forest, rather than a single fire season.A shift in how we think about time can help us avoid our present bias and be ready for the next big disaster.

  "text": "As society reckons with climate change, there's a growing call to keep fossil fuels right where they are, in the ground. But the impact of curtailing oil production will depend on the policies we implement to achieve this.          An interdisciplinary team of researchers investigated the carbon emissions, labor and health implications of several policies to reduce oil extraction, with a special focus on how the effects vary across different communities in California. Their results, published in Nature Energy, illustrate the tradeoffs between different strategies.For instance, models banning oil extraction near communities produced greater health benefits across the state, but they also led to more job losses, with disadvantaged communities feeling about one third of both the costs and the benefits.With a goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2045, California is currently implementing some of the world's most ambitious climate policies. As the country's seventh largest oil-producing state and the world's fifth largest economy, California provides a unique setting to study supply-side decarbonization policies. It already has a carbon cap-and-trade program and is currently debating a setback policy that would ban new oil production near communities.Many considerationsPetroleum production is a multifaceted endeavor. The greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels are the main driver of climate change. Extracting these resources also emits CO2 into the environment, in addition to air pollution and toxic substances. Any policies seeking to curb oil production will affect people for better and worse. The industry employed 25,000 Californians in 2019, and provides tax revenue to local governments.\"Our analysis is trying to quantify what those tradeoffs look like as the state considers different policies,\" said co-author Kyle Meng, an associate professor in UC Santa Barbara's economics department and the Environmental Markets Lab (emLab) at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management.\"We're taking traditionally climate-focused policies and comparing them along local impacts, health benefits and employment costs,\" added co-lead author Paige Weber, an environmental economist at UNC Chapel Hill, previously an emLab post-doc.The authors developed a framework to analyze the impact of three policies: an excise tax (paid per barrel); a carbon tax (paid per ton emitted); and setbacks at 1000 feet, 2500 feet and 1 mile. Taxes increase the cost of production, curbing activity and driving down emissions. Setbacks essentially ban extraction in areas where people live.In a previous study, the authors found that production decreases because it might not be economical to drill somewhere else.To compare between the policies, each setback distance had a corresponding excise and carbon tax level that achieved the same emissions target in 2045.The authors started with a suite of models to predict oil production in California. Using historical data and economic theory, the team attempted to answer the following questions: Will they drill here? How much will a well produce? When will it shut down?The researchers then modeled the health impacts of oil production emissions as they spread across California's communities. Finally, they modeled the outcome that each policy would have on jobs and worker compensation. The authors were especially curious how these effects fell on people living in areas that meet California's definition of a disadvantaged community.They calibrated the health and labor consequences of each policy based on its ability to reduce carbon. \"We ask, for the same greenhouse gas reduction, which policy has greater health benefits and fewer labor costs, and how are these benefits and costs distributed?\" Meng explained.      Always a tradeoffSetbacks offered the greatest air-quality improvements, especially to disadvantaged communities. If you move oil production away from where people live, they'll see health benefits. But there was a surprising tradeoff. When oil production is close to communities, so are the jobs it offers. \"The same communities that benefit from cleaner air are also those facing labor market consequences,\" Meng said.During policy discussions, there's often disagreement between groups highlighting the health impact of oil production and those focused on the employment benefits. \"They're often pitched as separate camps,\" Meng continued. \"But our analysis shows that costs and benefits can be borne by the same communities.\"Carbon and excise taxes both work by raising production costs, but the two policies target different oilfields. An excise tax eliminates the most expensive operations first, and falls roughly in the middle in terms of job and health implications.\"The cheapest way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would be with a carbon tax because it goes after the most carbon-intensive oil extractors first,\" Weber said. But since it takes the smallest number of wells out of production per ton of carbon emissions reduced, a carbon tax offers the lowest total health benefits, while also leading to the lowest job losses.The authors believe their estimates of the health impacts are conservative. They focused solely on premature mortality, as other health impacts are more difficult to quantify. As a result, any action will likely improve the health of Californians more than what the study lays out.Similarly, the researchers expect they overestimated the labor impacts because their framework doesn't account for the possibility of re-employment. It assumes that every job lost results in unemployment.The path forwardBy 2045, California aims to reduce emissions in the transportation sector by 90% compared with 2019. And the Golden State is looking to many policies to achieve this.\"It's a hotly debated issue right now because the governor just signed a law banning new oil drilling near communities,\" said co-lead author Ranjit Deshmukh, an assistant professor in UC Santa Barbara's Environmental Studies Program. The oil industry quickly circumvented this action by collecting enough signatures to place a referendum on the next ballot.\"Unfortunately, even the largest setback distance did not reach the state's greenhouse gas reduction target,\" Weber said. \"So, you'd need to combine a setback with another policy.\"The state currently has no plans to use an excise tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from oil extraction, the authors said. On the other hand, the state's cap-and-trade program functions much like a carbon tax. The only difference is that the market finds a price based on the cap, rather than it being set by the government. That said, the cap-and-trade program spans many sectors in the state, not just fossil fuel extraction.This paper captured employment and health impacts on a much finer resolution than previous studies. Looking at, say, county averages for health benefits can be misleading, the researchers explained. Consider Los Angeles county: There's a lot of variation between people living in Compton and Hollywood, or Long Beach and Lancaster. \"A much finer resolution analysis is needed to accurately answer the question of how different communities bear the costs or get the benefits of this oil phase-out,\" Deshmukh said.The empirical aspect of their framework was also an innovation. Most other studies used only engineering models to forecast production. Using detailed historical extraction data gave the authors more confidence in the accuracy of their projections.The team has begun similar work investigating the health and labor impacts of phasing out oil refining in California. And they plan to extend their analysis on petroleum production to the rest of the country. They hope their work will guide policymakers towards an effective, equitable solution for curbing fossil fuel extraction. One that maximizes its benefits while reducing its drawbacks.

  "text": "Scientists have discovered the cause of giant underwater landslides in Antarctica, which they believe could have generated tsunami waves that stretched across the Southern Ocean.          An international team of researchers has uncovered layers of weak, fossilized and biologically-rich sediments hundreds of meters beneath the sea floor.These formed beneath extensive areas of underwater landslides, many of which cut more than 100 meters into the seabed.Writing in Nature Communications, the scientists say these weak layers\u2014made up of historic biological material\u2014made the area susceptible to failure in the face of earthquakes and other seismic activity.They also highlight that the layers formed at a time when temperatures in Antarctica were up to 3\u00b0C warmer than they are today, when sea levels were higher and ice sheets much smaller than at present.With the planet currently going through a period of extensive climate change\u2014once again including warmer waters, rising sea levels and shrinking ice sheets\u2014researchers believe there is the potential for such incidents to be replicated.Through analyzing the effects of past underwater landslides, they say future seismic events off the coast of Antarctica might again pose a risk of tsunami waves reaching the shores of South America, New Zealand and South East Asia.

Thanks to exceptional preservation of the sediments beneath the sea floor, we have for the first time been able to show what caused these historical landslides in this region of Antarctica and also indicate the impact of such events in the future. Our findings highlight how we urgently need to enhance our understanding of how global climate change might influence the stability of these regions and potential for future tsunamis.\"Drilling into the seabed of the Ross Sea during International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 374 to recover one of the hundreds of cores which helped scientists assess the cause of historic landslides. Credit: Laura de SantisProfessor Rob McKay, Director of the Antarctic Research Centre at Victoria University of Wellington and co-chief scientist of IODP Expedition 374, added, \"The main aim of our IODP drilling project in 2018 was to understand the influence that warming climate and oceans have had on melting Antarctica's ice sheets in the past in order to understand its future response. However, when Dr. Gales and her colleagues on board the OGS Explora mapped these huge scarps and landslides the year before, it was quite a revelation to us to see how the past changes in climates we were studying from drilling were directly linked to submarine landslide events of this magnitude. We did not expect to see this, and it is a potential hazard that certainly warrants further investigation.\"Laura De Santis, a researcher at the National Institute of Oceanography and Applied Geophysics in Italy, and also co-chief scientist of IODP Expedition 374, explained, \"The sediment cores we analyzed were obtained as part of IODP, the international sea floor scientific drilling project that has been active in the field of geoscience for over 50 years. The project aims to explore the history of planet Earth, including ocean currents, climate change, marine life and mineral deposits, by studying sediments and rocks beneath the sea floor.\"Jan Sverre Laberg, from The Arctic University of Norway, Troms\u00f8, said, \"Giant submarine landslides have occurred both on southern and northern high latitude continental margins, including the Antarctic and Norwegian continental margins. More knowledge on these events in Antarctica will also be relevant for submarine geohazard evaluation offshore Norway.\"Dr. Amelia Shevenell, Associate Professor of Geological Oceanography at University of South Florida, College of Marine Science, noted, \"This study illustrates the importance of scientific ocean drilling and marine geology for understanding both past climate change and identifying regions susceptible to natural hazards to inform infrastructure decisions. Large landslides along the Antarctic margin have the potential to trigger tsunamis, which may result in substantial loss of life far from their origin. Further, national Antarctic programs are investigating the possibility of installing submarine cables to improve communications from Antarctic research bases. Our study, from the slope of the Ross Sea, is located seaward of major national and international research stations, indicating that marine geological and geophysical feasibility studies are essential to the success of these projects and should be completed early in the development process, before countries invest in and depend on this communication infrastructure.\" More information:Climate-controlled submarine landslides on the Antarctic continental margin, Nature Communications (2023).

  "text": "From satellites that can pinpoint the sources of industrial pollution, to others that track hurricane movements by the hour, space has emerged as a key front in the fight against climate change.          New launches are\u2014literally and metaphorically\u2014skyrocketing, and giving rise to increased cooperation between space agencies and private companies.Among the most fruitful areas of collaboration: tracking greenhouse gas emissions.The potent planet heating gas methane is regularly measured in the atmosphere by one of the satellites of the European Union Space Programme's Copernicus mission.The spacecraft scans the entire globe, but its resolution is in the order of several kilometers, making it hard to zero in on the exact source.That's where private companies can step in.One of them, the Canadian GHGSat, currently has nine small satellites in orbit, each the size of a microwave. Their mission: to fly over oil and gas sites, looking for methane leaks. By orbiting at a lower altitude, they can take a detailed look at each site.\"Think of it as the wide angle lens camera, versus the telephoto lens camera,\" Stephane Germain, the company's founder, told AFP. The Copernicus team is in constant touch with GHGSat, telling them where to point their cameras.                Canadian company GHGSat uses a group of small satellites to monitor methane emissions.             GHGSat then sells its information to oil companies, such as Total, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Shell.\"More and more companies are interested in that because they're realizing they have to better understand their own carbon footprints,\" said Germain, especially since their customers are insisting on better accounting of emissions' life cycles.A common source of methane emissions are unlit flares, which are meant to burn off the gas.GHGSat estimates it has prevented the equivalent of 10 megatons of carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere, equivalent to 1.3 million homes' energy use for a year.Other companies plan to enter the sector, including France's Absolut Sensing. Another company, Kayrros, has no satellites of its own but is analyzing Copernicus data to track down the biggest leaks.Technological advances\"The big picture shows you that there is a problem. And the small one then focuses in higher resolution and sells information to somebody. So this works very well together,\" European Space Agency director Josef Aschbacher said of such public-private partnerships to AFP.                NASA recently launched the SWOT mission to survey the Earth's surface water in unprecedented detail.             But government agency constellations\u2014comprised of mostly large, very expensive satellites\u2014remain the backbone of the Earth observation system.Copernicus will soon enter a new era, with new missions such as CO2M measuring the carbon dioxide released specifically by human activities. NASA has about thirty Earth observation missions.In the last six months alone, the US space agency has launched the SWOT mission to survey the Earth's surface water in unprecedented detail, TEMPO to measure pollutants in the troposphere above North America, and TROPICS, to track tropical weather systems, including hurricanes, hour by hour.Advances in technology make it possible to measure today what was thought impossible just five or 10 years ago, said Aschbacher.      Better forecastsIn addition to these scientific missions, meteorological satellites, such as those overseen by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), play a vital role.Their data, collected over decades, have revealed stark shifts to global climate systems: from warming sea and land temperatures to receding Antarctic ice sheets, helping feed the models climate science relies on today.                Hurricane Ian approaching Florida, as seen by a NOAA satellite.             But increasingly, they can also help play a major role in adapting to a heating world. To mitigate the impact of increasingly frequent natural disasters, \"you've got to provide better forecasts,\" NOAA's chief scientist Mitch Goldberg told AFP.The agency has been increasing its partnerships with the private sector. For example, it has teamed up with the company GeoOptics to collect information on the humidity or the temperature of the atmosphere.According to a report by Inmarsat and Globant, if current satellite technologies were universally adopted, they could reduce carbon emissions by 5.5 gigatons\u2014quadrupling current reductions of 1.5 gigatons enabled by the sector.These savings could be achieved by, for example, helping the aviation and maritime sectors decarbonize through voyage optimization, weather routing and air traffic control management.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Private satellites give boost to public sector in climate fight (2023, May 18)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-private-satellites-boost-sector-climate.html  This document is subject to copyright.

The fires that have devastated the oil-producing Alberta province have in recent days spread to neighboring British Columbia and Saskatchewan as well as the Northwest Territories.Some 2,500 firefighters from across Canada backed by 400 military personnel have been deployed across Alberta to try to tame the wildfires, which have already burned more than half a million hectares of forests and grasslands and destroyed many homes and businesses.But they aren't enough, officials said.\"It's still a very significant and dangerous situation in Alberta,\" federal Public Safety Minister Bill Blair told reporters in Ottawa.Blair said the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center \"is reaching out to foreign countries\u2014the United States, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand... We're asking them to come and help us.\"Smoke from the wildfires has blanketed western Canada, leading to warnings about poor air quality posing risks to health.In Calgary, the sky had an orange hue to it as the smoke grew thicker throughout the day.Hundreds of kilometers (miles) to the east, residents of Regina and Saskatoon in neighboring Saskatchewan province said they woke up to a thick haze and a strong smell of smoke in the air.Across the region, almost 180 wildfires were burning\u2014including 48 out of control\u2014forcing tens of thousands to flee over the past two weeks.Evacuation orders and alerts were lifted in some parts on Tuesday and Wednesday, including hard-hit Drayton Valley west of Edmonton in Alberta and Fort St. John in British Columbia, as those fires were subdued.Air quality indexes in several cities, however, indicated wildfire smoke that spread from the Pacific Coast to Manitoba province still poses a \"very high risk\" to health.In recent years, western Canada has been hit repeatedly by extreme weather, the intensity and frequency of which have increased due to global warming.This has brought floods and mudslides, forest fires that destroyed an entire town, and record-high summer temperatures that killed more than 500 people in 2021.This spring's mostly hot, dry weather has resulted in what Alberta leader Danielle Smith described as an \"unprecedented\" crisis.As evacuees trickled back to Drayton Valley, local fire Chief Tom Thomson urged caution.\"There are still extremely hazardous areas...

  "answer_squad": " Rodrigo Agostinho",
  "text": "Brazil's environmental regulator refused on Wednesday to grant a license for a controversial offshore oil drilling project near the mouth of the Amazon River, prompting celebration from environmentalists who had warned of its potential impact.          The decision to reject the state-run oil company Petrobras' request to drill the FZA-M-59 block was made \"as a function of a group of technical inconsistencies,\" said the agency's president, Rodrigo Agostinho, who highlighted environmental concerns.With Brazil's existing production set to peak in coming years, Petrobras has sought to secure more reserves off Brazil's northern coast. The company earmarked almost half its five-year, $6 billion exploration budget for the area.CEO Jean Paul Prates had said that the first well would be temporary and that the company has never recorded a leak in offshore drilling. The company failed to convince the environmental agency.\"There is no doubt that Petrobras was offered every opportunity to remedy critical points of its project, but that it still presents worrisome inconsistencies for the safe operation in a new exploratory frontier with high socioenvironmental vulnerability,\" Agostinho wrote in his decision.The unique and biodiverse area is home to little-studied swaths of mangroves and a coral reef, and activists and experts had said the project risked leaks that could imperil the sensitive environment.Eighty civil society and environmental organizations, including WWF Brasil and Greenpeace, had called for the license to be rejected pending an in-depth study.\"Agostinho is protecting a virtually unknown ecosystem and maintains the coherence of the Lula government, which has promised in its discourse to be guided by the fight against the climate crisis,\" the Climate Observatory, a network of environmental non-profits, said in a statement.During the first presidential terms of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, from 2003 to 2010, huge offshore discoveries became a means of financing health, education and welfare programs. Some members of his Workers' Party continue to see oil as a means to ensure social progress.Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira said in March that the area is the \"passport to the future\" for development in Brazil's northern region. In his prior terms, Lula used the same phrase to describe the offshore oil discoveries in an area known as pre-salt.But Lula has strived to demonstrate the environmental awakening he has undergone in the years since, with protection of the Amazon a fixture in his campaign last year to unseat Jair Bolsonaro and return to the presidency.Activists and experts had warned that approval for the offshore oil project could threaten the natural world, but also dent Lula's newfound image as an environmental defender.The process to obtain an environmental license for the FZA-M-59 block began in 2014, at the request of BP Energy do Brasil. Exploration rights were transferred to Petrobras in 2020.Suely Ara\u00fajo, a former head of the environment agency and now a public policy specialist with the Climate Observatory, said Agostinho made the right call not just for the specific project, but also for the nation.\"The decision in this case gives cause for a broader debate about the role of oil in the country's future. It is time to establish a calendar to eliminate fossil fuels and accelerate the just transition for oil exporting countries, such as Brazil, and not open a new exploration frontier,\" Ara\u00fajo said in a statement. \"Those who sleep today dreaming of oil wealth tend to wake up tomorrow with a stranded asset, or an ecological disaster, or both.\"Other controversial megaprojects in the Amazon that remain on the table include repaving a highway that would slice through preserved rainforest, construction of a major railway for grain transport and renewal of a giant hydroelectric dam's license.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

  "question_squad": " What is the most commonly used pharmaceuticals in the world?",
  "answer_squad": " NSAIDs",
  "text": "Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) have attracted massive attention due to their large quantity of consumption, continuous discharge, and ecological risk to aquatic organisms in the receiving aquatic environments.          The Pearl River basin serves as an important source of drinking water for many cities in southern China. Prof. Bin Yang from the South China Normal University and their team members have worked jointly and comprehensively investigated the occurrence, fate, and environmental risk of 40 PhACs from surface waters and sediments in the Beijiang River, Xijiang River, and Maozhou River of the Pearl River basin, South China. Major classes of PhACs in this study included NSAIDs, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and antihypertension drugs. In addition, the seasonal and temporal variations in the concentrations of these PhACs among and between different rivers, along with the environmental risk were evaluated.Their analysis is published in the journal Frontiers of Environmental Science & Engineering on April 15, 2023.Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) are widely used in humans and veterinaries to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases. Major groups of PhACs include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antidepressants, anxiolytics, and hypertension medicines. Most of these drugs have been regarded as emerging organic contaminants in aquatic ecosystems.PhACs have been frequently detected in surface waters throughout the world at concentrations range of ng/L to \u03bcg/L over the past decades. The primary sources of PhACs to aquatic environments are effluents from the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), wastewaters from livestock and poultry industries, and sewage wastewater containing optionally disposal of expired or unused drugs.Among the PhACs, NSAIDs are one of the most frequently used pharmaceuticals globally, and listed among the top 10 persistent pollutants. Widely detected NSAIDs in aquatic environments include ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, ketoprofen, and salicylic acid. Meanwhile, psychotropic pharmaceuticals (PPhs) are widely consumed in the developed countries. Antidepressants and anxiolytics are the most widely detected PPhs in aquatic environments. Numerous studies have shown that many PhACs are toxic to aquatic organisms. Therefore, the environmental risk of PhACs cannot be simply ignored.      The Pearl River basin serves as an important source of drinking water for many cities in southern China. Previous research on the pollution of PhACs in the Pearl River basin has been conducted with one or two sampling campaigns along one main stream with recognized sources of PhACs contamination. This approach could not provide a complete understanding on variations in the frequency of occurrence and the environmental risk of PhACs. Moreover, data on PhACs for multiple rivers in the Pearl River basin by one sampling campaign in each of two seasons in a year are of relatively paucity. The work of Professor Bin Yang's team fills this gap.In this study, the research team found the average concentrations of detected PhACs in surface waters and sediments ranged from 0.17 to 19.1 ng/L and 0.10 to 10.4 ng/g, respectively. Meanwhile, PhACs concentration in surface waters and sediments varied greatly among and within the Beijiang River, Xijiang River, and Maozhou River. The largest annual flux of PhACs of the Xijiang River and Beijiang River was more than 11,000 kg per annum, whereas only 25.7 kg/a in the Maozhou River.In addition, the estimated emissions of PhACs in the Beijiang River, Xijiang River, and Maozhou River ranged respectively from 0.28 to 4.22 kg/a, 0.12 to 6.72 kg/a, and 6.66 to 91.0 kg/a, and the backestimated usage varied with a range from 12.0 to 293 kg/a, 6.79 to 944 kg/a, 368 to 17 459 kg/a. Moreover, the emissions of PhACs showed a close relationship with the gross domestic product (GDP) of each city along the Pearl River. The environmental risk assessment suggested that diazepam and ibuprofen had a moderate risk in this region.This study has revealed that PhACs are ubiquitous in the surface waters and sediments of the three major rivers of the Pearl River basin. The concentrations of commonly detected PhACs are comparable to those detected in many other river basins in China, and lower than in other countries. Meanwhile, there is a distinctive spatial and seasonal variation in PhACs occurrence profiles within and among the three river basins. This study can provide important data on the fate and environmental assessment of the PhACs in the Pearl River basin. It is pointed out that a multiple-year monitoring the pollution of PhACs is necessary for a complete understanding of the risk of PhACs in the Pearl River basin.

Six of the nine boundaries have already been crossed (see figure above). Crossing planetary boundaries increases the risk of large-scale abrupt or irreversible environmental changes.Systemic changes are neededDrastic changes are needed to ensure that the Earth remains habitable. In a keynote lecture, Jan Willem Erisman, Professor of Environmental Sustainability, said systemic changes are needed in food, energy and how we live and consume.

Planetary boundaries and social boundaries affect each other, and if we are to preserve a livable Earth, they must be addressed in an integrated way\u2014which is possible.Local solutionsOne approach that can help keep the Earth livable is to let communities come up with their own local solutions.

  "answer_squad": " ARIMA",
  "text": "A marine research team led by Professor Yan Qingyun has proposed a method to assess the net carbon sink of marine macroalgae (Gracilaria) cultivation. Then, they calculated the net carbon sink of Gracilaria cultivation in China based on the yield of annual cultivated Gracilaria in the last ten years.       Also, the net carbon sink trend of Gracilaria cultivation in the next ten years was predicted by the autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA). Finally, they explored the potential carbon sink increase and methane reduction related to Gracilaria cultivation in China through a scenario analysis.Their results suggested that the net carbon sink of Gracilaria cultivation in China was about 32.1-92.4 kilotons per year from 2011 to 2020, and showed a great annual growth trend. Specifically, the predicted average annual net carbon sink of Gracilaria cultivation from 2021 to 2030 would double that of the last ten years (i.e., increase to 77.8-191.4 kilotons per year).                The predicted average annual net carbon sink of Gracilaria cultivation from 2021 to 2030 tend to increase continuously, might have the potential to double that of last ten years and reach 191.4 kilotons in 2030. Credit: Science China Press             Thus, the Gracilaria cultivation could contribute considerably in the achievement of China's carbon peak goal. Moreover, under a scenario of producing ruminant green feed with additional Gracilaria cultivation, each ton of macroalgae was predicted to reduce carbon emission (i.e., methane) by 0.33-0.68 tons.In summary, marine macroalgae cultivation might form a synergistic chain of \"carbon sink increase-water purification-economy-methane reduction.\" A synergistic new model that operates through marine macroalgae cultivation, economic aquaculture, and green feed production was proposed in this study.The work is published in the journal Science China Earth Sciences.

This event was the biggest earthquake to strike the Eastern Anatolian Fault Zones (EAFZ) since the 1990s.To gain a timely and in-depth insight into the earthquakes, a team of researchers from the Institute of Earthquake Forecasting in Beijing, China, used high-resolution Maxar and GF-2 satellite data to obtain spatial interpretations of part of the rupture zone in the epicenter of this earthquake, as well as seismic landslides and soil liquefaction developed around the rupture zone.\"We searched for feature dislocations and measuring the amount of dislocations, which provided a timely and comprehensive understanding of the earthquake damage caused by this earthquake,\" said Yueren Xu, corresponding author of the study.The team initially interpreted a rupture zone of approximately 75 km in length and found that the surface showed a gradual widening of the spreading width and a gradual decrease in the amount of horizontal dislocations to immeasurable levels.\"Secondary hazards such as liquefaction are mainly found in rivers or low-lying terrain at the end of the rupture zone, and landslides are found in valley areas near the rupture zone,\" said Xu.The findings are published in the journal Earthquake Research Advances.The researchers proposed that earthquakes in Turkey will not have a direct response on significant magnitude seismic activity in western China. This is due to the continental collision involving various plates plus their contrastive seismically active zones throughout the world.\"Despite both China and Turkey being part of the same Eurasian seismic region, they variably exhibit tectonic mechanism dissimilarities,\" added Xu.

It affects water and soil characteristics that are relevant to both industry and science, including agriculture, fish farming, drinking water supply, carbon capture, climate studies, and more. The only technique that can provide an overview of all the molecules in an NOM sample from the environment or an industrial facility\u2014such as a fish farm\u2014is high-resolution mass spectrometry. It involves ionizing the compound mixture and measuring the constituent ions' frequency of rotation in a magnetic field to identify them by the mass-to-charge ratio.\"Theoretically, you should be able to take the results of your mass spec analysis and be able to look up the soil or water organics characteristics you want. You would query a database and find a reasonably similar sample studied in a lab elsewhere in the world. And you could expect your sample to have similar properties to those of the reference sample,\" said the principal investigator of the study, Senior Research Scientist Alexander Zherebker of Skoltech Bio's Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, which is headed by study co-author Professor Evgeny Nikolaev.\"But there are two problems,\" the researcher went on. \"First, such a database does not exist, or did not. Second, study after study has shown that for reasons having to do with sample complexity and instrument features, two different labs will very likely report strikingly different compositions for one and the same sample.\"      To address this, Zherebker and his colleagues are proposing an alternative metric for characterizing NOM samples, which they found to be resistant to measurement errors and the minor distinctions known to exist between different mass spectrometry labs and hardware. The team also established and published a first-of-its-kind open database that will accumulate data on NOM samples characterized using the new metric.The newly proposed metric abandons the attempt to capture the precise molecular composition of the sample. Instead, the researchers are specifying the NOM profile by looking at the source materials and products of a large number of chemical reactions known to occur in the environment.Sure, this metric could not be used in some cases, for example to analyze the individual byproducts resulting from water disinfection. \"But then again, such projects are often comfortably accomplished within a single laboratory, so the traditional approach will do,\" Zherebker said. \"On the flip side, we have demonstrated that our metric enables two samples to be directly compared almost irrespective of where and by which group the data were collected, unlocking the so far unrealized potential of mass spectrometry in this domain.\"As of now, the prototype database created by the authors of the study and freely available online only amounts to 14 samples and certainly requires expansion. That said, it already has multiple samples from various soil types and rivers from across the globe, and even one from an Antarctic lake. These are representative in the sense that they are the products of very different biogeochemical processes. The Antarctic sample, for example, is devoid of the plant-related components.Besides serving as a reference for predicting the properties of an arbitrary sample by comparison, the database could also be of use for assessing measurement quality. \"If a laboratory runs the analysis on a well-studied reference sample and gets unexpected results, this means something's gone wrong and some corrections are in order for further measurements of unfamiliar samples to be deemed sound,\" Zherebker said.

  "text": "Summer in India has always been hot. Increasingly, it's testing the limits of human survival. As temperatures have climbed across the world's most populous nation in recent weeks, more than a dozen people died at an event in central India and thousands crowded hospitals with heatstroke symptoms. Hundreds of schools were closed and the mercury is still rising: Temperatures will hover around 45C (113F) across the northern plains this weekend.          The most immediate fix is mercifully affordable, at least in the short-term.Demand for air conditioners is surging in markets where both incomes and temperatures are rising, populous places like India, China, Indonesia and the Philippines.By one estimate, the world will add 1 billion ACs before the end of the decade. The market is projected to nearly double before 2040. That's good for measures of public health and economic productivity; it's unquestionably bad for the climate, and a global agreement to phase out the most harmful coolants could keep the appliances out of reach of many of the people who need them most.The logic behind the AC boom is simple. Economists note a spike in sales when annual household incomes near $10,000, a tipping point many of the world's hottest places touched recently or will soon. The Philippines passed the $10,000 threshold roughly last year; Indonesia within the last decade. In India, where more than 80% of the population doesn't yet have access to air conditioning, per capita gross domestic product\u2014adjusted for purchasing power\u2014will top $9,000 this year for the first time.\"We are operating in a limitless opportunity,\" said Kanwaljeet Jawa, who heads the India wing of Daikin Industries Ltd, the world's largest AC manufacturer. In recent years, he said, \"our sales have grown more than 15 times.\"This development has far-reaching consequences for public health, well-being and economic growth. Purchasing an AC is a pivot away from poverty for individuals and for their communities. People in hotter countries, which also tend to be poorer ones, suffer from worse sleep and impaired cognitive performance, both of which drag on productivity and output.In a study looking at thousands of Indian factories with different cooling arrangements, researchers found that productivity fell by around 2% for every degree Celsius increase. This is a big deal for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's push to boost sluggish export numbers, lure business from China and move up the global value chain: The declines due to heat over the past 30 years may equate to roughly 1% of India's GDP, or about $32 billion, according to E. Somanathan, author of the report and a professor of economics at ISI Delhi.      But expanding AC coverage too quickly also threatens to worsen the crisis it's responding to. Most units use a refrigerant that's far more damaging than carbon dioxide. The nations where demand is growing fastest remain deeply reliant on coal-fired power, and most people can only afford the cheapest, most energy-inefficient units.If efficiency standards don't improve, \"then the planet will literally be cooked,\" said Abhas Jha, a World Bank expert on climate change based in Singapore.Wealthier, more temperate countries have tightened regulations on ACs, requiring better energy efficiency and less-toxic coolants. That adds to the cost of units, making those kinds of measures less palatable where affordability is paramount. International climate bodies are pressuring developing countries to lower their carbon footprint, but India and its peers point out that they still contribute far less to global emissions than places like the U.S., where nine out of ten people have access to AC.\"We're facing a situation where extraordinarily harsh conditions are being imposed on growing economies,\" said Jos\u00e9 Guillermo Cede\u00f1o Laurent, an assistant professor of public health at Rutgers University in New Jersey.In Delhi's working-class neighborhoods, these debates are abstractions. For many, access to an AC is a matter of survival. Piyu Haldar, who works as a maid, said her shanty turns into a furnace in the summer. The tin roof gets hot enough to cook roti on it. Before sleeping, Haldar and her husband used to splash water on their bed to cool down the room.When her son was born in 2016, he suffered fevers from the heat. That was the breaking point. To afford an entry-level Voltas AC, Haldar stopped buying clothing, cut down on meals, took out a loan and doubled the number of houses she cleaned.Haldar, 27, avoids turning on the unit during the day. But as night falls, she flips on the switch and closes the door, keeping the mosquitoes out and preserving the cool air. In a windowless bedroom decorated with teddy bears and toys, her son, Yasir, pushed his face against the AC, delighting in the \"cold chilled air!\"\"Relatives visit just to sit next to it,\" Haldar said. \"People think we've become very fancy.\" Since purchasing the AC, she and her husband have more energy in the day, she said, and Yasir no longer falls sick from the heat.As more people like Haldar buy ACs, cooling companies are trying to improve energy efficiency without pricing out their biggest growth markets. Most G-20 nations, including India, use labeling systems to rate the efficiency of products, and stricter standards in the U.S. and European Union have lowered energy use from appliances by 15% in recent years, according to BloombergNEF.Haldar chose a three-star unit from Voltas, which cost about 27,000 rupees ($330), or roughly 15% less than comparable higher efficiency options. Three-star units comprise about 60% of total AC sales at Godrej Appliances, one of India's largest retailers, said business head Kamal Nandi. One way to encourage consumers to buy more efficient models, the company says, would be to lower taxes on the units to 18%, down from the 28% luxury tariff that currently applies. \"The AC has become a necessity,\" Nandi said. \"It is no longer a luxury item.\"For cooling companies like Daikin and Haier, the growing demand for ACs could be quashed by regulation designed to slow climate change. Part of the problem will be solved if and when countries move toward cleaner sources of power. The other issue\u2014the refrigerants that turn that electricity into cool air\u2014is trickier.One of the most common coolants, hydrofluorocarbons, can have 1,000 times the warming potency of carbon dioxide. Scientists estimate that failing to drastically lower dependence on HFCs could result in half a degree Celsius of warming by the end of the century, an enormous contribution to a rise that would trigger deadlier storms, droughts and, yes, more heatwaves.In 2016, more than 170 nations agreed to start phasing out HFCs beginning in 2019, with wealthy industrial countries required to make the first deep cuts. There are less environmentally harmful coolants on the market, made by Chemours Co. and Honeywell International Inc. Daikin and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation are working on their own products.\"If you don't have a green refrigerant, you are going to be the loser,\" said Jawa, the chief executive of Daikin India, which became a billion-dollar company last financial year and expects to double that number within three more.Cooling companies are hunting for new options. Daikin's R-32 has approximately one-third the global warming potential of conventional refrigerants and is cheaper than some other coolants; it's become common in appliances sold by big retailers such as Godrej. But it's also a bit more flammable than older refrigerants and, according to Prima Madan, an expert on cooling and energy efficiency at the US-based Natural Resources Defense Council, still too polluting.The Kigali Amendment to phase out HFCs is legally binding, and though many of its goals are still far in the future, developed nations have picked up the pace. While R-32 has \"helped avoid a large chunk of emissions,\" Madan said, \"we do need to go lower.\"As of now, though, the alternatives are often more expensive. That's prompted opposition even in wealthy countries. The U.S. senate recently agreed to reduce HFC consumption by 85% within 15 years, and the conservative Heritage Foundation has warned Americans to get \"ready to pay a lot more for air conditioning.\"For India, the challenge is to implement cleaner technology before millions of new consumers purchase the dirtier ACs, locking in their use for another decade. Last year, the country logged some of its hottest weeks since 1901. Brutal heatwaves pushed temperatures to 50C (122F) on the subcontinent. The worst stretches killed hundreds of people, led to hours-long power outages and even caused a giant landfill on the outskirts of India's capital to spontaneously combust.Naresh Tatavet, a personal driver in Delhi, is among those who've had enough. This month, he bought his young family their first AC, calling it one of the biggest financial investments he's ever made\u2014on par with purchasing a motorbike. In his neighborhood, after somebody purchases an AC, \"we bring them sweets to celebrate.\"Whatever happens in Washington, Brussels and other faraway places, Tatavet is sure of one thing: His family won't go back. He can no longer watch his baby throw up from the heat.\"I don't want to wake up drenched in sweat anymore,\" he said.    2023 Bloomberg L.P. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "text": "New research led by the University of Oxford has found that climate change is causing the hottest days in North-West Europe to warm at double the rate of average summer days. The difference in trends is most pronounced for England, Wales, and Northern France. Worryingly, while current climate models accurately predict the rate of warming for average days, they underestimate the rate at which the hottest days are warming compared to observations.          According to lead researcher Dr. Matthew Patterson, from the University of Oxford's Department of Physics, the results indicate that extreme heat events\u2014such as the UK's record-breaking heatwave last summer\u2014are likely to become more regular.Dr. Patterson said, \"These findings underline the fact that the UK and neighboring countries are already experiencing the effects of climate change, and that last year's heatwave was not a fluke. Policy makers urgently need to adapt their infrastructure and health systems to cope with the impacts of higher temperatures.\"For the study, published today in Geographical Research Letters, Dr. Patterson analyzed data from the past 60 years (1960-2021) recording the maximum daily temperature, provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.Although the maximum recorded temperature varied between years, the overall trend clearly showed that the hottest days for North-West Europe had warmed at twice the rate of average summer days. For England and Wales, the average summer day increased by approximately 0.26\u00b0C per decade, while the hottest day increased by around 0.58\u00b0C per decade. However, this faster warming of the hottest days was not observed to this extent elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere.The reason causing this faster warming of the hottest days relative to average summer days is not yet understood. According to Dr. Patterson, this may be due to the hottest summer days in North-West Europe often being linked to hot air transported north from over Spain.Because Spain is warming faster than North-West Europe, this means that air carried in from this region is ever more extreme relative to the ambient air in North-West Europe. The hottest days of 2022, for instance, were driven by a plume of hot air carried north from Spain and the Sahara. However, further research is needed to verify this.Dr. Patterson added, \"Understanding the warming rate of the hottest days will be important if we are to improve climate model simulation of extreme events and make accurate predictions about the future intensity of such events. If our models underestimate the rise in extreme temperatures over the coming decades, we will underestimate the impacts this will have.\"Extreme heat has significant negative impacts on many different aspects of society, including energy and transport infrastructure, and agriculture. It also exacerbates conditions including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, putting a strain on health services.The current UK Government has been criticized by the Climate Change Committee (CCC) for failing to act quickly enough to adapt for the impacts of global heating. These new findings add even more urgency for policy makers to adapt infrastructure and systems vulnerable to extreme heat.

Science and industry seek mineral deposits to both better understand the history of our planet and to extract for use in technologies like rechargeable batteries.       Shaunna Morrison, Anirudh Prabhu, and colleagues sought to create a tool for finding occurrences of specific minerals, a task that has long been as much an art as a science, relying on individual experience, along with a healthy dose of luck.The team created a machine learning model that uses data from the Mineral Evolution Database, which includes 295,583 mineral localities of 5,478 mineral species, to predict previously unknown mineral occurrences based on association rules. The authors tested their model by exploring the Tecopa basin in the Mojave Desert, a well-known Mars analog environment.The model was also able to predict the locations of geologically important minerals, including uraninite alteration, rutherfordine, andersonite, and schr\u00f6ckingerite, bayleyite and zippeite.In addition, the model located promising areas for critical rare earth element and lithium minerals, including monazite-(Ce), and allanite-(Ce), and spodumene.

  "answer_squad": " Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia",
  "text": "In areas of Colombia once controlled by guerillas, conflicts over land continue and deforestation has risen considerably. But it's in these same areas that researchers have found that farmers implementing sustainable land use systems, like agroforestry driven by cocoa (one of the key ingredients of chocolate), has contributed to reducing conflicts.          In 2016, the government of Colombia signed a peace treaty with the guerilla group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC, for its initials in Spanish) and in the following years, forested areas formerly controlled by the FARC saw an influx of other illegal actors, contributing to deforestation and renewed instability.In the first quarter of 2022, 50,400 hectares were deforested across Colombia, an increase over the 45,500 hectares deforested in the same period in 2021, according to Colombia's Ministry of Environment.In a new paper, \"Integrating climate mitigation and environmental peacebuilding objectives through sustainable land use systems: Theory of change and indicators,\" published in the journal PLOS Climate researchers from the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT found that land is an essential natural resource for climate mitigation and peace; commonly connected with sources of greenhouse gas emissions and with drivers of violent conflict.The researchers held workshops in the C\u00e9sar and Caquet\u00e1 departments (states) in Colombia about sustainable land-use systems (SLUS), in particular, cocoa agroforestry, as an environmentally and economically sustainable activity.H\u00e9ctor Morales-Mu\u00f1oz, a visiting scholar at the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT at the time of the workshops and the paper's lead author, said that the results from these workshops are building up evidence for peacebuilding, that is the implementation of agricultural interventions intended to reduce pressure on forests, especially in an area affected by conflict.\"In environmental peacebuilding there's an approach called the contact hypothesis, which says, that contact, or putting conflicting parties together to talk about environmental issues or agricultural practices, typically reduces prejudice, enabling them to have a neutral space for dialogue, for them to start to create a lasting trust,\" Morales-Mu\u00f1oz said.                Cocoa, like these beans being processed at the Association of Agricultural Producers in La Paz, Cesar, are part of a fairly new value chain in the region. Credit: Valentina Yomayuza             Conflict, land and climateMorales-Mu\u00f1oz explained that sustainable land use systems (SLUS) provided a starting point.\"The farmers gained access to knowledge, seeds and different forms of capital and in return they had to conserve part of the forest and this also started a community dialogue process,\" he said,\"What is also critical, and what no-one was expecting, was that climate mitigation came into the conversation.\"Morales-Mu\u00f1oz said that the diversification in cocoa also protects farmers from getting into illegal spaces.\"Cocoa is a relatively new value chain, so they are more able to negotiate a fairer price for their produce,\" he said.In the paper, the researchers found that cocoa agroforestry can contribute to climate change mitigation and deliver co-benefits in creating jobs and diversifying livelihoods; allowing negotiations around the design of farms, including conservation agreements; natural resource governance; and an interchange of knowledge and experience.One feature of the study was including perception indicators to measure the impacts of cocoa agroforestry in peacebuilding. In a survey of 429 farmer households involved in cocoa agroforestry in Caquet\u00e1 and 500 in Cesar, the researchers found that participants felt that agroforestry systems had increased the spaces for community dialogue.A majority of farmers also considered that SLUS decreased disputes over access to natural resources in their environment.      Implications beyond ColombiaAugusto Castro-Nu\u00f1ez, a senior scientist at the Alliance of Bioversity and CIAT, global theme leader for low-emissions food systems (and leader of the SLUS project which produced the paper) said that the government of Kenya has already shown interest in working with the CGIAR Initiative on Low Emissions Food Systems on approaches for linking climate change mitigation with peace efforts.\"We are planning to scale out the approach to other countries also experiencing conflicts with potential to reduce emissions from the AFOLU (agriculture, forestry and other land uses) sector,\" Castro-Nu\u00f1ez said.Castro-Nu\u00f1ez explained that the work in Caquet\u00e1 and Cesar helped inspire the CGIAR initiative called AgriLAC Resiliente, where researchers are working to develop a theory of changes and indicators for linking climate change mitigation and other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\"This is because although a good deal of the countries with potential for reducing emissions from the land sector are experiencing conflict, and therefore peacebuilding is a development priority, some countries have other development priorities such as biodiversity or improved nutrition,\" Castro-Nu\u00f1ez said.

  "text": "A new computer modeling technique developed by scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) offers the potential to generate months-ahead summertime drought forecasts across the Western United States with the capability of differentiating between dry conditions at locations just a couple of miles apart.          The technique uses statistical methods and machine learning to analyze key drought indicators during the winter and spring and correlate them with the likelihood of dryness throughout the landscape the following summer. The scientists say this approach, if adapted for use by forecasters, could provide important information for such priorities as management of water resources, wildland fire and fuels, and agriculture.\"This approach forecasts drought conditions before they have the largest impact,\" said NCAR scientist Ronnie Abolafia-Rosenzweig, the lead author of a new paper describing the technique. \"It gives managers an additional tool that they can use to prepare and guide the decisions they are making.\"Abolafia-Rosenzweig and his co-authors found that predictions issued one to three months in advance could correctly identify the occurrence of summer drought in about 81%\u201394% of cases at a resolution of 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) across the rugged and often parched western third of the United States.The predictions proved most accurate in regions of persistent drought, showing how upcoming dry conditions may vary from a cultivated field to a nearby mountainside or forested area. In regions where dry spells were punctuated by periods of heavy summer precipitation, however, the predictions proved less accurate.The scientists detailed their findings in a recent article in Water Resources Research.Strengthening societal resilienceDroughts can have devastating health and economic impacts, costing the United States at least $249 billion since 1980 and setting the stage for widespread fires. In the West, the period from 2000\u20132021 was the driest 22-year stretch since at least the year 800, according to tree ring data. In 2021 alone, the drought and associated heat waves led to hundreds of deaths in the region.To strengthen societal resilience, scientists are working to improve computer modeling techniques that produce months-ahead predictions of drought. Current drought forecasts, however, have a relatively coarse resolution of, at best, about 10 kilometers, which does not adequately capture the varying degrees of drying across different landscape features in the West.      But a new dataset that NCAR scientists recently produced in collaboration with the U.S. Geological Survey helped open the way for more detailed drought forecasts. The dataset is named CONUS404 because it contains simulations of hydrological and climate conditions at 4-kilometer resolution across the continental United States (or CONUS) over the past 40-plus years. Abolafia-Rosenzweig and his co-authors also drew on an equally high-resolution U.S. Department of Agriculture dataset, known as PRISM (Parameter elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model) for meteorological observations.These datasets enabled the scientists to identify complex relationships, at a 4-kilometer resolution, between climate and drought conditions in late fall and winter and the extent of drying during the following summer. To identify these relationships, they used machine learning techniques that trained specialized statistical models.The scientists focused on pre-summer climate variables such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity, as well as distant ocean-atmosphere patterns such as the Pacific Multidecadal Oscillation that have far-reaching effects on climate. They found that commonly used drought measures, the Palmer Drought Severity Index and Soil Moisture Percentiles, have strong persistence from winter and spring into the summer, making pre-summer drought severity an especially important predictor of summer drought conditions.Abolafia-Rosenzweig said the drought forecasting method can augment a fire prediction technique that he and his co-authors had developed last year. Combining the drought and fire models offers the potential for a very detailed look at fire hazard across the West.\"The West is in a very unique period in terms of both drought and fire with records being broken that go back thousands of years,\" he said. \"The climate projections are showing drought conditions will continue to intensify in the future. Having tools that can better inform management is becoming increasingly important.\" More information:Ronnie Abolafia\u2010Rosenzweig et al, High Resolution Forecasting of Summer Drought in the Western United States, Water Resources Research (2023).

  "text": "The U.S. government is planning to crack down on power plants' greenhouse gas emissions, and, as a result, a lot of money is about to pour into technology that can capture carbon dioxide from smokestacks and lock it away.          That raises an important question: Once carbon dioxide is captured and stored, how do we ensure it stays put?Power plants that burn fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas, release a lot of carbon dioxide. As that CO\u2082 accumulates in the atmosphere, it traps heat near the Earth's surface, driving global warming.But if CO\u2082 emissions can be captured instead and locked away for thousands of years, existing fossil fuel power plants could meet the proposed new federal standards and reduce their impact on climate change.We work on carbon capture and storage technologies and policies as a scientist and an engineer. One of us, Klaus Lackner, proposed a tenet more than two decades ago that is echoed in the proposed standards: For all carbon extracted from the ground, an equal amount must be disposed of safely and permanently.To ensure that happens, carbon capture and storage needs an effective certification system.EPA's proposed carbon crackdownThe proposed new power plant rules, announced by the Environmental Protection Agency on May 11, 2023, are based on performance standards for carbon dioxide releases. They aren't yet finalized, and they likely will face fierce legal challenges, but the industry is paying attention.Power plant owners could meet the proposed standards in any number of ways, including by shutting down fossil fuel-powered plants and replacing them with renewable energy such as solar or wind.For those planning to continue to burn natural gas or coal, however, capturing the emissions and storing them long term is the most likely option.      How CCS works for power plantsCarbon capture typically starts at the smokestack with chemical \"scrubbers\" that can remove more than 90% of carbon dioxide emissions. The captured CO\u2082 is compressed and sent through pipelines for storage.At most storage sites, CO\u2082 is injected into underground reservoirs, typically in porous rocks more than 3,300 feet (1,000 meters) below the surface.Geologists look for sites with multiple layers of protection, including impermeable rock layers above the reservoir that can prevent gas from leaking out. In some sites, CO\u2082 chemically reacts with minerals and is eventually immobilized as a solid carbonate.                Several regions of the U.S. have geological reservoirs with the potential to store captured carbon dioxide. Credit: Environmental Protection Agency             Carbon capture and storage is currently expensive, and developing the pipeline and storage infrastructure will likely take years. But as more CCS projects are built\u2014helped by some generous tax credits in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act\u2014costs are likely to drop.The Sleipner project in the North Sea has been putting away roughly 1 million metric tons of CO\u2082 a year since 1996. In Iceland, CO\u2082 is injected into volcanic basalt rocks, where it reacts with the stone and rapidly forms solid mineral carbonates.In the U.S., companies have been injecting CO\u2082 into underground reservoirs for decades\u2014initially, as a way to force more oil out of the ground. Today, these \"enhanced oil recovery\" projects can receive tax credits for the CO\u2082 that remains underground. As a result, some now inject more carbon into the ground than they extract as oil.While there have been no notable CO\u2082 releases from geologic storage, other gas storage leaks demonstrate that injection has to follow well-defined safety rules. Nothing is guaranteed.That's why monitoring and certification are essential.How to effectively certify carbon storageThe EPA has rules for CO\u2082 storage sites, but they are focused on protecting drinking water rather than the climate. Under those rules, monitoring is required for all phases of the project and for 50 years after closing to check the safety of the groundwater and ensure that material injected underground does not contaminate it.However, the current monitoring techniques don't measure the amount of carbon stored, and the rules do not require that leaked carbon be replaced.To provide more direction, we developed a certification framework designed to ensure that all carbon is stored safely and for the tens of thousands of years necessary to safeguard the climate.We envision liability for the captured carbon dioxide shifting from the power plant owner to the storage site operator once the carbon dioxide is transferred. That would mean the storage site operator would be held liable for any leaks.Under the framework, a certificate authority would vet storage operators and issue certificates of carbon sequestration for stored carbon. These certificates could have market value if, as the EPA suggests, power plant operators are held responsible for the carbon stored. Future regulations could expand this requirement to other emitters, or simply demand that any carbon released is cleared by a corresponding certificate showing the same amount of carbon has been sequestered.Careful monitoring, paired with certification that requires storage site owners to make up any losses, could help avoid greenwashing and ensure that the investments meet the nation's climate goals.Certification can be useful for carbon stored in any quantifiable storage reservoir, including trees, oceans and human infrastructure such as cement. We believe a universal approach to certification that sets minimum requirements and responsibilities is necessary to assure that carbon is stored safely with a guarantee of permanence, regardless of how it is done.Climate change will cost trillions of dollars, and the federal government is putting billions into research and tax breaks to encourage development of carbon capture and storage sites. To avoid dubious methods, corner-cutting and greenwashing, carbon storage will have to be held to high standards. The U.S. can't afford to pin a large chunk of its climate strategy on carbon storage without proof.

  "text": "Manganese nodules at the bottom of the deep sea contain a wealth of valuable metals that are vital to the electronics and steelmaking industries. Accordingly, these sectors and many countries have pinned their hopes on deep-sea mining to meet the growing demand for raw materials like cobalt and rare-earth elements.          In a study just released in the journal Scientific Reports, experts from the Alfred Wegener Institute show that such activities could not only have ecological impacts, but also pose health hazards, for example, in connection with the industrial mining and processing of the nodules. According to their findings, in some cases, the radioactivity of radium-226 in the nodules exceeds the safe limit defined in the German Strahlenschutzverordnung (Radiation Protection Ordinance) 100- to 1,000-fold.Large areas of the ocean floor are covered with polymetallic nodules and crusts. The potato-sized manganese nodules can be found in all oceans, especially in the Pacific Ocean, at water depths between 4,000 and 6,000 meters. Formed over millions of years, they contain valuable metals like copper, nickel, cobalt and rare-earth elements\u2014in other words, a range of elements required for the manufacture of electronic products like computers, smartphones, batteries, magnets, motors and high-tech components.Accordingly, manganese nodules and deep-sea mining have increasingly gained the attention of industries and politicians over the past several years.Particularly large quantities of manganese nodules can be found in the deep ocean of the Clarion Clipperton Zone in the North Pacific Ocean between Mexico and Hawaii. Several countries\u2014including the Federal Republic of Germany\u2014have secured exploration licenses for the zone, entitling them to first gather reference data in the license areas and, on this basis, assess the potential ecological impacts of commercial deep-sea mining of manganese nodules.In July 2023, the International Seabed Authority (ISA) plans to define concrete regulations for their industrial mining.\"Through the Joint Programming Initiative Oceans projects 'MiningImpact' and 'MiningImpact2' ... and as part of an international consortium bringing together more than 30 partner institutes, we've been investigating the potential impacts of deep-sea mining on the habitats and ecosystems of the sediments and water column in the Pacific Ocean since 2015,\" explains Prof Sabine Kasten, who leads the MiningImpact subprojects at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI).      \"Our new study on the radioactivity of manganese nodules demonstrates that, beyond the consequences for marine ecosystems, there could be human health hazards in connection with mining and processing of manganese nodules, and the use of products manufactured on this basis. It's imperative that this aspect is considered in all future planning.\"For their study, which was just released in the journal Scientific Reports, the AWI experts assessed manganese nodules retrieved in the framework of two expeditions (2015 and 2019) on board the Research Vessel SONNE in the Clarion Clipperton Zone.\"Based on previous studies it was already known that the nodules' outer layer contains natural radioactive substances like thorium-230 and radium-226, which have accumulated at the nodules' surface from seawater over long periods of time. However, their values had never been considered in the context of radiation protection legislation,\" says first author and biogeochemist Dr. Jessica Volz.\"Our study shows that in the outer layer of these extremely slowly growing nodules, certain substances, which emit alpha radiation can exceed limits found in radiation protection legislations a 100- to a 1,000-fold.\"In the case of radium-226, the AWI team repeatedly measured radioactivity levels of more than 5 becquerels per gram on the nodules' outer layer. For comparison: the limit set in Germany's Radiation Protection Ordinance is 0.01 becquerels per gram. Even when dealing with legacy pollution from uranium ore mining, depending on the situation, a detailed risk assessment is required when limits of 0.2 or 1 becquerel per gram are exceeded.\"Even though we expected high radioactivity levels in the nodules based on earlier studies, the levels that we actually measured still surprised us,\" explains AWI researcher and co-author Dr. Walter Geibert.\"In particular, the high accumulation rate of the radioactive noble gas radon was a new finding. As such, handling manganese nodules without protective gear can pose a health risk. It is not just through inhaling the dust produced during processing, but also the high radon concentrations that can build up when they are stored in poorly ventilated spaces. Some radioactive substances could accumulate in the nodule products during/after processing, such as actinium-227 in the rare-earth elements.\"In future studies, the experts plan to investigate whether manganese nodules from different deep-sea regions reach similar values, and how the ecological, economic and social risks of deep-sea mining and the commercial use of manganese nodules can be estimated on the basis of these new findings.

  "text": "A study published in Scientific Reports shows that catastrophic volcanic mudflows, known as lahars, can be effectively monitored with infrasound remote sensing technology.          Infrasound airwaves are low-frequency sounds below the threshold of human hearing that can propagate long distances. They may be used to detect small mudflows at distances of 5 kilometers or more. The signals can identify approaching mudflows when they are still more than 20 minutes away.Lahars are the most impactful of volcanic hazards. The 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, for example, killed more than 20,000 people when large lahars reached the flat valleys where the city of Armero was located.The recent research looked at signals from more than 20 small- to medium-sized lahars that occurred in 2022 at the active Fuego volcano in Guatemala, where regular lahars occur during the country's rainy season.\"This study is exciting because it adds to our arsenal of tools for early warning of volcanic mudflows before they reach and potentially impact downstream communities,\" said co-author and Boise State geologist Jeffrey Johnson.\"Infrasound signal analysis appears to have special utility to identify the early movement of mudflows high up on a volcano as they begin to flow toward exposed populations. Early warning is key for mitigation of hazards.\"The research team was fortunate, said Johnson, to record several lahars and to observe one medium-sized event firsthand.\"Lahars are one of the most common volcanic hazards but still one of the most poorly understood,\" said Eva Zanzerkia, a program director in NSF's Division of Earth Sciences. \"This project demonstrates that developing new infrasound tools can go a long way toward improving our understanding the dynamics of these mudflows and helping us manage the hazards.\" More information:J.

Sizzling temperatures of up to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) were recorded in monitoring stations in parts of India, Bangladesh, Thailand and Laos last month\u2014which was unusually high for the time of year.The climate change-fueled heat caused deaths, widespread hospitalizations, damaged roads, sparked fires and led to school closures in the region.The World Weather Attribution group uses established models to quickly determine whether climate change played a part in extreme weather events. While the studies themselves are not yet peer-reviewed, which is the gold standard for science, they are often later published in peer-reviewed journals.In Thailand, high temperatures mixed with humidity meant some parts of the country felt above 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit).

Currently, the world is around 1.1 to 1.2 degrees Celsius (2 to 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times.\"We see again and again that climate change dramatically increases the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, one of the deadliest weather events there are,\" said Friedrike Otto, a senior climate scientist at Imperial College London and one of the study's authors.Heat action plans\u2014which are government-run and funded and aim to help people deal with extreme heat through awareness programs, training for healthcare workers and affordable cooling methods\u2014need to be implemented faster in India and other heat-affected countries, the study's authors said.

  "text": "A trio of oceanologists at the University of Rhode Island working with a geologist colleague from USGS Moffett Field has found that the massive weight of buildings in New York City is contributing to its subsidence drop. In their study, reported in the journal Earth's Future, Pei-Chin Wu, Meng Wei, Steven D'Hondt and Tom Parsons calculated the total mass of the buildings that make up New York City and applied it to models that predict natural subsidence to estimate how much overall subsidence is likely to occur in the coming years.       Subsidence, in geological terms, is when land becomes lower in altitude due to underground settling or removal of material or water\u2014meaning, it sinks. Scientists have noted for many years that most coastal cities are slowly sinking due to settling and reductions in the water table. New York City, for example, has been sinking for many years, and likely will continue to do so in the future.Coastal areas are particularly at risk due to climate change, which is leading to sea level rise. Such areas, it is believed, are likely to face serious challenges in the near future. In this new effort, the research team noted that few, if any, estimates of subsidence for cities such as New York, take into account the massive weight of the buildings in downtown areas. In this new effort, they sought to overcome that problem for New York by adding up the weight of all of its buildings and factoring in its impact on subsidence.

Credit: Earth's Future (2023). DOI: 10.1029/2022EF003465             The work involved counting the buildings in New York City and making estimates of their weight and then adding them all together. The researchers arrived at a figure of 764,000,000,000 kilograms. Next, they divided the city into a 100 x 100 grid to calculate downward pressure from all the weight due to gravity. They then added that weight to natural ground weight on top of the conditions that are known to exist beneath New York City\u2014mostly silt, sand and clay lake deposits along with some bedrock outcrops. The team also added real-world subsidence rates for the past several decades courtesy of satellite measurements.Once complete, the model showed estimated subsidence rates for different parts of the city and also gave an average for the entire city\u20141 to 2 millimeters per year. They also found that some parts of the city are more at risk than others\u2014clay-rich soils, for example, and artificial fills were found to be more prone to subsidence than sand deposits or bedrock, which will not sink at all.

  "answer_squad": " two-out-of-three",
  "text": "There's a two-out-of-three chance that the world will temporarily hit a key warming limit within the next five years, the United Nations weather agency said Wednesday.          But it likely would only be a fleeting and less worrisome flirtation with the internationally agreed upon temperature threshold. Scientists expect a temporary burst of heat from El Nino\u2014a naturally-occurring weather phenomenon\u2014to supercharge human-caused warming from the burning of coal, oil and gas to new heights. Temperatures are expected to then slip back down a bit.The World Meteorological Organization forecasts a 66% likelihood that between now and 2027, the globe will have a year that averages 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the mid 19th century.That number is critical because the 2015 Paris climate agreement set 1.5 degrees Celsius as a global guardrail in atmospheric warming, with countries pledging to try to prevent that much long-term warming if possible.Scientists in a special 2018 United Nations report said going past that point would be drastically and dangerously different with more death, destruction and damage to global ecosystems.\"It won't be this year probably. Maybe it'll be next year or the year after\" that a year averages 1.5 degrees Celsius, said report lead author Leon Hermanson, a climate scientist at the United Kingdom's Met Office.But climate scientists said what's likely to happen in the next five years isn't the same as failing the global goal.\"This report does not mean that we will permanently exceed the 1.5 C level specified in the Paris Agreement which refers to long-term warming over many years. However, WMO is sounding the alarm that we will breach the 1.5 C level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency,\" WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement.\"We haven't been able to limit the warming so far and we are still moving in the wrong, wrong direction,\" Taalas said at a Wednesday press conference.Hermanson cautioned that \"a single year doesn't really mean anything.\" Scientists usually use 30-year averages.Those 66% odds of a single year hitting that threshold in five years have increased from 48% last year, 40% the year before, 20% in 2020 and 10% about a decade ago. The WMO report is based on calculations by 11 different climate science centers across the globe.      The world has been inching closer to the 1.5-degree threshold due to human-caused climate change for years. The temporary warming of this year's expected El Nino\u2014which starts with a warming of parts of the central Pacific Ocean and then sloshes across the globe\u2014makes it \"possible for us to see a single year exceeding 1.5 C a full decade before the long-term average,\" said climate scientist Zeke Hausfather of the tech company Stripe and Berkeley Earth, who wasn't part of the WMO report.                Extinction Rebellion activists and sympathizers shouted slogans against global warming when blocking a busy road in The Hague, Netherlands, Jan. 28, 2023. There\u2019s a two-out-of-three chance within the next five years that the world will temporarily reach the internationally accepted global temperature threshold for limiting the worst effects of climate change, a new World Meteorological Organization report forecasts on Wednesday, May 17, 2023. Credit: AP Photo/Peter Dejong, File             \"We don't expect the longer-term average to pass 1.5 C until the early-to-mid 2030s,\" Hausfather said in an email.But each year at or near 1.5 matters.\"We see this report as more of a barometer of how we're getting close, because the closer you get to the threshold, the more noise bumping up and down is going to bump you over the threshold randomly,\" Hermanson said in an interview. And he said the more random bumps over the mark occur, the closer the world actually gets to the threshold.Key in all this is the El Nino cycle. The world is coming off a record-tying triple dip La Nina\u2014three straight years of El Nino's cooler cousin restraining the human-caused warming climb\u2014and is on the verge of an El Nino that some scientists predict will be strong.The La Nina somewhat flattened the trend of human-caused warming so that the world hasn't broken the annual temperature mark since 2016, during the last El Nino, a super-sized one, Hermanson said.And that means a 98% chance of breaking the 2016 annual global temperature record between now and 2027, the report said. There's also a 98% chance that the next five years will be the hottest five years on record, the report said.Because of the shift from La Nina to El Nino \"where there were floods before, there will be droughts and where there were droughts before there might be floods,\" Hermanson said.The report warned that the Amazon will be abnormally dry for a good part of the next five years while the Sahel part of Africa\u2014the transition zone between the Sahara on the north and the savannas to the south\u2014will be wetter.That's \"one of the positive things coming out of this forecast,\" Hermanson said. \"It's not all doom-and-gloom and heat waves.\"University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann said reports like this put too much emphasis on global surface temperature, which varies with the El Nino cycle, even though it is climbing upward in the long term.The real concern is the deep water of oceans, which absorb an overwhelming majority of the world's human-caused warming, leading to a steady rise in ocean heat content and new records set regularly.\"I think it's important to realize that if we pass 1.5 degrees it's not a reason to give up,\" Hermanson said at a Wednesday news conference. \"We have to continue working out how much we can reduce emissions of greenhouse gases as much as possible, even after that, because it will make a difference.\"    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

Downpours that pounded the region's flatlands over two days caused nearly two dozen rivers to burst their banks, putting vast stretches of territory under water and causing thousands of residents to be evacuated.\"We watched from the (second-floor) window as the water gradually rose,\" Cesena resident Davide Maeldolla told AFP, pausing from mucking out his inundated home, where the water had risen as high as 1.5 metres (five feet).\"The helicopters circled all night to rescue people.\"In nearby Forli, southeast of the regional capital Bologna, Mayor Gian Luca Zattini said his city was \"on its knees, devastated and in pain.\"\"It's the end of the world,\" Zattini said.Regional authorities confirmed nine dead, with most in the area around Forli and Cesena.Flooding occurred in 41 municipalities, while an even greater number reported landslides.Thousands of farms in the fertile agricultural area were affected, but Agriculture Minister Francesco Lollobrigida said the water would have to subside before the government could quantify the damage.Two of the bodies in Forli were recovered by divers on Wednesday morning, as part of a huge rescue effort involving emergency services, armed forces and over 1,000 volunteers.                One of Italy's richest regions, Emilia Romagna had already been hit by heavy rain two weeks ago.             Torrents and thick mudTelevision images showed emergency workers carrying residents across flooded streets or transported in inflatable boats, vast parking lots completely submerged in water, while torrents of water rushed through the UNESCO-recognised porticoes of Bologna.A video taken by Italy's coastguard showed rescuers in a helicopter pulling up two elderly people from the roof of a home where the water level had nearly covered the first-floor windows.Cars were submerged and in areas where the water had receded, the streets were filled with thick mud and debris.One of Italy's richest regions, Emilia Romagna had already been hit by heavy rain two weeks ago, causing floods that left two dead.This time, around 50 centimetres (20 inches) of rain fell within 36 hours in Forli, Cesena and Ravenna\u2014around half the normal annual rainfall, a situation \"with few precedents\", Civil Protection Minister Nello Musumeci said.Musumeci said 20 million euros ($22 million) in emergency funds would be unlocked for the area, on top of the 10 million awarded after the previous flooding.The flooding caused the cancellation of Sunday's Formula One Emilia Romagna Grand Prix scheduled in Imola, with organisers saying they could not guarantee the safety of fans, teams and staff.      State of shockRescue workers had scrambled through the night to save children, the elderly and the disabled from the rising waters.In Cesena, local man Cristian Salamandri, wearing high rubber boots, was covered in mud by the end of the day.

  "text": "Radiocesium (RCs) has long half-life, strong radioactive toxicity, and high bioavailability. The migration and transformation of RCs in the environment have aroused much attention.          The environmental behavior of RCs is mainly regulated by the combination of clay minerals and natural weathering processes in soil or sediment. But the interaction of Cs adsorption and micaceous minerals weathering may further enhance the difficulty of interpreting and predicting the environmental behavior of RCs.Based on real environmental scenarios, a research team led by Prof. Fan Qiaohui from the Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources (NIEER) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences systematically investigated interactions between weathering of micaceous minerals and adsorption of RCs to understand the fate of RCs in ecosystem. The study was published in Water Research on March 28.They designed a research strategy consisting of three reaction sequences between the weathering of micaceous minerals and Cs+ adsorption, and analyzed changes in the micaceous mineral structure and Cs+ adsorption species on minerals to reveal the interaction mechanisms between the structural stability of micaceous minerals and the adsorption behavior of Cs+.Results showed that the sequence of reactions between the weathering of micaceous minerals and Cs+ adsorption significantly affected the adsorption species of Cs+ and the structural stability of micaceous minerals.Weathering could expand the interlayer structure of micaceous minerals, generating more strong affinity sites and decreasing the exchangeability and mobility of Cs+ in the interlayer of micaceous minerals. Besides, the Cs diffused into the interlayers would collapse the interlayers, impeding the ion exchange and improving the weathering resistance of micaceous minerals.High temperature and cations with large hydration radii (such as Ca2+) in the environment would accelerate the ion-exchange reaction between interlayers, which is conducive to the adsorption and fixation of Cs+ in micaceous mineral interlayers.\"The above findings suggest that the decontamination work for soil RCs should be carried out as soon as the RCs enter the soil environment,\" said Prof. Fan. \"Otherwise, with the prolongation of weathering time, RCs will stabilize in the soil and enhance the difficulty and cost of subsequent decontamination.\" More information:Wei Wang et al, Interactions between micaceous minerals weathering and cesium adsorption, Water Research (2023).

  "text": "To study ocean currents, scientists release GPS-tagged buoys in the ocean and record their velocities to reconstruct the currents that transport them. These buoy data are also used to identify \"divergences,\" which are areas where water rises up from below the surface or sinks beneath it.          By accurately predicting currents and pinpointing divergences, scientists can more precisely forecast the weather, approximate how oil will spread after a spill, or measure energy transfer in the ocean. A new model that incorporates machine learning makes more accurate predictions than conventional models do, a new study reports.A multidisciplinary research team including computer scientists at MIT and oceanographers has found that a standard statistical model typically used on buoy data can struggle to accurately reconstruct currents or identify divergences because it makes unrealistic assumptions about the behavior of water.The researchers developed a new model that incorporates knowledge from fluid dynamics to better reflect the physics at work in ocean currents. They show that their method, which only requires a small amount of additional computational expense, is more accurate at predicting currents and identifying divergences than the traditional model.This new model could help oceanographers make more accurate estimates from buoy data, which would enable them to more effectively monitor the transportation of biomass (such as Sargassum seaweed), carbon, plastics, oil, and nutrients in the ocean. This information is also important for understanding and tracking climate change.\"Our method captures the physical assumptions more appropriately and more accurately. In this case, we know a lot of the physics already. We are giving the model a little bit of that information so it can focus on learning the things that are important to us, like what are the currents away from the buoys, or what is this divergence and where is it happening?\" says senior author Tamara Broderick, an associate professor in MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and a member of the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society.Broderick's co-authors include lead author Renato Berlinghieri, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student; Brian L. Trippe, a postdoc at Columbia University; David R. Burt and Ryan Giordano, MIT postdocs; Kaushik Srinivasan, an assistant researcher in atmospheric and ocean sciences at the University of California at Los Angeles; Tamay \u00d6zg\u00f6kmen, professor in the Department of Ocean Sciences at the University of Miami; and Junfei Xia, a graduate student at the University of Miami. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning and is available as a pre-print on the arXiv server.      Diving into the dataOceanographers use data on buoy velocity to predict ocean currents and identify \"divergences\" where water rises to the surface or sinks deeper.To estimate currents and find divergences, oceanographers have used a machine-learning technique known as a Gaussian process, which can make predictions even when data are sparse. To work well in this case, the Gaussian process must make assumptions about the data to generate a prediction.A standard way of applying a Gaussian process to oceans data assumes the latitude and longitude components of the current are unrelated. But this assumption isn't physically accurate. For instance, this existing model implies that a current's divergence and its vorticity (a whirling motion of fluid) operate on the same magnitude and length scales. Ocean scientists know this is not true, Broderick says. The previous model also assumes the frame of reference matters, which means fluid would behave differently in the latitude versus the longitude direction.\"We were thinking we could address these problems with a model that incorporates the physics,\" she says.They built a new model that uses what is known as a Helmholtz decomposition to accurately represent the principles of fluid dynamics. This method models an ocean current by breaking it down into a vorticity component (which captures the whirling motion) and a divergence component (which captures water rising or sinking).In this way, they give the model some basic physics knowledge that it uses to make more accurate predictions.This new model utilizes the same data as the old model. And while their method can be more computationally intensive, the researchers show that the additional cost is relatively small.Buoyant performanceThey evaluated the new model using synthetic and real ocean buoy data. Because the synthetic data were fabricated by the researchers, they could compare the model's predictions to ground-truth currents and divergences. But simulation involves assumptions that may not reflect real life, so the researchers also tested their model using data captured by real buoys released in the Gulf of Mexico.In each case, their method demonstrated superior performance for both tasks, predicting currents and identifying divergences, when compared to the standard Gaussian process and another machine-learning approach that used a neural network. For example, in one simulation that included a vortex adjacent to an ocean current, the new method correctly predicted no divergence while the previous Gaussian process method and the neural network method both predicted a divergence with very high confidence.The technique is also good at identifying vortices from a small set of buoys, Broderick adds.Now that they have demonstrated the effectiveness of using a Helmholtz decomposition, the researchers want to incorporate a time element into their model, since currents can vary over time as well as space. In addition, they want to better capture how noise impacts the data, such as winds that sometimes affect buoy velocity. Separating that noise from the data could make their approach more accurate.\"Our hope is to take this noisily observed field of velocities from the buoys, and then say what is the actual divergence and actual vorticity, and predict away from those buoys, and we think that our new technique will be helpful for this,\" she says.\"The authors cleverly integrate known behaviors from fluid dynamics to model ocean currents in a flexible model,\" says Massimiliano Russo, an associate biostatistician at Brigham and Women's Hospital and instructor at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved with this work. \"The resulting approach retains the flexibility to model the nonlinearity in the currents but can also characterize phenomena such as vortices and connected currents that would only be noticed if the fluid dynamic structure is integrated into the model. This is an excellent example of where a flexible model can be substantially improved with a well thought and scientifically sound specification.\" More information:Renato Berlinghieri et al, Gaussian processes at the Helm(holtz): A more fluid model for ocean currents, arXiv (2023).

In 2017, a wildfire got dangerously close to her neighborhood in Sonoma County. Then, two years later, while she was on a visit to Duluth on the advice of a colleague, another fire forced her parents to evacuate their home.That \"was the straw that broke the camel's back,\" Welch, 40, told AFP.Duluth, in the far northern reaches of the United States, is known for bitterly cold and snowy winters, fueled by powerful winds blowing off Lake Superior.But despite its tough environment, this Midwestern city of 86,000 is starting to make a name for itself as a refuge of sorts\u2014for those fleeing the effects of climate change.Wildfires, which scientists say have been made more frequent and powerful by climate change, also persuaded John Jenkins to ditch California's beaches for Duluth's icy shores.\"The air smells cleaner. The water is some of the best water in the world. It's just very clean, it's pristine, it's beautiful,\" 38-year-old Jenkins said, speaking to AFP from the restaurant he bought and renovated.Even on winter days that drop below -20 degrees Fahrenheit (-29 degrees Celsius) Welch and Jenkins don't regret their decisions.                Duluth, an old industrial city with a population of 86,000, is being talked about as a potential future 'climate refuge'             And Jenkins' family has only grown. Since moving here with his wife, he has had two kids, and several family members have come to join them.Around the world, climate change has already displaced thousands involuntarily.

Christina Welch moved from her native California to chilly Minnesota after mutliple wildfires threatened her family's homes.

We're not ready to kind of help the passenger next to us, and yet, climate is calling us to do that. And so it's a lot.\"In addition, Larson said, it would feel \"predatory\" to run a \"marketing strategy\" based on climate shocks in California or elsewhere by saying \"I'm really sorry... but you can come here because it's cooler by the lake.\"Keenan argues this is the wrong way to look at things.\"People are going to come one way or the other, no matter what you do,\" he said.Larson's office declined to speak to AFP.The challenge facing Duluth \"is quite a simple one,\" Keenan said.Either the city can \"promote sustainable urban development,\" with the investments in housing and transport that requires, or growth\u2014wanted or not\u2014will come in the traditional way, with car-dependent sprawl and poorer residents being priced out in a form of \"climate gentrification.\"                Restaurant owner John Jenkins, a native of California who moved to Minnesota, says Duluth is 'just very clean, it's pristine, it's beautiful'             Duluth is a place for \"climate optimists,\" people who \"believe that we can do this, that we can decarbonize the world.\"But even he has his worries.\"It's a beautiful part of the country.

The previously unknown region of earthquake uplift, in Rarangi, Marlborough, was discovered using a combination of new data from laser mapping and kelp genetics.Co-author Professor Jon Waters, of the Department of Zoology, says the study gives new insights into the changes in Aotearoa's landscapes and the recent history of earthquake impacts.\"In a geologically well studied country like New Zealand, there is still a lot to learn about our history of earthquakes and changing landforms,\" he says.The paper, just published in Journal of the Royal Society Interface, utilised LiDAR mapping (remote sensing technology used to model ground elevation) and genetic analysis of bull kelp from the uplifted section of coast.The team identified a previously unrecognised area of uplifted rocky coastline\u2014a bench about 1m above sea level\u2014and a genetic anomaly in kelp below that bench. The kelp's genetics indicate the species went extinct in the area following an earthquake, before being recolonised by kelp which drifted from 300km south.The group believe the earthquake responsible occurred about 2000 to 3000 years ago, showing the potential for kelp to record geological disturbance events.\"The area is close to a well-known active fault and several big, past earthquakes have been well quantified by other researchers, but this coastal uplift zone was not previously known\u2014the evidence for it is extremely clear now we've had a chance to look more closely.\"Rarangi is also a very popular summer swimming spot, rather than some obscure or remote location, and the evidence of coastal uplift was hiding in plain sight,\" Professor Waters says.The research is the latest output from the group's Marsden-funded project assessing earthquake impacts on coastal species.\"Our work uses a combination of genetics and geology, and it's quite exciting that these combined approaches have allowed us to pinpoint a previously unknown site of coastal uplift in New Zealand.\"This work serves to highlight again just how dynamic our country is\u2014and how earthquake uplift leaves long lasting signatures in our coastal species.\" More information:Integrating kelp genomic analyses and geological data to reveal ancient earthquake impacts, Journal of the Royal Society Interface (2023).

In the first case study of its kind in Canada, researchers looked at Peterborough's new Quaker Foods City Square park, which cost taxpayers $6.4 million, and have estimated the economic value of physical and mental health benefits that could come from it at more than $4 million per year. The framework considers the health savings associated with improved mental health and better air quality, the avoided economic burden of physical inactivity and higher life satisfaction.The study demonstrates the value of developing and enhancing urban parks as a strategy to improve population health and well-being, and as a means of cost savings to the medical system.\"Investments in urban parks are among the soundest financial decisions a community can make,\" said Jeffrey Wilson, professor in the School of Environment, Enterprise and Development. \"When you consider the population health benefits, the value of lessening climate-related impacts and the role of parks to support economic development, we see how parks provide a large payback.\"The park was developed on land previously used as a parking lot to revitalize the downtown core of Peterborough. The study's estimated benefits of this new space represent only a portion of the park's value, as the researchers considered only a few benefits attributed to park use and vegetation cover.Future research could calculate other benefits such as respite from hot temperatures, relief from noise pollution, increased biodiversity and social benefits resulting from stronger feelings of community cohesion, higher levels of community engagement, and reduced isolation. The researchers also identified other factors, such as socio-demographic, cultural variables, and urban design features, that could be included to increase the rigour of the results and further quantify the return on urban park investments.\"Dollars drive decisions,\" said Wilson. \"It can be challenging for decision-makers to support the development and expansion of urban parks because there are competing land use pressures, and municipalities are responsible for park operation and maintenance costs.

  "text": "Plastic pollution could reduce by 80% by 2040 if countries and companies make deep policy and market shifts using existing technologies, according to a new report by UN Environment Program (UNEP). The report is released ahead of a second round of negotiations in Paris on a global agreement to beat plastic pollution, and outlines the magnitude and nature of the changes required to end plastic pollution and create a circular economy.          Turning off the Tap: How the world can end plastic pollution and create a circular economy is a solutions-focused analysis of concrete practices, market shifts, and policies that can inform government thinking and business action.\"The way we produce, use and dispose of plastics is polluting ecosystems, creating risks for human health and destabilizing the climate,\" said Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director. \"This UNEP report lays out a roadmap to dramatically reduces these risks through adopting a circular approach that keeps plastics out of ecosystems, out of our bodies and in the economy. If we follow this roadmap, including in negotiations on the plastic pollution deal, we can deliver major economic, social and environmental wins.\"Market shifts needed for the market transformation toward circularityTo slash plastic pollution by 80% globally by 2040, the report suggests first eliminating problematic and unnecessary plastics to reduce the size of the problem. Subsequently, the report calls for three market shifts\u2014reuse, recycle and reorient and diversify products:Reuse: Promoting reuse options, including refillable bottles, bulk dispensers, deposit-return-schemes, packaging take-back schemes etc., can reduce 30% of plastic pollution by 2040. To realize its potential, governments must help build a stronger business case for reusables.Recycle: Reducing plastic pollution by an additional 20% by 2040 can be achieved if recycling becomes a more stable and profitable venture. Removing fossil fuels subsidies, enforcing design guidelines to enhance recyclability, and other measures would increase the share of economically recyclable plastics from 21% to 50%.Reorient and diversify: Careful replacement of products such as plastic wrappers, sachets and takeaway items with products made from alternative materials (such as paper or compostable materials) can deliver an additional 17% decrease in plastic pollution.Even with the measures above, 100 million metric tons of plastics from single-use and short-lived products will still need to be safely dealt with annually by 2040\u2014together with a significant legacy of existing plastic pollution. This can be addressed by setting and implementing design and safety standards for disposing of non-recyclable plastic waste, and by making manufacturers responsible for products shedding microplastics, among others.Overall, the shift to a circular economy would result in USD 1.27 trillion in savings, considering costs and recycling revenues. A further USD 3.25 trillion would be saved from avoided externalities such as health, climate, air pollution, marine ecosystem degradation, and litigation-related costs. This shift could also result in a net increase of 700,000 jobs by 2040, mostly in low-income countries, significantly improving the livelihoods of millions of workers in informal settings.Investment costs for the recommended systemic change are significant, but below the spending without this systemic change: USD 65 billion per year as opposed to USD 113 billion per year. Much of this can be mobilized by shifting planned investments for new production facilities\u2014no longer needed through reduction in material needs\u2014or a levy on virgin plastic production into the necessary circular infrastructure. Yet time is of the essence: a five-year delay may lead to an increase of 80 million metric tons of plastic pollution by 2040.The highest costs in both a throwaway and circular economy are operational. With regulation to ensure plastics are designed to be circular, Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes can cover these operational costs of ensuring the system's circularity through requiring producers to finance the collection, recycling and responsible end-of-life disposal of plastic products.Internationally agreed policies can help overcome the limits of national planning and business action, sustain a flourishing circular global plastics economy, unlock business opportunities and create jobs. These may include agreed criteria for plastic products that could be banned, a cross-border knowledge baseline, rules on necessary minimum operating standards of EPR schemes and other standards.The report recommends that a global fiscal framework could be part of international policies to enable recycled materials to compete on a level playing field with virgin materials, create an economy of scale for solutions, and establish monitoring systems and financing mechanisms.Crucially, policymakers are encouraged to embrace an approach that integrates regulatory instruments and policies tackling actions across the life cycle, as these are mutually reinforcing towards the goal of transforming the economy. For example, design rules to make products economically recyclable can be combined with targets to incorporate recycled content and fiscal incentives for recycling plants.The report also addresses specific policies, including standards for design, safety, and compostable and biodegradable plastics; targets for minimum recycling; EPR schemes; taxes; bans; communication strategies; public procurement, and labeling.

  "question_squad": " What is Nigeria's informal sector?",
  "answer_squad": " 57.7%",
  "text": "Street food is popular in Nigerian cities. Most of the local food delicacies are sold by vendors whose livelihoods depend on informal subsistence activities such as local food production and street food hawking. They are part of Nigeria's vast informal sector, which accounts for 57.7% of the country's economy.          But most food prepared by vendors has to be consumed within a short time to avoid spoilage. Refrigeration capacity is limited because of unreliable power supplies in the country.The popularity of food sold by street vendors is part of a global shift in urban areas to \"fast foods\". Most of the fast food in Nigerian cities is packaged in plastic bags. These are bad for the environment.Leaves could be an alternative for packaging. But their use in cities has not been fully explored\u2014so we studied the possibility and sustainability of using natural leaves as packaging material for traditional foods in Nigeria. Leaves are still used in the Nigerian countryside to package food.We analyzed academic literature as well as policy briefs and project documents from governmental and nongovernmental organizations. We found that leaf-type packaging material had several environmental advantages:They are organic so they contain no artificial chemicals that can pollute the environment.Their waste is easy to handle as they degrade fast.Making them does not involve the use of energy, like burning of fossil fuels that could pollute the environment, unlike the production of synthetic packaging materials.In the second part of our work we proposed a model that would help ensure the environmental sustainability of local food packaging materials. This model is based on the principle that good food packaging should protect food, be appealing, and preserve taste and nutrition. And there has to be a commitment to public health and environmental safety.Considering that local food has been packaged in leaves since long ago in Nigeria, we concluded that there's a strong case for reviving the use of natural leaf type packaging in the country's cities.Based on our research, we recommend that strong institutions and policies be put in place to oversee the local food industry. We believe that our work is critical in informing food, health and environmental policy decisions in Nigeria and other developing regions.      Alternative packagingOur research involved looking at three phases of the leaf-type material used for food packaging in Nigeria. The first stage is when the leaf is sourced as the raw material for packaging; the second when it is used for packaging; and the final stage is when it is disposed of as garbage after use.In rural areas, sources of green leaves for food packaging are backyard farms, nearby forests and bushes. People cultivate the source plant species close to their homes for convenience in daily use. These packaging materials are processed entirely naturally or organically.But these materials are not abundantly available in urban areas. People living in towns and cities use discarded cans, old newspapers, foil, cellophane and polythene bags as substitutes.There are special traditional types of Nigerian delicacies that are prepared, served and packaged using vegetable leaf wrappers. They include ogiri (spices), ukpaka (bean seed), akara (bean cake), agidi (corn cake) and fufu (cassava).Green leaf packages prevent nutrients from being lost through evaporation or transpiration. They are easy to handle, making food distribution and transportation simple. And they protect food products from deterioration.Environmentally, using vegetable leaves instead of synthetic packaging on a bigger industrial scale might cut down on carbon emissions. Used leaves also degrade quickly.A model for useOur circular economy concept has been developed as a possible way to achieve sustainability objectives. It seeks to ensure availability of local packaging materials in urban areas.The proposed model would integrate stakeholders and activities in the value chain. It covers effective urban planning, proper waste resource management and wealth creation while considering social, political and economic realities typical to the developing world. The model explains the roles that all stakeholders, policies and institutions will play to make leaves abundantly available in cities while ensuring environmental sustainability.For instance, while urban planning is concerned with tree-planting for aesthetics, using our model, the choice of trees could be those species that provide multiple functions.The outcome shows that the green leaf packaging material for indigenous food items in Nigeria could work in terms of market viability and social acceptability.What stands in the wayThere is an urgent need for new regulations and better control of local food production, packaging and consumption in Nigeria. Two major factors inform this:Many of Nigeria's food processing facilities are still home-based or in cottage industries using rudimentary tools and procedures.There is minimal consideration for good manufacturing practices and hygienic production processes. This leads to frequent chemical and microbial contamination.We identified some solutions.Food packaging requires investment in technology and innovation. This investment is missing in Nigeria.We also believe that if the government creates adequate channels, nongovernmental and private organizations could salvage the situation. There have been cases where developmental organizations bypassed government institutions and worked directly with private sector organizations and nongovernmental organizations involved with vendors or street food marketers and others at the micro-economy level.This support could be in the form of basic health, hygiene and safety education and providing them with equipment like gloves and disinfectants.

  "text": "Flying thousands of feet above the Sierra Nevada in a plane equipped with specialized imaging devices, Elizabeth Carey has been scanning the mountains with lasers to precisely map the snow.          The snow blanketing the Sierra lies so deep that the mountain range looks surprisingly swollen and \"puffy,\" said Carey, who leads the flights.\"The amount of water that we have in the snowpack this year is just mind-blowing,\" she said. \"It's just been extraordinary.\"By mapping the snowpack with laser pulses and spectrometers, Carey and her colleagues are able to provide a detailed picture of one of the biggest snow accumulations ever recorded in the state. The flights are also collecting data to estimate when and how fast the snow will melt, helping California officials prepare for the runoff, manage water releases from dams, and assess which areas are most at risk of flooding.Their measurements, along with estimates by other researchers, show that when the snowpack reached its peak in April, it held approximately 40 million acre-feet of water, nearly as much as the total capacity of all the state's reservoirs combined. Although some of that snow has started to thaw at lower elevations, much of it remains in the mountains\u2014setting the stage for melting on a vast scale, as well as enormous river flows that could inundate some low-lying communities.To help prepare for the onslaught of snowmelt, state water managers and emergency officials are relying on the extensive aerial surveys provided by Carey's employer, Airborne Snow Observatories Inc.While collecting data from 23,000 feet, the flight teams have had a rare vantage point to witness the dramatic transformation of the mountains below. In some areas, they have measured snowdrifts that are 80 feet deep or more. Cliffs that once jutted from mountainsides have been buried, disappearing into white slopes.\"It looks like an Arctic landscape,\" said Thomas Painter, a snow scientist and chief executive officer of Airborne Snow Observatories. \"Each time we fly right now, we're measuring history.\"Across the Sierra Nevada, this year's snowpack peaked at about 2.7 times the average, weighing an estimated 55 billion tons, according to Painter.      As of this week, the snowpack stands at more than 300% of average for this time of year, and the southern Sierra is buried in snow that measures more than four times the average for mid-May.\"This is going to be the benchmark against which subsequent years are measured,\" Painter said.The aerial surveys have enabled scientists to obtain much more detailed snow estimates than in the past. Previously, they relied largely on automated snow sensors as well as manual surveys in which specialists trek into the mountains and sink metal tubes into the snow to measure the water content.The company uses three planes to survey snow watershed by watershed, from the Yuba River basin to the Kings River basin. The flight crews bring back hard drives loaded with data, which feed into computer models that generate detailed forecasts of runoff and streamflow.The new methods, Painter said, are like \"all of a sudden going from radio to high-resolution television.\"The aerial surveys provide a three-dimensional picture of each watershed that is similar to a CT scan, helping to guide decisions about releasing water from dams under high-flow conditions, said Wes Monier, chief hydrologist of the Turlock Irrigation District. The district manages releases from Don Pedro Reservoir, which is now 73% full.\"This is a game-changer in understanding how to make these flood releases,\" Monier said. \"We've never had this intelligence before.\"The company provides data to the state Department of Water Resources, which uses the information to complement measurements from its network of 130 snow sensors across the Sierra Nevada.The data is also used by other agencies. When avalanches buried Highway 395 and toppled power lines near Mono Lake, the team flew over the area and mapped the snow, turning over the data to Caltrans and Southern California Edison.Carey, a former NASA astrophysicist, squatted under a plane's belly at Mammoth Yosemite Airport recently and pointed out a cylinder packed with gadgets and lenses, including two high-resolution cameras, two spectrometers and the dual-laser scanning lidar system.In each watershed, the crew will fly in a series of lines back and forth.\"We just mow the lawn over the Sierra Nevada, and shoot laser pulses out of the bottom of the plane,\" Carey said. \"We shoot about a half a million laser pulses a second.\"The lasers penetrate less than a centimeter into the snow, allowing the team to compare each measurement to snow-free readings of the landscape, revealing how deep the snowpack is.\"We go as fast as we can,\" Carey said. \"We can get so much information just from a short six-hour flight.\"One of the rented planes, a King Air 90, isn't pressurized like a regular passenger plane, requiring the crew to use oxygen masks to breathe in the thin air.They usually finish their survey flights in June. But with so much snow this year, they plan to keep flying into August.The spectrometers that gaze downward from the aircraft capture images in hundreds of wavelengths, from the visible spectrum to shortwave infrared. This measures the albedo, or reflectivity, of the snow\u2014a key factor in how quickly it will melt.When snow lies on the ground for weeks or months, the grains of snow grow larger, absorbing more sunlight and accelerating melting. If dust has blown onto snow, the darker surface will also lead to faster melting. But this year, the storms repeatedly laid down fresh powder, leaving a highly reflective snowpack.The first week of May, a rare late-season storm brought another coating of fresh snow. Painter said the snow's high reflectivity slowed the initial melting.Well into the spring, he said, the snowpack remained \"very clean, very bright,\" reflecting the sunlight and largely staying frozen.In recent days, however, he said the snowpack has been darkening at low elevations. Temperatures have been rising, and the melting has been accelerating.In the southern San Joaquin Valley, runoff has been refilling the long-dry Tulare Lake, inundating tens of thousands of acres of farm lands. The snowmelt also threatens low-lying towns nearby.Some who manage California's reservoirs have been comparing this year's snowmelt to \"a runaway train that you can see and predict quite well, but you just can't stop,\" said Noah Molotch, a research scientist at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory who estimates the snow water equivalent across the Sierra. \"They have a pretty good handle on the amount of water that's going to be coming into their systems. They just don't have anywhere to put the water.\"The pace of melting will depend on temperatures in the coming weeks. If the snowmelt runoff comes at a moderate pace, it will be more manageable, Molotch said.Based on current trends, some Sierra watersheds will hit peak flow in mid- to late May, while others will peak in June, Molotch said.He and other experts caution that even as the big snowpack has brought a measure of relief for California's water supplies after three extremely dry years, the state's long-term water challenges remain and will grow more acute as the climate continues to warm.The extreme shift from the record drought to this historic snow year demonstrates the \"climate whiplash\" phenomenon that the state needs to prepare for, said Mark Gold, director of water scarcity solutions for the Natural Resources Defense Council.\"It should make it clear to everyone that how we're managing water resources in California needs to change,\" Gold said. \"We have to plan for the extremes in climate more appropriately, and that's not something that we're doing adequately as a state.\"Gold said that includes planning projects to capture much more water during extremely high flows to replenish depleted groundwater in the San Joaquin Valley. He said preparing for extremes also requires using the best available science, including remote sensing by planes and satellites.Painter said the aerial snow surveys have become a \"part of the state water infrastructure\" and are vital for improving water management as climate change unleashes more intense swings between dry spells and extremely wet conditions.Painter started the program in 2013 when he was working at JPL in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge. Using a single plane, he and his team took measurements of the smallest snowpack on record in 2015, and then surveyed deep snow in 2017, when runoff filled the state's reservoirs.Painter left NASA in 2019, carrying on the work through a spinoff by transferring the technology to Airborne Snow Observatories, a new public benefit corporation. The company now has 22 employees.Painter's team has made 42 flights over the Sierra Nevada so far this year. It has also been flying over the Colorado River Basin and other parts of the West to collect data.In the Sierra Nevada, state officials continue operating the network of automated snow sensors and doing manual surveys in about 250 locations. Those measurements on the ground add to the aerial survey data.\"It gives us for the first time, really ever, a true watershed-scale accounting,\" said David Rizzardo, manager of the Department of Water Resources' hydrology section. \"And it does it extremely accurately.\"The flights have been surveying 12 of the 18 mountain basins monitored by the state, typically flying three or four times annually in each watershed. Rizzardo said the state's goal is to expand the program to all 18 watersheds and fly six to eight times per year in each.On a personal level, Painter said he feels happy seeing all the snow. Next to his house in Mammoth, the snow has been up to 20 feet deep. He is looking forward to skiing all summer long.In his years studying snow in the Sierra Nevada, Painter has seen glaciers retreat with the rise in temperatures. This rare heavy snowpack will make for a year of glacier-building, but he expects the expansion won't last long.\"We know that with climate change, we're not going to be seeing a lot more big, snowy years. A lot of these are going to change into rain, more and more rain,\" Painter said.\"And so there's something very sentimental about it,\" he said. \"I think we're really, really lucky to live through a year like this.\"    \u00a92023 Los Angeles Times.

  "text": "A new report from Bayes Business School (formerly Cass) shows how flood risk affects English residential property values to raise awareness among policy makers and regulators.          Data from the report, authored by Dr. Alexandros Skouralis, lead researcher and Dr. Nicole Lux, Senior Research Fellow at Bayes, shows that residential properties at risk of flooding are sold at 8.14% lower on average compared to non-affected properties, which reaches as high as 32.2% for the highest risk properties.Using a unique property price dataset provided by Rightmove, the UK's number one property website, the report analyzes the 4.8 million listings and 3.2 million completed transactions that took place between 2006 and 2022.For all properties, a property-level flood score was provided by Twinn by Royal HaskoningDHV that considers risk from fluvial, pluvial and tidal sources. It uses advanced flood-modeling techniques and incorporates the most current hydrology data from the Centre of Ecology & Hydrology. The model is also used by the major insurance companies.Key findings from the report include:Properties at highest risk of flooding are based in East of England, Yorkshire and the Humber and the North West, which typically have flood risk probability of between 10% and 12%.Semi-detached and terraced properties (9% flood risk probability) are more vulnerable to flooding since prevention measures\u2014such as improved windows, doors, vents and pipes will only be effective in conjunction with neighbors versus detached houses with only a 7% flood risk probability.Overall flood risk is expected to increase for 73% of affected properties by 2080, while the probability of flooding is set to increase by a further 8%. A low-risk property, with a probability of flooding below 20%, that is affected by a flood event is expected to be sold at a lower price of between 9.6% and 13.6%.The value of lower priced properties is likely to be more affected by flood risk when compared to higher priced properties.The report shines a light on the extent to which climate change and the increased propensity of natural disasters is affecting the housing market.Ed Burgess, Strategic Manager in Data Services at Rightmove, commented, \"We've been at the forefront of data innovations in the environmental space, using our unique position as the UK's number one property website to help businesses and organizations to better understand how climate factors could affect the property market, both now and in the future.\"\"Although flood risk is largely factored into a valuation at the property marketing stage, the analysis shows how it will play a more significant role in property valuations by 2050, and is likely to rise up the list of home-mover concerns.\"Dr. Nicole Lux, Senior Research Fellow at Bayes Business School, said the findings should be a wake-up call for risk protection programs.\"In this empirical study we quantify the impact that the risk of flooding has on property valuations,\" she said. \"With sea levels and unpredictability of climate set to rise in years to come, this poses a great threat to properties and the housing market\u2014particularly in low-income neighborhoods.\"\"Flood risk impact on low-income neighborhoods is something national programs from the Environmental Agency's flood risk management plans (FRMPs) should take into account.\"\"In any case, market participants such as property buyers, insurance companies etc have already accounted for the flood risk in all their underwriting and pricing.\" More information:Report: cdn.roxhillmedia.com/productio \u2026 5fe173d8fc61c850.pdfProvided byCity University LondonCitation:One in six properties in England will be affected by flood risk by 2050, study suggests (2023, May 16)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-properties-england-affected.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "The Superior National Forest and three northeastern Minnesota Chippewa tribes have made a first-of-its-kind agreement, one that gives the tribes a stronger voice in managing national forest and federal trust land that was ceded to the federal government nearly 170 years ago.          The Fond du Lac and Grand Portage bands of Lake Superior Chippewa and the Bois Forte Band of Chippewa signed an agreement with the U.S. Forest Service recently to protect the bands' treaty rights within the Superior National Forest.Bois Forte Chair Cathy Chavers called the agreement \"historic,\" with three bands within the 1854 Treaty boundaries coming together as one to protect natural resources. Area Chippewa ceded land to the United States in 1854 in exchange for hunting, fishing and gathering rights in northeastern Minnesota.\"These bands have been on this landscape from time immemorial, connected to the work of how we sustain these lands,\" said Tom Hall, supervisor of the Superior National Forest. \"This is really us standing shoulder to shoulder with the bands, knowing we're going to face issues and making sure we're having the right conversations early and together.\"More than 3 million acres of 1854 Ceded Territory\u2014about half\u2014fall inside the national forest.The agreement recognizes the sovereign bands as original stewards of that land and outlines ways to ensure tribal input is included early in decisions made by the Forest Service, including those that impact treaty rights. It stipulates training from both sides, coordination with the bands on management priorities, and provisions for protection of culturally sensitive areas within the forest.\"It's been 169 years since the signing of the 1854 Treaty. (The treaty) says shared resources\u2014that is true today,\" Fond du Lac Band Chair Kevin Dupuis Sr. said in a news release. \"Our tribal leadership has an obligation to the ones who came before us, and we are here today to make sure that our unborn can exercise our inherent rights given to use by the Creator.\"The Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe and the Chippewa National Forest have a similar agreement.While the tribes and the Forest Service have long worked together, the agreement lays out a plan for making meaningful change in how that happens, for things like prescribed burns or restoration activities for hunting, fishing and gathering, Hall said.Tribal forest management differs from federal management, said April McCormick, secretary and treasurer of the Grand Portage band.Tribes take a more holistic, all-encompassing approach to caring for the forest, rather than managing a single species, she said. They place importance on what's culturally significant about each species, and take care that treaty-reserved resources are protected for future generations.For example, to ensure maple trees are healthy so that tribal members can continue their sugarbush traditions\u2014harvesting maple sap for syrup-making\u2014\"there is a whole set of tribal cultural values that our foresters use to manage the landscape,\" McCormick said. \"Everything is interconnected. If (the Forest Service) could really understand and incorporate that into their decisionmaking, then we are empowering the Forest Service to make good decisions.\"The agreement\u2014a memorandum of understanding\u2014is part of a 2021 federal initiative to foster healthy communication and relationships with tribal governments, to better protect treaty rights as they relate to federal lands and waters, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior.    2023 StarTribune.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "answer_squad": " 40% more fossil fuel use than reusables",
  "text": "Around the world, another 45 babies are born every ten seconds. Each of these babies will require nappies that need to be changed frequently. So it's understandable that new parents want to do what's best for their baby\u2014and the planet\u2014when it comes to the all-important nappy change.          With the advent of disposable nappies, the experience of wrestling children into rubbery triangles of cloth while attempting to pin everything in place has become a thing of the past. These single-use nappies are more absorbent and are designed for quick and easy changing.Disposable nappies have transformed the lives of busy parents. But this popular option has its drawbacks. Disposable nappies are difficult to recycle. Many end up being dumped in the environment or sent to landfill. One study found that more than 300,000 disposable nappies are incinerated, sent to landfill or end up in the environment every minute.These nappies also contain several different plastics which take years to break down, and when they do they release harmful microplastics. The waste\u2014and chemicals\u2014inside the nappy itself can also end up leaching out into the environment and contaminating soil and water sources.However, there are potentially more sustainable alternatives. One is biodegradable nappies. But even these nappies have been met with criticism\u2014all biodegradable nappies contain some plastic materials (like sticky tabs made from polyurethane) so will take many years to break down.Increasing uptake of reusable nappies is another option. It would certainly generate less plastic waste, but whether reusable nappies are truly a better environmental choice is unclear.Environmental footprint of nappiesIn 2008, the Environment Agency carried out a study comparing the lifecycle environmental footprint of different nappy options in the UK. This study found little difference between the environmental impact of disposable and reusable nappies.This study has been recently updated. The new report analyzed the carbon footprint of reusable and disposable nappies in greater detail and considered how things have changed 15 years on.Both options are now more sustainable. We have more renewable energy in our energy mix, so the production, packaging and transportation of nappies is now more efficient. Disposable nappies are also lighter and more compact than they were before, so require less packaging and energy to transport.The environmental impact of both reusable and disposable nappies is, however, still relatively large. The carbon footprint of using disposable nappies for one child up to the age of two and a half is now the equivalent of 457 kg of CO\u2082 (although this is 27% less than in 2008). Reusable nappies (which this time considered more reusable nappy options than the original study) had 25% less global heating potential\u2014but their carbon footprint was still the equivalent of 345 kg of CO\u2082.Disposables performed worse on six environmental impact categories. This was mostly down to how the nappy was produced and disposed of.Due to the use of plastics, disposable nappies were associated with 40% more fossil fuel use than reusables. The environmental impact of single-use nappies was also much higher when it came to disposal. These nappies had a 26% higher impact on freshwater eutrophication (where water is overloaded with nutrients).So, does this mean that new parents should rush out and buy reusable nappies? Maybe, but with a note of caution. Reusable nappies were outperformed by disposables on 11 of the 18 environmental factors considered.This was associated mainly with the electricity and detergent used to wash and dry them. The latter caused 333% more marine pollution than the use of disposable nappies.      Reducing your footprintThe good news is that this impact is something that we can control. Parents can lower their impact by washing nappies at lower temperature settings or in more efficient machines, avoiding the tumble drier and extending their use by passing them on to other children.Another option is washing nappies together in full washing loads. But this would require having sufficient nappies available to allow storage of used nappies while also having a clean and dry supply for your baby.One way of making sure the laundry is done efficiently is to sign up to a local nappy laundry service if there is one nearby. These companies collect your dirty nappies and give you freshly-laundered ones in return.Whichever type of nappy we use, a final thing we could do is to toilet train our children earlier. The updated study revealed that, since 2008, parents have shifted to potty training their children at a later stage in their development. Around 37% of children aged two and a half, for example, are still wearing disposable nappies, while 35% were still in reusable nappies\u201419.4% and 17.4% more than in 2008 respectively. This means that we are producing, using and transporting more nappies, and using more water and energy to wash them.Reusable nappies can help to lower our carbon footprint. But only if we wash at lower temperatures, with efficient equipment and avoid tumble drying. In the UK, especially in winter, this last point could be an issue, so having a mixed approach would be a suitable compromise.Parents could continue to choose disposable nappies when line drying is difficult. There are also several steps we can take to lessen the environmental impact of disposable nappies are their use. Not dumping them in the environment is a good start\u2014but making sure they go to a waste-to-energy incinerator, or even better, there are now ways to recycle them and turn them into something new.

  "text": "The Brazilian rainforest is one of the world's few continental regions with clean air. However, this is only true during the wet season, when the concentration of particulate matter is very low. During the dry season, it's a different story: numerous deforestation fires burn within the Amazon rainforest, as an \"arc of deforestation\" eats into the rainforest from the south.          Soot and other emissions from the fires lead to a drastic reduction in air quality at this time of year. The air quality in the central Amazon at this time is no better than that in urban European conurbations. The concentration of soot particles in the atmosphere above the forest canopy fluctuates between very low and very high.For the first time, a research team has investigated the origins of the soot particles. They made a surprising discovery: a large number of the particles do not originate in South America; instead, they travel with air masses around 10,000 kilometers from Africa over the Atlantic, stemming from natural bush fires, slash and burn practices, and the combustion of biomass, such as for cooking.\"Smoke from Africa can be found virtually all year long in large amounts above the rainforest\u2014we had not expected this,\" explains Bruna Holanda, who led the study as a doctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry. \"We had estimated the amount of smoke from Africa would be around 5 or perhaps 15 percent. As it turns out, sometimes it reached as high as 60 percent.\"According to the atmospheric physicist, this value demonstrates the efficiency of the atmospheric transport of soot and aerosol particles via air masses from Africa to South America.Soot particles from Africa and South America are physically and chemically distinct from one anotherIn order to attribute the soot above the Amazon to various sources, the researchers analyzed soot particles in the air above the Amazon over a period of two years at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO). The research unit is situated in a virtually untouched region in the central Amazon and, among other facilities, boasts a 325-meter observation tower.The team identified two prevailing types of soot: soot particles from Africa were considerably larger than those from the Amazon region and exhibited a lower concentration of organic material. The researchers attribute this to the fact that in Africa, the regions being burned are primarily grassland, savannah and open forests. The dryer fuel is more likely to result in flaming combustion and more soot particles. Conversely, South American fires occur in dense and moist forests.This moister fuel leads to smoldering combustion, which results in soot with a larger concentration of organic material. Using meteorological data such as the main wind field and satellite imagery, in which the smoke clouds are even visible at times, Holanda and her colleagues then determined the respective source of the smoke.In this way, the researchers also ascertained that there are two periods a year when a particularly large amount of smoke travels from Africa to the Amazon: first, during the wet season from January to March, winds consistently bring soot combined with Sahara dust into the region. During this time, on average, 60 percent of the soot particles above the Amazon originate from African fires.The air is in fact particularly clean during the wet season, because there are hardly any slash and burn fires in the region. However, at times the smoke from Africa makes the air as dirty in this season as it is during the dry season. Second, during the dry season from August to November, lots of soot from Africa can be observed in the Central Amazon.In contrast with the wet season, during this time there are many natural and human-made fires in the region, particularly in dry areas of the Amazon basin. In other regions of the Amazon, regional fires account for around two thirds of the soot pollution. However, a third of the soot in these regions originates in Africa, thereby exacerbating the otherwise already grave air pollution levels.      Smoke impacts the climate and the water cycle Soot and other aerosol particles absorb and scatter sunlight, which affects the radiation or energy balance of the earth and our climate. Soot particles in particular are very active to radiation, since they absorb considerably more sunlight than they reflect, thus retaining heat in the earth system. Dust and soot particles also serve as condensation nuclei in the emergence of cloud drops. As such, they influence the formation of clouds and precipitation; in this way then, they also impact the water budget.\"Our results can help to improve climate and earth system models, which have hitherto insufficiently reflected African smoke components,\" explains Christopher P\u00f6hlker, group leader at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry. In his opinion, the efficiency of the transport also indicated that African smoke had already reached South America in pre-industrial times, since African vegetation that was susceptible to fire had presumably been burning for tens of thousands of years.\"We suspect that soot has long played an important role in soil fertilization and forest formation in the Amazon region, as well as in the carbon and water cycles,\" the atmospheric chemist continues. However, previously positive effects such as this may now become detrimental. \"The deforestation rate, the number of fires, and the resulting soot in the previous years are unprecedented and could have grave consequences for regional and global climate change,\" P\u00f6hlker says.The findings are published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.

Te Whare W\u0101nanga o Waitaha | University of Canterbury School of Mathematics and Statistics Lecturer Dr. Leighton Watson has for the first time shown that seismic signals\u2014ground shaking recorded by seismometers\u2014can be used to track pyroclastic flows, which can travel at up to 500 kmh (310 mph) during a volcanic eruption.The catastrophic eruption at Whakaari White Island in 2019 caused a pyroclastic surge of gas and rock that killed 22 people, while an earlier eruption of Te Maari craters in 2012 on Mt. Tongariro also caused pyroclastic flows, resulting in the closure of the Tongariro Alpine Crossing. Around the world more than half of all volcano-related deaths are caused by pyroclastic flows.Dr. Watson says these \"terrifying\" flows are challenging to study because they are sudden, fast-moving, and dangerous. \"It's hard to know what is going on inside a flow because the internal flow dynamics are hidden by an opaque gas cloud which is impossible to see through.\"However, he has used seismic data recorded by a permanent monitoring network at Mt. Etna, Italy, to track a pyroclastic flow that happened in February 2014. His findings have been published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth.\"We've shown that as the pyroclastic flow travels down the flanks of the volcano, it pushes on to Earth's surface producing seismic waves. We can use these seismic signals to track the flow, potentially informing modeling of their flow paths in real time which could help with making hazard assessments for future eruptions.\"By considering how seismic signals get smaller further away from the pyroclastic flow, we can locate the source of these vibrations and track their location over time.\"He says because of the extreme hazard posed by pyroclastic flows there is an urgent need to improve monitoring capabilities. The findings could be applied at volcanoes in New Zealand such as Ruapehu, Tongariro and Taranaki.\"All of the New Zealand volcanoes are able to produce pyroclastic flows, so being able to monitor them better could help improve safety.\"Dr. Watson hopes to carry out further research in the New Zealand context using seismic signals to track lahars (mudflows composed of rock, debris, and water), as well as pyroclastic flows. A lahar from Ruapehu destroyed a bridge over the Whangaehu River causing a train derailment in the 1953 Tangiwai disaster that killed 151 people.\"The ultimate goal is to better understand and monitor volcanic hazards and to use these findings to save lives. This is especially useful as volcanoes are often shrouded in cloud and eruptions can happen during the night when cameras are not effective.\"Dr. Watson has already shown that sound waves can be used to detect mountain avalanches along the Milford Road and is currently working on monitoring avalanche activity in Mount Cook Aoraki National Park.

  "text": "The world must halve single-use plastics and slash throwaway consumption to stem the tide of environmental pollution, according to a UN report on Tuesday that warns the next few years are critical.          Concern is growing about the impacts of plastics, with microplastic fragments found from the deepest oceans trenches to the top of Mount Everest.In humans, they have been detected in blood, breast milk and placentas.The report by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) comes two weeks before negotiators from nearly 200 countries meet in Paris for a new round of negotiations aimed at reaching a legal agreement next year to end plastic pollution.It lays out a three-pronged plan based on reuse, recycling and diversifying the materials used\u2014to help slash plastic pollution 80 percent by 2040 overall and cut single-use plastic production by half.The report cited research estimating plastic could emit 19 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.That would essentially prevent the world from meeting its Paris Agreement commitment to limit the rise in the planet's average surface temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level.\"The way we produce, use and dispose of plastics is polluting ecosystems, creating risks for human health and destabilizing the climate,\" said Inger Andersen, UNEP executive director.She said the roadmap laid out in the report \"dramatically reduces these risks, through adopting a circular approach that keeps plastics out of ecosystems, out of our bodies and in the economy\".                Graphic showing two scenarios of modelled short-lived plastic flows.             In 2020, approximately 238 million metric tons (mmt) of waste from short-lived plastics\u2014such as packaging that ends up in municipal waste\u2014was generated worldwide.Roughly half of that was mismanaged, mostly dumped in the environment or burned.Without significant changes, UNEP expects annual plastic waste to reach 408 mmt by 2040, including 380 mmt of new fossil-fuel-based plastics. That would mean some 227 mmt of plastics would end up in the environment.The report estimates that with a range of \"systems change\" solutions, that pollution figure could be reduced to 41 mmt.But the report says there is no time to waste.\"The next three to five years present a critical window for action to set the world on the path towards implementing the systems change scenario by 2040,\" it warned.      No longer 'disposable'Reuse\u2014as opposed to recycling\u2014was identified as the most effective measure, and would cut plastic pollution up to 30 percent by 2040 with the introduction of things like refillable water bottles, packaging take-back schemes and \"reverse vending machines\".While governments have to incentivise the shift and retailers will need to make it easier to return packaging, consumers will also have to \"forego convenience of disposable and get used to products looking less shiny\".                Reusing containers - particularly things like water bottles is an important way to reduce plastic pollution, the report says.             Better recycling could cut pollution by a fifth, the report found, thanks to policies including the removal of fossil fuel subsidies and the enforcement of design rules to make items easier to treat.An additional 17 percent cut would come from replacing plastics with alternatives, like paper or other compostable materials.The remainder of the pollution cuts would be in better disposal of non-recyclable plastics, which UNEP said would need stronger design and safety standards, as well as rules making manufacturers responsible for products that shed microplastics for example.The report estimates that while there would be significant costs to implementing such sweeping changes, these would be dwarfed by the economic benefits, including from reducing the impacts of pollution on health, climate, air pollution, marine ecosystem degradation.But some campaigners said the report was not ambitious enough in so far as it assumes plastic use will continue at significant levels.\"They have tried to change a pipe, change the valves or whatever, but they are not trying to actually turn off the tap,\" said Hirotaka Koite, of Greenpeace.\"They are not talking about reduction of the production\".But he welcomed the report warnings against plastics falsely presented as \"degradable, compostable\", as well as the support for the removal of fossil fuel subsidies, which makes it cheaper to make new plastic than to recycle.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Coming years 'critical' to slash plastic pollution: UN (2023, May 16)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-years-critical-slash-plastic-pollution.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_squad": " warm ice age",
  "text": "Approximately 700,000 years ago, a \"warm ice age\" permanently changed the climate cycles on Earth. Contemporaneous with this exceptionally warm and moist period, the polar glaciers greatly expanded. A European research team including Earth scientists from Heidelberg University used recently acquired geological data in combination with computer simulations to identify this seemingly paradoxical connection.          According to the researchers, this profound change in the Earth's climate was responsible for the change in the climate cycles, thus representing a critical step in the later climate evolution of our planet. Their study is published in the journal Nature Communications.Geological ice ages\u2014called glacial periods\u2014are characterized by the development of large ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere. In the past 700,000 years, phases shifted between distinct glacial and warm periods about every 100,000 years. Before then, however, the Earth's climate was governed by 40,000-year cycles with shorter and weaker glacial periods. The change in the climate cycles occurred in the Middle Pleistocene Transition period, which began approximately 1.2 million years ago and ended about 670,000 years ago.\"The mechanisms responsible for this critical change in the global climate rhythm remain largely unknown. They cannot be attributed to variations in the orbital parameters governing the Earth's climate,\" explains Associate Professor Dr. Andr\u00e9 Bahr of the Institute of Earth Sciences at Heidelberg University. \"But the recently identified 'warm ice age,' which caused the accumulation of excess continental ice, did play a critical role.\"For their investigations, the researchers used new climate records from a drill core off Portugal and loess records from the Chinese Plateau. The data was then fed into computer simulations. The models show a long-term warming and wetting trend in both subtropical regions for the past 800,000 to 670,000 years.Contemporaneous with this last ice age in the Middle Pleistocene Transition period, the sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic and tropical North Pacific were warmer than in the preceding interglacial, the phase between the two ice ages. This led to higher moisture production and rainfall in Southwest Europe, the expansion of Mediterranean forests, and an enhanced summer monsoon in East Asia. The moisture also reached the polar regions where it contributed to the expansion of the Northern Eurasian ice sheets.\"They persisted for some time and heralded in the phase of sustained and far-reaching ice-age glaciation that lasted until the late Pleistocene. Such expansion of the continental glaciers was necessary to trigger the shift from the 40,000-year cycles to the 100,000-year cycles we experience today, which was critical for the Earth's later climate evolution,\" states Andr\u00e9 Bahr.

  "text": "About 13,000 years ago, a climate crisis caused a global drop in temperatures in the northern hemisphere. This episode of intense cold, known as the Younger Dryas, also caused severe aridity across the Mediterranean basin, which had a major impact on terrestrial and marine ecosystems. But what do we know about the impact of this climate change on water circulation in the Mediterranean?          During the Younger Dryas, the flow of water masses from the eastern Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean through the Strait of Gibraltar doubled, according to a study published in Communications Earth & Environment. The work has applied the innovative technique of neodymium (Nd) isotopes to reconstruct the conditions in the Mediterranean since the last deglaciation, some 14,000 years ago.The study is part of the doctoral thesis being carried out by Sergio Trias-Navarro, under the supervision of Professor Leopoldo Pena and Professor Isabel Cacho, from the consolidated research group in Marine Geosciences (GCR Marine Geosciences) of the Faculty of Earth Sciences of the University of Barcelona. The study presents some of the most relevant results of the European Research Council's TIMED project (ERC-Consolidator), and has an outstanding participation of members of the GCR Marine Geosciences, and experts from La Sapienza University of Rome, the University of Palermo (Italy), and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (Switzerland).The most intense climate change in 13,000 yearsThe Younger Dryas was the most intense climate change of the last 13,000 years and the most far-reaching on a planetary scale. Its end marked the end of the Holocene, the interglacial period in which we find ourselves today. \"There has also been climate variability during the Holocene, such as the episodes known as the Little Ice Age, the Medieval Climatic Anomaly or the Roman Warm Period. However, this climate variability had a lower relative intensity with different regional climatic expressions, without the capacity to generate changes on a global scale,\" says Professor Isabel Cacho, from the UB Department of Earth and Ocean Dynamics.The paper also analyzes the last sapropel, a Holocene episode after the Younger Dryas linked to an extraordinary increase in rainfall in the Mediterranean region, especially in North Africa. The study provides the first quantification of changes in the deep circulation of the eastern Mediterranean during this episode, and it has estimated that it was reduced by up to a quarter compared to the Younger Dryas. Still, the experts explain that the impact this event may have had on the oceanography of the North Atlantic is unknown.The new study supports the hypothesis that increased salt input from the Mediterranean into Atlantic waters during the Younger Dryas was key to reactivating the North Atlantic circulation: this led to a rapid warming in Europe and the Mediterranean, which marked the beginning of the Holocene.\"Mediterranean water masses are one of the primary sources of salt in the North Atlantic. Water salinity is an important factor in oceanography, as it determines the density of water masses. It is therefore a key process in the formation of deep waters in the Atlantic Ocean and is the driver of global ocean circulation,\" says researcher Sergio Trias-Navarro.      A technical innovation to study the oceans of the pastAs in other previous studies conducted by the GRC Marine Geosciences, the team has applied the innovative technique of neodymium radiogenic isotopes as geochemical tracers to reconstruct the oceanographic conditions of the past. This analytical study has been carried out in the LIRA and PANTHALASSA laboratories, unique research support facilities in Catalonia located in areas of the Faculty of Earth Sciences and the UB's Scientific and Technological Centers (CCiTUB) and coordinated by experts Leopoldo Pena and Isabel Cacho.\"Compared to other types of geochemical tracers, Nd isotopes have the great advantage of being conservative. Therefore, they do not interact with or are not affected by biological processes, for example, biological productivity or the degradation of organic matter,\" says Professor Leopoldo Pena, co-author of the paper. \"This technique allows us to go beyond time and it can be applied to oceanographic reconstructions of both the present and the past. It allows us to understand the dynamics of the ocean and reconstruct oceanography long before we could observe or measure it ourselves with other scientific tools,\" adds the expert.Younger Dryas: A mirror for the Mediterranean of the future?There are still many enigmas about the potential impact of Mediterranean waters on the North Atlantic circulation. Despite the scientific interest, \"much of the oceanographic studies focusing on the Atlantic Ocean do not consider the Mediterranean, and perhaps the role of Mediterranean waters in the Atlantic circulation has been downplayed,\" note the authors.The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) presents the Younger Dryas as an example of the predictable changes in rainfall that will take place in the Mediterranean as a consequence of an expected reduction in the circulation of the North Atlantic. \"On the other hand, according to projections for the end of the 21st century, the Mediterranean circulation will weaken and, consequently, so will its contribution to the Atlantic Ocean,\" says Isabel Cacho, coordinator of the TIMED project. In the current context of climate change, studies such as this one are increasingly necessary to better understand the sensitivity of the Mediterranean circulation to different climatic situations.\"The Younger Dryas is not a perfect analogue for future changes, as we are currently facing a much more amplified greenhouse effect. Still, our study reveals that the change in aridity which is expected by the end of the century is capable of inducing an intensification of the Mediterranean circulation, although the projected warming could counteract this effect. For this reason, we need to better understand the relative weight that these two variables\u2014temperature and humidity\u2014have had on the evolution of the Mediterranean circulation,\" concludes the research team.

  "text": "Urban floods. Extreme heat. Hurricane storm surges. Polar vortices. Droughts and wildfires. Many casual conversations these days seem to open with anecdotes about the weather and, unfortunately, the effects of a changing climate on the environment, energy infrastructure, economy, and people.          The consequences of changing Earth systems are global. And they are demonstrably growing. What will the future look like, and how can our society plan to adapt to that future?There is an urgent need for credible U.S. projections that have finely detailed views across space and time, says Paul Ullrich, a professor of regional climate modeling at the University of California, Davis.Such information, he adds, would give the research community \"targeted regional climate impact simulations\" that clarify local effects on infrastructure and society.TGW simulations: Modeling possible futuresTo address these needs, a group of DOE-funded scientists recently released a set of high-resolution scenarios that span a range of plausible changes in U.S. climate over the 21st century. The approach is called thermodynamic global warming (TGW).These scenarios are the result of a collaborative effort between two U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) projects, Integrated Multisector, Multiscale Modeling (IM3) and A Framework for Improving Analysis and Modeling of Earth System and Intersectoral Dynamics at Regional Scales (HyperFACETS). The two projects are funded by DOE's Earth & Environmental Systems Modeling program's MultiSector Dynamics and Regional & Global Model Analysis program areas, respectively. The two teams worked together to create future scenarios, developing four simulations that look 80 years into the future of the United States, from 2020 to 2099.                In this simulation of a future North America, purple and dark red indicate areas of more intense surface temperatures. Left to right: A historic heat wave event from 2012, the historic event replayed in 2052, and the historic event replayed in 2092 for one of the four scenarios.\u00a0Credit: U.S. Department of Energy             The scenarios span a wide range of future warming possibilities and are designed to show how the events of the previous 40 years (1980\u20132019) would \"replay\" under warmer conditions. Each historic event replays eight times in the simulations (once in each of the two 40-year future periods for each of the four scenarios).Jennie Rice, a senior research scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and IM3's Principal Investigator, explains that the TGW simulations indicate potential increases in extreme event intensity, geographic scope, and duration, including how previously non-extreme events could become extreme under a warmer future. \"For example,\" she says, \"for each heat wave or cold snap that occurred between 1980\u20132019, these data sets provide eight future instances of those events that can be used to show how previous challenges to the electricity grid could worsen under more extreme conditions.\"According to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) scientist Andrew Jones, events captured in the simulations include every type of extreme experienced over the 40-year historic period\u2014droughts, storms, dry wind events that increase the risk for wildfire, and compound events in which multiple extremes occur simultaneously.\"What is especially unique about this approach is that we reproduce known historic events that led to stress on our infrastructure and society,\" says Jones. \"For example, these include the deadly Chicago heatwave of 1995 and the back-to-back storms behind the 2017 Oroville dam disaster.\"Jones notes that reproducing known events is useful for validating modeled impacts of these events on society and our adaptive responses. \"This approach also provides a perspective on the future that is grounded in our experience of the past, enabling us to systematically examine how those memorable events might play out under various levels of future warming,\" he says. \"By applying this technique to such a large historic period and large geographic area, we can also examine how our findings translate to similar events in different contexts. Several past studies have only focused on one event or on a shorter time period.\"The research team cautions that the TGW approach is not intended to estimate future changes in the overall frequency of extreme events linked to changes in large-scale atmospheric dynamics.                A TGW simulation shows precipitation due to Hurricane Irma under four future scenarios, including historically simulated precipitation and observations.\u00a0Credit: U.S. Department of Energy             The simulations were led by LBNL scientists Jones (IM3 and HyperFACETS) and Pouya Vahmani (IM3), and Oak Ridge National Laboratory scientist Deeksha Rastogi (IM3).They used the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (version 4.2.1) to provide physical consistency across 25 hourly and more than 200 three-hourly climate variables with high spatiotemporal (space and time) resolution for the entire 80 years of each simulation. It took over a year to complete the simulations on one of the most powerful high-performance computing systems in the U.S. The TGW Simulations team currently has a paper in preparation.      Freely available data setsThe TGW simulation data sets are publicly available and more fully described on this landing page that includes instructions for downloading them via Globus, a file-transfer application and download manager. Many computing clusters provide mechanisms for transferring files from Globus endpoints.Jones encourages the climate modeling community to download the data, apply it to their research, and collaborate with the TGW simulations team. The IM3 and HyperFACETS teams are currently incorporating the simulation results into their research. \"There is so much rich information in this data set,\" he says. \"Our hope is that the data unlocks a series of extreme event-focused climate impacts and adaptation studies that were previously not possible.\"This data set has not been corrected for bias. A bias-corrected version is under development and will be released on the TGW Simulations website when available. More information:For Data Set, see: Andrew D.

  "text": "In a first, US climate scientists have quantified the extent to which greenhouse gasses from the world's top fossil fuel companies have contributed to wildfires.          Their analysis, published Tuesday in Environmental Research Letters, found that carbon dioxide and methane emissions from the so-called \"Big 88\" firms were responsible for more than a third of the area scorched by forest blazes in western North America over the past 40 years.First author Kristina Dahl, of the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), told AFP wildfires in the western United States and southwestern Canada have been worsening for decades: they are burning more intensely, over longer seasons, covering larger areas and reaching higher elevations.To date, the cost of rebuilding and increasing resilience has largely been footed by the general public, \"so we wanted to better understand the role that fossil fuel industry emissions have had in altering the wildfire landscape,\" she said.\"We really wanted to put a spotlight on their role in that, so that they can be held accountable for their fair share of the cost.\"'Atmospheric thirst'Using climate modeling, the team determined that emissions from the Big 88\u2014which includes ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron and Shell\u2014were responsible for increasing global average temperatures by 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit (0.5 degrees Celsius) since the start of the 20th century, or roughly half of the observed warming.For the purposes of this study, the authors included all emissions across the life cycle of fossil fuels\u2014from extraction and flaring operations to refinement and use inside a vehicle, for example.The companies' contribution to planet-wide warming was then used to calculate how much they added to a rise in \"vapor pressure deficit\" or VPD\u2014 a measure of air's ability to draw water out of plants and soils\u2014within the western North America region.Because warmer air can hold more water vapor, rising temperatures caused by climate change are causing this measure of atmospheric thirst to increase too.A higher VPD makes an area more fire prone, and recent research has established a clear exponential relationship between increases in this aridity indicator and the area burned by forest fires.Combining all these elements, Dahl's research team found that emissions from the Big 88 were responsible for 37 percent of the total area razed by forest fires in western United States and southwestern Canada between 1986, when reliable fire area data became available, and 2021.That is 19.8 million acres (8 million hectares)\u2014an area roughly the size of the Czech Republic.The study also found that emissions from the same companies were responsible for nearly half of the observed increase in VPD since 1901.Other factors that increased fire danger conditions over the last century include aggressive fire suppression that led to large buildups of vegetation that normally would have burned in smaller regularly occurring fires, often managed by Indigenous communities.Accidental ignitions have also increased as humans encroached into fire-prone areas.Growing area of researchThe research builds on an accumulating body of climate \"attribution\" studies, which have calculated how much greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels have contributed to global temperature increases, sea level rise, and ocean acidification.Such work has paved the way for impacted communities to seek redress through lawsuits, said Dahl, and helps shift the conversation about tackling climate change away from individual responsibility.\"Lowering our individual carbon footprints is a narrative that has been very heavily pushed by the fossil fuel industry,\" she said.\"While individuals need to make the best choices we can, we also have to acknowledge that we're living in a reality that's been shaped by these companies and our choices have been constrained because of them.\"The UCS is pushing for government investigations into past and ongoing disinformation campaigns by industry aimed at denying climate science that was predicted by the companies' own internal modeling.

  "text": "A study recently published in the journal Science China Earth Sciences was led by Dr. Chen of the Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Based on the principle of turbulence correlation and ensemble averaging, his team first used four-site observations of atmospheric turbulence under complex conditions.       On the basis of the fact that atmospheric turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer is usually random and stationary, the time series data of each point were combined with the spatial distribution to form a long time series. This can be used to analyze the various states of regional turbulence observation, and to more comprehensively analyze turbulence structure and estimate turbulence spectra.Using the four-site observation data under the complex conditions of the Loess Plateau region, it was demonstrated that the various states of turbulence can be more easily satisfied with four-site turbulence observations on the scale of the entire atmospheric boundary layer (<1 hour time scale).The comparison between the velocity second-order structure function determined by a single site and the velocity second-order structure function between two sites directly verified the theory of turbulence correlation. Therefore, the turbulence structure and turbulence flux determined by the newly established long time series data are more representative of the regional turbulence field.

  "text": "Tropical cyclones (TCs) are responsible for significant damage to property and human life. The size and intensity of these storms are critical factors in determining the level of destruction they can cause. However, the relationship between a TC's size and intensity during its development phase has been difficult to understand.          Now, a team of researchers led by Prof. Chen Guanghua from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has revealed this relationship by examining the wind field structure of TCs during their formation.The researchers analyzed the relative impacts of two critical parameters\u2014the radius of maximum wind (RMW) and the radial decay of winds outside the RMW\u2014on the degree of size expansion under the same level of intensity increment.The study was published in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences on May 12.They found that vortexes with larger RMW and broader wind fields tended to expand more under the same level of intensity increment, highlighting the importance of paying attention to incipient storms with large RMW.The researchers also discovered that RMW played a major role in the size-intensity relationship. Increasing the initial RMW significantly slowed down the organization and development of the eyewall convection, leading to slow intensifying. On the other hand, initially broader winds allowed for active outer convection and were favorable for size expansion, which could lower wind transports to the inner region and impede intensification when the RMW was large.\"This study is a preliminary attempt to comprehend physical mechanisms responsible for the variation of size-intensity relationship,\" said Prof. Chen. \"Further research is ongoing to incorporate more complex internal and external forces.\"Understanding the size and intensity relationship of TCs is crucial for estimating their potential destruction. The findings of this study can help to improve our ability to predict and prepare for these devastating natural disasters.

  "text": "Researchers found that emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas dropped for several years near the nation's second-largest metropolitan area.          Two recent studies by researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California used contrasting approaches to measure drops in human-caused emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane in recent years in the Los Angeles region.In the first study, published in February in Environmental Research Letters, scientists analyzed data from ground-based sensors scattered around four counties in densely populated Southern California: Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, and Riverside. They found emissions fell by about 7% between 2015 and 2020\u2014a reduction of 33 million pounds (15 million kilograms) of methane released per year.The second study, published in March in Environmental Research Communications, compared emissions from a belt of oil refineries across the South Bay area of Los Angeles during the first summer of the COVID-19 pandemic to those observed three years earlier. Using data from a NASA airborne instrument, researchers saw that most of the facilities they identified as methane sources in the earlier campaign were no longer emitting the greenhouse gas, leading to a 73% reduction in measured emissions. While such a reduction around COVID disruptions was not necessarily surprising, the result was important for demonstrating scientists' ability to track point sources of methane.Methane has a much shorter atmospheric lifespan than carbon dioxide\u2014around 12 years, compared to centuries for carbon dioxide\u2014but it absorbs much more energy while it exists in the atmosphere. Therefore, reducing human-caused emissions of the gas is a particularly effective way to make significant, short-term impacts on global climate change.\"These papers demonstrate that methane reductions are not only possible, they're measurable through persistent monitoring,\" said Andrew Thorpe, lead author of the COVID-period study and a JPL research technologist.That two studies could use different techniques to identify and quantify emissions trends is crucial for generating confidence in the conclusions drawn from methane observations, added Vineet Yadav, a JPL data scientist and lead author of the first paper.\"The important thing is to determine whether emissions are increasing or declining, and for that it's helpful to have more than one approach,\" said Yadav, whose study employs two techniques. \"If you are turning the information over to decision-makers, you have to be sure.\"      Focusing on the regionYadav's paper is based on measurements from eight spectroscopic sensors that were installed as part of the Megacities Carbon Project, a multiagency collaboration currently monitoring greenhouse gases in the Los Angeles, Indianapolis, and Washington areas. The sensors have been gathering data across a large swath of Southern California since 2015 and enabled researchers to study an area that stretches from the beaches of Malibu in the west to the mountains and deserts of San Bernardino and Riverside counties in the east. It also extends south through all of Orange County.The researchers found that month-to-month fluctuations in methane concentrations measured at each sensor tower gradually fell from 2015 to 2020 and well into 2022\u2014a strong indication that local emissions of the gas were also decreasing. Then, using a mathematical model to estimate the emissions decrease, Yadav and colleagues found the areas covered by the Granada Hills and Ontario sensors accounted for much of the drop in annual emissions from 2015 to 2020.Although the paper doesn't cite causes of the emission reductions in those two locales, Yadav suspects they resulted from better management of natural gas pipelines and equipment, which in turn led to lower fugitive\u2014or accidental\u2014methane releases. Improved infrastructure at a massive waste site near Granada Hills likely also played a role.Focusing on refineriesRather than analyzing data from ground sensors, the study focusing on oil refineries uses measurements made by an imaging spectrometer called AVIRIS-NG (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation). Attached to the bottom of an aircraft, the instrument can detect greenhouse gas emissions from individual facilities or even pieces of equipment by looking at how the gases absorb sunlight.In 2016 and 2017, AVIRIS-NG was flown over 22,000 square miles (57,000 square kilometers) of the state as part of the California Methane Survey. From July to September 2020, researchers retraced some of those flight paths over refineries and power plants in Los Angeles County and over oilfields in central California's San Joaquin Valley.The 2020 surveys over Los Angeles identified only 11 plumes from five refinery sources, with a total emissions rate of about 712 pounds (323 kilograms) of methane per hour. The 2016 and '17 flights had found 48 plumes from 33 sources, with a total emissions rate of roughly 2,639 pounds (1,197 kilograms methane) per hour.The drop correlates with an 18% decrease in monthly production in Southern California refineries between the two flight campaigns, the scientists noted, citing data from the California Energy Commission. The study also found that emissions from oilfields in and around the city of Bakersfield in central California fell 34.2%, correlating with a 24.2% drop in oil production.Thorpe said that reduced production during the pandemic due to lower demand for fuel and depressed oil prices could have led to the drop in methane emissions, as oilfields and refineries emitted less methane during operations. However, he added, improved equipment maintenance and mitigation efforts at those facilities between 2016 and 2020 can't be ruled out as a factor.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's estimate of global atmospheric methane concentration accelerated after 2020, \"underscoring the critical need to reduce emissions,\" Thorpe writes in the paper. Being able to accurately detect and measure emissions is a key step, both he and Yadav said.

  "question_squad": " What is the most common material in plastic?",
  "answer_squad": " polyethylene",
  "text": "Researchers from Kyushu University and Asahi Kasei Corporation have developed a new way to estimate the age of microplastics found in the upper oceans. The method involves a combination of analyzing plastic oxidation levels with environmental factors such as UV exposure and ambient temperature.          The team applied their new method to estimate the age of microplastics found in nearshore and offshore sites in the North Pacific Ocean. They found that the age of microplastics in nearshore regions ranged from zero to five years old, whereas microplastics from offshore regions ranged from one to three years old. Their findings are published in the journal, Marine Pollution Bulletin.In marine environments from lakes to oceans, plastics are the most abundant type of pollutant. As plastic waste is exposed to the elements they eventually break down and fragment. Plastic waste that has broken down to less than 5 mm in length are called \"microplastics.\"\"Microplastic pollution is recognized as a global problem. In a previous study, we found that there are about 24 trillion grains of microplastics floating on the surface layer of the ocean,\" explains Professor Atsuhiko Isobe of Kyushu University's Research Institute for Applied Mechanics, who led the study. \"However, there is still little we know about its effects on the environment or to living creatures. Another big question we have is how long microplastics drift through the ocean.\"                Dr Okubo looking through a microscope studying microplastic samples. Plastic fragments less than 5 mm in length are categorized as microplastics. Credit: Kyushu University/Asahi Kasei Corporation             To find out how old microplastics found in the ocean can be, Isobe and his team began by investigating what metrics could be used to measure microplastic age in the first place.\"The most common material in plastic is called polyethylene. We know that as polyethylene interacts with the environment it, oxidizes and degrades,\" explains Rie Okubo, a researcher at Asahi Kasei Corporation and first author of the study. \"This degradation level can be measured using the change in the material's molecular weight and something called the carbonyl index. Simply, when polyethylene degrades its carbonyl index increases and molecular weight decreases.\"Of course, that's not enough. Since microplastics are being exposed to the elements the team also needed to standardize how temperature and UV radiation affects plastic degradation. The team first conducted a series of exposure experiments to polyethylene material and collected data on how various combinations of UV and temperature affected the material's molecular weight and carbonyl index.                Prof Atsuhiko Isobe and crew collecting microplastic samples from the upper oceans. The upper ocean is measured down to one meter from the water surface. Credit: Kyushu University/Isobe Lab             The team found that UVER\u2014ultraviolet erythemal radiation, a measurement of UV radiation at ground level\u2014and seawater temperature were the two biggest contributors of plastic degradation.\"Once we had this data, we began to apply it to our microplastic samples. All our samples came from the upper ocean, up to one meter from the water surface,\" continues Okubo. \"We also collected microplastics from a range of areas. Some samples were collected nearshore to Japan, ranging from 10 to 80 km off the coast. Other samples were collected offshore, in the middle of the North Pacific Ocean and Philippine Sea.\"By analyzing the collected microplastics, the team was able to estimate the age of each induvial sample. They found that nearshore microplastics ranged from zero to five years old, whereas offshore samples ranged from one to three years old.                Prof Atsuhiko Isobe and gathering the microplastic samples collected from the upper ocean. Credit: Kyushu University/Isobe Lab             \"We hypothesize the reason why nearshore microplastics range from zero to five years is because they are being frequently washed ashore and 'surviving' for a longer time. Offshore microplastics on the other hand take longer to reach that part of the ocean, hence why we didn't find microplastics over three years old,\" Okubo explains. \"These offshore microplastics are also likely removed from the upper oceans by settling deeper into the waters.\"The researchers hope that the new method will give them better insights into how microplastics are generated and spread in the environment. The data will also help in developing more accurate simulations to track microplastics across the ocean.Isobe concludes, \"Our research and understanding of microplastics is still very new, and thanks to this data we've gained a little more understanding on the fundamental science of microplastics. Our next step will be to investigate how mechanical stimuli like ocean waves and currents can degrade plastics, so we can collect even more accurate data.\" More information:Rie Okubo et al, Estimation of the age of polyethylene microplastics collected from oceans: Application to the western North Pacific Ocean, Marine Pollution Bulletin (2023).

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the 72-foot schooner that floated above a shipwreck?",
  "answer_squad": " Marie Tharp",
  "text": "In the sunlight of a May afternoon on the Chesapeake Bay, a 72-foot schooner called the Marie Tharp floated above a shipwreck from long ago.          The boat's instruments were hard at work, mapping the ruins of the sunken wooden steam freighter, the New Jersey, using sonar equipment affixed to its hull.But that effort Thursday afternoon was just a test, and the Chesapeake Bay a proving ground, for mapping the previously uncharted.On Monday, the crew of the Marie Tharp will set sail from Annapolis for Greenland to begin mapping the seabed around the massive North Atlantic island and analyze the environmental impacts of glacial melting caused by a warming climate.The ship is named after Tharp, a woman whose work charting the ocean floor, and revealing its peaks and valleys, laid the groundwork for the theory of continental drift. However, she wasn't allowed aboard research ships due to her sex. Tharp died in 2006 at the age of 86.From Annapolis, the ship will sail north to the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, and go out through Delaware Bay to reach the Atlantic Ocean. In early June, the ship is scheduled to reach St. John's, Newfoundland. Next, the crew must traverse the Labrador Sea\u2014known for its punishing conditions mingling fog, gale-force winds and ice\u2014to reach Nuuk, Greenland.From there, the crew will explore a series of fjords, which are estuaries formed by glaciers, along the coast of Greenland and even further north in the Canadian Arctic, near Devon and Ellesmere islands.During their travels, they will gather seabed and water samples to assess the health of bodies of water in the wake of glacial retreat. Additionally, they will be charting what's below.It will be the second Arctic voyage for the Marie Tharp, a steel-hulled sailboat constructed in 2000 that serves as home base for the nonprofit Ocean Research Project. This type of voyage is nothing new for the Annapolis-based organization's founder\u2014Matt Rutherford.Rutherford is best known for being the first to complete a nonstop solo sail circumnavigating North and South America. But after his 2011 trip, during which he \"caught more plastic trash than I caught fish,\" Rutherford founded the Ocean Research Project, and\u2014joined by scientist Nicole Trenholm of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science\u2014decided to use his sailing prowess to map the eastern side of the North Atlantic Garbage Patch, a collection of microplastic and other trash concentrated by ocean currents.      In 2015, the nonprofit's attention turned to climate change research, and it teamed up with NASA's Ocean Melting Greenland Program to conduct research in the coldest northern reaches of the planet.The idea was simple, but groundbreaking. Aboard his small sailboat, Rutherford could conduct research more cheaply and efficiently than with a large icebreaker, which would burn far more fuel along the way. But it takes tremendous skill\u2014and a \"sailor's intuition\"\u2014to avoid icebergs and endure storms and fog without the safety net that a heftier vessel provides, Rutherford said.It quickly became clear that the nonprofit was outgrowing its aging sailboat, which\u2014at 42 feet\u2014could only hold about four people at once.Enter the Marie Tharp, a Bruce Roberts Voyager 650 that hardly had been sailed at all when it was donated to the nonprofit. Outfitting the boat, which had fallen into disrepair, for dangerous voyages north required significant work. The coronavirus pandemic found Rutherford living in a boat yard on his new ship, a layer of saw dust coating his bed and his belongings as he completed the repairs.After the Tharp's first trip to Greenland last year, there were a few kinks to work out, Rutherford said. For one thing, the boat's multi-beam sonar system was attached to a pole in front of the boat, frequently endangered by ice formations and the elements. But now it is stowed on the bottom of the boat, protected by metal shark fins that will work to divert potentially damaging ice chunks.During the trip, the Marie Tharp and her passengers (seven to nine people, including a rotating cast of scientists with Arctic research to complete) will visit what Trenholm called the \"dirtiest fjord in all of Greenland,\" located near the southwestern town of Paamiut.Water from melting glaciers have filled that fjord with excess sediment, which carries nutrients capable of upending the ecosystem's balance\u2014the same phenomena playing out in an estuary closer to home: the Chesapeake Bay.The water quality research collected by the Tharp and her crew will offer a critical snapshot of the current conditions stemming from climate change in the Arctic, assisting efforts to predict the future. And the seabed samples will tell the story of the fjord's history before glacier melt, in the same way rings on a trunk chart the life of a tree.The Ocean Research Project's latest trip has attracted the attention of consumer advocate and environmentalist Ralph Nader, now 89-years-old, whose great nephew Adnaan Stumo is a crew member.Nader, who ran four times for president, said he was struck by Rutherford's effort to make climate research cheaper and greener, calling it a bright spot amid otherwise distressing subject matter.\"There's so much grim reality in this climate violence, climate catastrophe,\" Nader said. \"And he's quite a unique person.\"Stumo, an experienced sailor who has completed trips across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, said he learned about the Ocean Research Project while listening to Rutherford\u2014one of his sailing heroes\u2014speak on a podcast. When Rutherford mentioned that he was seeking sailors for his next voyage, Stumo reached out. And soon enough, he was set to join Rutherford and make his very first trip to the Arctic.This year, the crew is all volunteer. After a critical funding source dried up, none of the crew members will receive a salary during the five-month voyage, though all the research activities are paid for.That news did not deter Stumo.\"I thought about it for a minute,\" he said. \"But at the end of the day, if I wanted to get rich, I would be doing something else.\"The crew is mostly women, which is a first for sailor and shipwright Allie Gretzinger.\"Usually, I'm the only female or there's maybe one other,\" said Gretzinger, who also will be making her first voyage to the Arctic aboard the Marie Tharp.Over the past several weeks, Gretzinger and Stumo and have been among those helping Rutherford prepare the boat. For Stumo, that has included installing a wind generator while \"swinging high in the air trying not to drop tools\" and a Costco haul for the ages, featuring massive amounts of dry and canned goods, from pasta to tuna.The bill? More than $3,500, he said.\"The girls behind the counter were kind of wide-eyed, like: 'Are you having a party?'\" Stumo said.But a party it won't be. Stumo and the crew will battle the elements, navigating narrow fjords and dodging submerged icebergs the size of school buses.Of course, that is all part of the adventure. But Stumo said he is more energized by the knowledge that he will be contributing to climate change research conducted in a \"unique window\" in time, as glaciers packed with geological clues recede into the land.In addition, he is sailing with the memory of his sister Samya Stumo, who perished at 24-years-old in the 2019 Ethiopian Airlines crash that took the lives of all 149 passengers and crew. At the time, Samya Stumo was heading to Kenya for her first project with a health systems development organization, trying to fulfill health care needs for vulnerable communities.\"She would have had a 50-plus-year career and touched so many lives,\" Stumo said. \"So, I am trying to do my small part and keep her in mind.\"    2023 The Baltimore Sun.

  "text": "The death toll from Cyclone Mocha which barrelled through the Bay of Bengal rose on Monday as contact was slowly restored to western Myanmar, with 29 people reported dead.          Cyclone Mocha made landfall between Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh and Myanmar's Sittwe carrying winds of up to 195 kilometers (120 miles) per hour, the biggest storm to hit the Bay of Bengal in more than a decade.The storm had largely passed by late Sunday, sparing the refugee camps housing almost a million Rohingya in Bangladesh, where officials said there had been no deaths.Twenty four people were killed in Khaung Doke Kar village tract northwest of Sittwe, a Rohingya camp leader told AFP, requesting anonymity due to fear of reprisals from the junta.Several others were feared missing from the low-lying tract, home to Rohingya villages and IDP camps, he said.AFP footage from the area showed wooden fishing boats smashed to splinters and piled up near the shore.At least five people were killed in Myanmar and \"some residents\" were injured, the military junta said in an earlier statement, without giving details.More than 860 houses and 14 hospitals or clinics had been damaged across the country, it said.Communications were still patchy on Monday with Rakhine state's capital Sittwe, home to around 150,000 people and which bore the brunt of the storm according to cyclone trackers.                A man fixes his house's roof which was destroyed by Cyclone Mocha, on Shahpori island on the outskirts of Teknaf, Bangladesh.             Hundreds of people who had sheltered on higher ground were returning to the city along a road littered with trees, pylons and power cables, AFP correspondents said.In Sittwe, power pylons hung low over deserted streets and trees still standing were stripped of leaves.At least five people had died in the city and around 25 had been injured, local rescue worker Ko Lin Lin told AFP.It was not clear whether any of them were included in the death toll in the junta's statement.Mocha made landfall on Sunday, bringing a storm surge and high winds that toppled a communications tower in Sittwe, according to images published on social media.\"I was in a Buddhist monastery when the storm came,\" one resident told AFP.\"The prayer hall and monk dining hall have collapsed. We had to move from this building and that building. Now roads are blocked as trees and pylons are fallen.\"Junta-affiliated media reported that the storm had put hundreds of base stations, which connect mobile phones to networks, out of action in Rakhine.                The track and forecast track of Cyclone Mocha as of May 14, the Bay of Bengal's first cyclone of the year.             'Extensive damage'The United Nations said communications problems meant it had not yet been able to assess the damage in Rakhine, which has been ravaged by ethnic conflict for years.\"Early reports suggest the damage is extensive,\" the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late on Sunday.Bangladesh officials said they had evacuated 750,000 people.Secretary of the disaster management ministry, Kamrul Hasan, told AFP on Monday no one had died in the cyclone.The damage was also minimal in the Rohingya camps, where about a million people live in 190,000 bamboo and tarpaulin shelters, officials said.\"Although the impact of the cyclone could have been much worse, the refugee camps have been severely affected, leaving thousands desperately needing help,\" the UN said as it made a urgent appeal for aid.Jomila Banu, a 20-year-old Rohingya woman from Nayapara refugee camp at Teknaf, said, \"The roof of my home has been blown away by the wind, now I am eating rice under the open sky with my children.\"                A man walks past fallen trees after Cyclone Mocha crashed ashore, in Kyauktaw in Myanmar's Rakhine state.             Better forecasting and more effective evacuation planning have dramatically reduced the death toll from such storms in recent years.Scientists have warned that storms are becoming more powerful as the world gets warmer because of climate change.Cyclones\u2014the equivalent of hurricanes in the North Atlantic or typhoons in the Northwest Pacific\u2014are a regular and deadly menace on the coast of the northern Indian Ocean where tens of millions of people live.Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar's Irrawaddy Delta in 2008, killing at least 138,000 people.The then-junta faced international criticism for its response to the disaster. It was accused of blocking emergency aid and initially refusing to grant access to humanitarian workers and supplies.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Cyclone Mocha death toll rises to 29 in Myanmar (2023, May 15)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-cyclone-mocha-death-toll-myanmar.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "When it comes to reducing pollution in the Chesapeake Bay, throwing more money at the problem may not be enough.          A new independent study suggests better tactics are needed in order to improve the health of the bay and its estuaries.For the past four years, the Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee, an independent entity that provides scientific advice to the regional Chesapeake Bay Program partnership, has reviewed and researched why meeting water quality goals has taken longer than anticipated.The report, released May 9, says some improvement has been made in the 40 years since the original Chesapeake Bay Agreement was signed. But it says recent progress to reduce pollutants have been lagging.In 1983, the governors of Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia, the mayor of Washington and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator signed the first joint commitment to addressing the historical decline of the bay's health. Over the years, that mission has evolved and expanded, but the reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus in the watershed has always been central to that effort.According to the report, watershed models estimated that nitrogen loads to the bay were reduced from 370 million pounds per year in 1985 to approximately 258 million pounds per year in 2021. Phosphorus loads were reduced from 29 million pounds per year in 1985 to approximately 15 million pounds per year in 2021.\"However, modeling and monitoring evidence indicates that current efforts to reduce nutrient loads will not meet the (total maximum daily load) targets,\" the report reads. \"In addition, the (Chesapeake Bay Program's) ambient water quality monitoring program indicates that estuary water quality has been slow to respond to realized nutrient and sediment reductions in many regions of the Bay. The CBP has estimated that 27% of the Bay area met the water quality standards in 1985. By 2020, that figure had only risen to the mid-30% range. The consequences for living resources have not been fully evaluated.\"Specifically, improvement has been made in point sources, or wastewater treatment plants, but progress in other areas like farms and developed land is \"insufficient\" for current goals. Water quality standards are measured by chlorophyll (an indicator of algae growth), underwater grass abundance (an indication of water clarity) and dissolved oxygen levels. This represents the conditions necessary to support the living resources, such as oysters or fish in the bay.\"Moving the needle on improving Bay water quality will require more than just money and effort\u2014it will require new approaches to implementation,\" Dr. Kurt Stephenson, professor in the department of agricultural and applied economics at Virginia Tech, said in a statement. \"We hope this report provides the Chesapeake Bay Program with ideas on how to improve nonpoint source programs and increase the potential of water quality management to improve living resources.\"The report states that plant and animal species are not dependent on water quality standards alone. Instead, they will likely be affected by a variety of future conditions including disease, water temperature and salinity levels, commercial and recreational harvests and nearshore habitat. The reports says changing conditions\u2014such as human population growth, land use and climate change\u2014will make future restoration \"more challenging.\"\"The Chesapeake Bay and its surrounding watershed are critical to the livelihood of all its 18 million residents, and changes in land use, population growth, economic development and climate change mean that its past conditions cannot be recreated; the Bay of the future will not be the same as the Bay of the past,'\" Denice Wardrop, research professor of geography at Penn State and executive secretary of STAC, said.\"However, significant opportunities exist to improve the effectiveness of our actions, achieving a Bay of equal vitality by building on the significant learnings of the past.\"    2023 The Virginian-Pilot.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "answer_race": " To introduce a new computational tool.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the tool that pinpoints specific counties?",
  "answer_squad": " STRESS platform",
  "text": "A computational tool developed by researchers at the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change pinpoints specific counties within the United States that are particularly vulnerable to economic distress resulting from a transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy sources.          By combining county-level data on employment in fossil fuel (oil, natural gas, and coal) industries with data on populations below the poverty level, the tool identifies locations with high risks for transition-driven economic hardship. It turns out that many of these high-risk counties are in the south-central U.S., with a heavy concentration in the lower portions of the Mississippi River.The computational tool, which the researchers call the System for the Triage of Risks from Environmental and Socio-economic Stressors (STRESS) platform, almost instantly displays these risk combinations on an easy-to-read visual map, revealing those counties that stand to gain the most from targeted green jobs retraining programs.Drawing on data that characterize land, water, and energy systems; biodiversity; demographics; environmental equity; and transportation networks, the STRESS platform enables users to assess multiple, co-evolving, compounding hazards within a U.S. geographical region from the national to the county level. Because of its comprehensiveness and precision, this screening-level visualization tool can pinpoint risk \"hot spots\" that can be subsequently investigated in greater detail. Decision-makers can then plan targeted interventions to boost resilience to location-specific physical and economic risks.The platform and its applications are highlighted in a new study in the journal Frontiers in Climate.\"As risks to natural and managed resources\u2014and to the economies that depend upon them\u2014become more complex, interdependent, and compounding amid rapid environmental and societal changes, they require more and more human and computational resources to understand and act upon,\" says MIT Joint Program Deputy Director C. Adam Schlosser, the lead author of the study. \"The STRESS platform provides decision-makers with an efficient way to combine and analyze data on those risks that matter most to them, identify 'hot spots' of compounding risk, and design interventions to minimize that risk.\"In one demonstration of the STRESS platform's capabilities, the study shows that national and global actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could simultaneously reduce risks to land, water, and air quality in the upper Mississippi River basin while increasing economic risks in the lower basin, where poverty and unemployment are already disproportionate. In another demonstration, the platform finds concerning \"hot spots\" where flood risk, poverty, and nonwhite populations coincide.The risk triage platform is based on an emerging discipline called multi-sector dynamics (MSD), which seeks to understand and model compounding risks and potential tipping points across interconnected natural and human systems. Tipping points occur when these systems can no longer sustain multiple, co-evolving stresses, such as extreme events, population growth, land degradation, drinkable water shortages, air pollution, aging infrastructure, and increased human demands.MSD researchers use observations and computer models to identify key precursory indicators of such tipping points, providing decision-makers with critical information that can be applied to mitigate risks and boost resilience in natural and managed resources. The MIT Joint Program has since 2018 been developing MSD expertise and modeling tools and using them to explore compounding risks and potential tipping points in selected regions of the United States.Current STRESS platform data includes more than 100 risk metrics at the county-level scale, but data collection is ongoing. MIT Joint Program researchers are continuing to develop the STRESS platform as an \"open-science tool\" that welcomes input from academics, researchers, industry and the general public.

  "text": "Electric vehicles, or EVs, promise to reduce carbon emissions and serve as a tool to help mitigate climate change, but a team of Penn State researchers report there has been little research to determine how equitable the benefits of EVs are and, in fact, whether the technology may unfairly harm some areas and populations.          In a study, the researchers only found 48 papers out of a pool of 9,838 studies that explicitly addressed equity issues of EVs, said Wei Peng, assistant professor of international affairs and civil and environmental engineering, Peng added that the small percentage of papers that addressed equity was telling in itself.\"During that screening process, we began to learn what is overstudied and what is understudied,\" said Peng, who is also an associate of the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences. \"We highlighted in our paper what we saw as the most understudied: making equity more explicit as research and, second, we saw a need to focus on those emerging markets and parts of the developing world where EVs are going to be more important.\"Unlike vehicles powered by gasoline or diesel fuel, which produce carbon and other chemicals during the combustion process, the electric motors that drive the wheels of an EV do not produce tailpipe emissions. EV owners charge the batteries that are stored on board the EV, rather than add fuel.While driving electric vehicles may not emit carbon and other gases that could be harmful to people and the environment, there could be other economic and ecological costs that are not readily apparent, according to the researchers, who published their findings in Environmental Research Letters. For example, power plants that create the electricity to charge the vehicles may rely on systems that produce carbon. These plants may also be located long distances from where the electric vehicles are in use.The researchers added that the electric vehicles themselves require metals and materials that must be mined and manufactured. These materials are often transported through complex supply chains that stretch across the globe.\"As one example, electric cars are often seen as a positive step towards reducing air pollution in urban areas,\" said Peng. \"However, depending on how the electricity used to charge these cars is generated, it can have unintended consequences. If coal-fired power plants are used to generate the electricity for charging electric cars, then those living near these power plants may suffer from the transition to clean transportation. Additionally, the global supply chain challenges for electric vehicles, such as the need for batteries and steel, raise concerns that maybe we are just shifting emissions and other negative impacts to other countries.\"      Vulnerable populationsLittle work has been done to understand the makeup of populations that may be vulnerable to those impacts, the researchers report.\"One of the things we need to focus on are the effects for air pollution and, in particular, location specific factors,\" said Jinyu Shiwang, doctoral student in civil and environmental engineering. \"For example, there is the distribution of social demographic patterns that will influence the exposure and influence the environmental impacts.\"As an example, locations with more older people might be more vulnerable to the health impacts of air pollution compared to places with higher numbers of young people, Shiwang added.Technologies aimed at improving the environment\u2014often called \"clean tech\"\u2014are often viewed as universally beneficial. However, the study points toward the need to deeply probe all of possible effects\u2014positive and negative\u2014of these complex technological advances from the lens of equity, said Anna Lee, an undergraduate student in geosciences.\"There is an importance to understanding the intersection between environmental and social issues and also understanding how to better assess equity about the research in a policy setting,\" said Lee. \"As this study shows, equity is definitely a complex issue that involves better understanding the complex intersections between the transport of power and the manufacturing sector and how these equity implications can greatly differ depending on the geographical location, spatial scale and other social demographic factors.\"Peng, Shiwang and Lee worked with Anjali Sharma, the first author of the paper, who was a postdoctoral researcher in Peng's lab and is now an assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Technology.The team conducted the literature review by searching for peer-reviewed papers published in English between January 2010\u2014when EV technology began to rapidly emerge\u2014and August 2022. The researchers included papers that quantitatively assessed the distribution of at least one outcome of interest, such as emissions, pollution or health. They also included papers that studied the impacts across different population groups and locations. However, they excluded papers that did not perform a quantitative assessment of the distribution of emission and/or health impacts.The researchers suggest two areas for future work. First, more information is needed on the pollution and health impacts at a fine spatial scale, in addition to quantifying the impacts on emissions. There is also a need to understand the links between the transportation, power and manufacturing sectors to better understand the region-specific activities and impacts of the whole EV value chain.

  "text": "Kelvin waves, a potential precursor of El Ni\u00f1o conditions in the ocean, are rolling across the equatorial Pacific toward the coast of South America.          The most recent sea level data from the U.S.-European satellite Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich indicates early signs of a developing El Ni\u00f1o across the equatorial Pacific Ocean. The data shows Kelvin waves\u2014which are roughly 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) high at the ocean surface and hundreds of miles wide\u2014moving from west to east along the equator toward the west coast of South America.When they form at the equator, Kelvin waves bring warm water, which is associated with higher sea levels, from the western Pacific to the eastern Pacific. A series of Kelvin waves starting in spring is a well-known precursor to an El Ni\u00f1o, a periodic climate phenomenon that can affect weather patterns around the world. It is characterized by higher sea levels and warmer-than-average ocean temperatures along the western coasts of the Americas.Water expands as it warms, so sea levels tend to be higher in places with warmer water. El Ni\u00f1o is also associated with a weakening of the trade winds. The condition can bring cooler, wetter conditions to the U.S. Southwest and drought to countries in the western Pacific, such as Indonesia and Australia.This animation shows a series of waves, called Kelvin waves, moving warm water across the equatorial Pacific Ocean from west to east during March and April. The signals can be an early sign of a developing El Ni\u00f1o, and were detected by the Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich sea level satellite. Credit: NASA/JPL-CaltechThe Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich satellite data shown here covers the period between the beginning of March and the end of April 2023. By April 24, Kelvin waves had piled up warmer water and higher sea levels (shown in red and white) off the coasts of Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. Satellites like Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich can detect Kelvin waves with a radar altimeter, which uses microwave signals to measure the height of the ocean's surface. When an altimeter passes over areas that are warmer than others, the data will show higher sea levels.\"We'll be watching this El Ni\u00f1o like a hawk,\" said Josh Willis, Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. \"If it's a big one, the globe will see record warming, but here in the Southwest U.S. we could be looking at another wet winter, right on the heels of the soaking we got last winter.\"Both the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the World Meteorological Organization have recently reported increased chances that El Ni\u00f1o will develop by the end of the summer. Continued monitoring of ocean conditions in the Pacific by instruments and satellites such as Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich should help to clarify in the coming months how strong it could become.\"When we measure sea level from space using satellite altimeters, we know not only the shape and height of water, but also its movement, like Kelvin and other waves,\" said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, NASA program scientist and manager for Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich in Washington. \"Ocean waves slosh heat around the planet, bringing heat and moisture to our coasts and changing our weather.\" Provided byNASACitation:International sea level satellite spots early signs of El Ni\u00f1o (2023, May 15)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-international-sea-satellite-early-el.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "question_squad": " What was the name of the Swedish scientist who suggested that carbon dioxide buildup was happening?",
  "answer_squad": " Svante Arrhenius",
  "text": "We have grown so used to many things. To the pictures of wildfires and cremated animals, to the ice sheets calving into the ocean, to the promises of world leaders that they will heed the \"last chance\" warning of the scientists.          It's hard for anyone under the age of 40 to remember a time when carbon dioxide build-up, whether it was \"the greenhouse effect,\" or \"global warming\" or \"climate change\" or now \"climate crisis,\" wasn't in the news.The long hot summer of 1988\u201435 years ago\u2014is held as the moment that world leaders began to mouth the right pieties.Presidential candidate (and soon to be president) George H.W. Bush said he would use the \"White House effect\" to fix the Greenhouse Effect (he didn't). UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher warned of a giant experiment being conducted \"with the system of this planet itself.\"Thirty-five years. But it was actually 35 years before that\u2014fully 70 years ago this month\u2014that the danger of carbon dioxide build-up in the atmosphere first traveled around the world.That carbon dioxide trapped heat was uncontroversial. Irish scientist John Tyndall (possibly drawing on the work of an American, Eunice Foote) had shown that it did back in the mid-1800s.In 1895, Swedish Nobel prize winner Svante Arrhenius had suggested that\u2014over hundreds of years\u2014the build-up of carbon dioxide released when humans burn oil, coal and gas might trap so much heat as to melt the tundra and make freezing winters a thing of the past.His work was challenged, but the idea occasionally popped up in popular journals. In 1938 English steam engineer Guy Callendar suggested to the Royal Meteorological Society in London that warming was underway.But it was in early May, 1953, at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union, that Canadian physicist Gilbert Plass\u2014who had been corresponding with Callendar\u2014told the gathered scientists that trouble was afoot.Plass said that: \"The large increase in industrial activity during the present century is discharging so much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that the average temperature is rising at the rate of 1.5 degrees per century.\"      This got picked up by the Associated Press and other wire services and appeared in newspapers all around the world (even as far afield as the Sydney Morning Herald). Plass's warning also popped up in Newsweek on May 18 and in Time on May 25.The fact that the world was warming was already uncontroversial among scientists. But the emphatic connection with carbon dioxide made by Plass, as opposed to competing theories such as orbital wobbles or sunspot activity, was newsworthy.Plass had become interested in the question of carbon dioxide buildup while working for the Ford Motor Company. He looked at how carbon dioxide actually functions in the real world, not just at sea level (without getting too technical. Many scientists had dismissed Arrhenius's earlier work on the basis of false confidence that carbon dioxide worked the same there as in the stratosphere).Plass kept working on the issue, with technical and popular publications through the rest of the 1950s. In 1956, he had an academic article on \"the carbon dioxide theory of climate change\" published in the Swedish scientific journal Tellus, and also a popular article in the American Scientist. And he was present at the first major meetings to discuss carbon dioxide build up.Meanwhile, the carbon dioxide theory started getting more coverage among science journalists. One, George Wendt, wrote up the findings in the then well-regarded UNESCO Courier, and this got excerpted in the Irish Times in 1954, the same year that British journalists started mentioning it.In 1957 the then-new magazine New Scientist mentioned it. By the end of the 1950s, anyone who read a newspaper could have been aware of the basic idea.Throughout the 50s and 60s US, Swedish, German and Soviet scientists were examining the issue. In 1965 President Lyndon Johnson even namechecked carbon dioxide build-up in an address to Congress.By the end of the 1960s international collaboration was beginning, though there was caution still. For instance, in April 1969 the American scientist Charles Keeling, who had been measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations at a Hawaiian observatory, revealed that he had been asked to change the title of a lecture from, \"If carbon dioxide from fossil fuels is changing man's environment, what will we do about it?\" to \"Is carbon dioxide from fossil fuel changing man's environment?\"For climate historians like me, the 1970s are a fascinating period of intense measurement, modeling, observation and thinking which, by the end of the decade, produced a working consensus that there was serious trouble ahead. In effect, Plass had nailed it.When Plass spoke out, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide was at about 310 parts per million. Today, they're 423 or so. Every year, as we burn more oil, coal and gas, the concentration climbs and more heat is trapped.By the time Plass's warning is 100 years old, the concentrations will be much higher. There's a very good chance we will have gone over the 2\u00b0C warming level that used to be regarded as \"safe.\" Provided byThe Conversation  This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

  "text": "Be careful what you wish for. Britain's seesaw rainfall patterns that began last winter have continued, with an on-off pattern of dry and then wet months for many areas.          In the south of England, last year's drought was still affecting parts of the UK in early December, with stores of water in reservoirs and groundwater lower than usual. Seemingly endless rain followed over Christmas and January, before one of the driest Februaries on record led to renewed warnings of drought.Hydrologists like me were pointing to low stocks of water in aquifers and rivers, raising our eyebrows and sucking our teeth like car mechanics faced with a blown gasket. We need rain, we said, or reservoirs will dry up, crops will fail, and restrictions on how much water people can use, like hosepipe bans, may be necessary.Well, we got it. England and Wales had their wettest March in 40 years and April continued the wet trend, although rainfall was more patchy. The reason was that the jet stream, the fast-flowing and meandering air current high up in the atmosphere which governs a lot of weather in Britain and north-west Europe, shifted south. This pulled cold air down from the Arctic in early March.Much of Britain shivered under this blanket of cold, with snow and ice blocking roads and closing schools. Then westerly winds returned, pulling cyclonic weather systems off the ocean in a stream of wet weather.In April, the jet stream shifted north, leading to unsettled weather and lots of the April showers that we tend to expect of a British spring.The result is that the hydrology of England and Wales\u2014the state of the water supply in rocks, soils, rivers and reservoirs\u2014has bounced back. In some areas, it has bounced back so quickly that there have been floods. The heavy thunderstorms of recent days in parts of south-west England caused flash flooding of the kind that scientists expect to see more of as a result of the warmer atmosphere created by climate change.Parts of southern England now have higher levels of water in rivers and aquifers than we would expect at this time of year. Kent had almost twice the expected rainfall for April. Of course, this raises the risk of flooding\u2014and almost any part of the country can flood, especially from such sudden, intense downpours falling onto concreted urban areas or saturated ground.Scotland offers an interesting counterpoint. With only average rainfall over the past couple of months, parts of the country remain dry, with low river flows in the north heading into summer. Other regions look more normal for this time of year.      The European drought continuesThe drought has been broken in much of the UK. But other parts of western Europe, which the British Isles had been sharing dry conditions with, remain parched. Spain and Portugal are seriously water-stressed, as is southern France and northern Africa.As supermarket shoppers in the UK can attest, this has hit supplies of fresh fruit and vegetables in recent months. Spain's grain harvest, one of its key crops for many farmers, now appears threatened, with soils unable to sustain growth.The long-running drought across Europe means that some major rivers continue to have low flows. The Po in north Italy and the Rhine, the arteries of western European industry, are both still down on where they should be.When they are disrupted by flood or drought, big rivers that flow across international borders can heighten political and economic tensions. Low water levels in Europe have disrupted electricity supplies from normally reliable hydroelectric plants and some transport of materials and goods along the Rhine has had to shift to road and rail.As in Britain, the risk of sudden heavy rain can easily cause dangerous flooding, even while drought continues. Two people recently died in northern Italy when floods caused by exceptional downpours saw rivers swell dangerously. Yet, after months of dry conditions beforehand, the same region may still be in drought.El Ni\u00f1o returnsThe climate of the British isles has always been variable. Perhaps the last year indicates that it is now extremely variable. When we think of variable British weather, this usually means rain when you don't want it\u2014such as when you're trying to crown a king. But variable weather increasingly implies temperature.The summer of 2022 broke records for heat (temperatures in England topped 40\u00b0C for the first time). And we are now facing a situation in which El Ni\u00f1o\u2014the major pattern of ocean currents and temperatures in the equatorial Pacific\u2014is shifting into a positive, warming phase. This will likely mean that background global heating, which has continued to build up in the atmosphere and oceans, will return with gusto in the next year or two. The extremes are here to stay.

  "text": "A research team, composed of climatologists and an astronomer, have used an improved computer model to reproduce the cycle of ice ages (glacial periods) 1.6 to 1.2 million years ago. The results show that the glacial cycle was driven primarily by astronomical forces in quite a different way than it works in the modern age. These results will help us to better understand the past, present, and future of ice sheets and the Earth's climate.          Earth's orbit around the sun and its spin axis orientation change slowly over time, due to the pull of gravity from the sun, the moon, and other planets. These astronomical forces affect the environment on Earth due to changes in the distribution of sunlight and the contrast between the seasons. In particular, ice sheets are sensitive to these external forces resulting in a cycle between glacial and interglacial periods.The present-day glacial-interglacial cycle has a period of about 100,000 years. However, the glacial cycle in the early Pleistocene (about 800,000 years ago) switched more rapidly, with a cycle of about 40,000 years. It has been believed that astronomical external forces are responsible for this change, but the details of the mechanism have not been understood. In recent years, it has become possible to investigate in more detail the role of astronomical forces through the refinement of geological data and the development of theoretical research.A team led by Yasuto Watanabe at the University of Tokyo focused on the early Pleistocene Epoch from 1.6 to 1.2 million years ago using an improved climate computer model. Astronomical forces based on modern state-of-the-art theory are considered in these simulations. The large numerical simulations in this study reproduce well the glacial cycle of 40,000-year of the early Pleistocene as indicated by the geological record data.From analysis of these simulation results, the team has identified three facts about the mechanisms by which astronomical forces caused changes in climate in those times.The glacial cycle is determined by small differences in the amplitude of variation of the spin axis orientation and the orbit of the Earth. The timing of deglaciation is determined mainly by the position of the summer solstice on its orbit, which is at perihelion, not only by the effect of periodical change of the tilt of the Earth's axis. The timing of the change in the spin axis orientation and the position of the summer solstice on its orbit determines the duration of the interglacial period.\"As geological evidence from older times comes to light, it is becoming clear that the Earth had a different climatic regime than it does today. We must have a different understanding of the role of astronomical forcing in the distant past,\" says Takashi Ito from the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, a member of this research team who led the discussion on astronomical external forces.\"The numerical simulations performed in this study not only reproduce the Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycle well, but also successfully explain the complex effects of how astronomical forcing drove the cycle at that time. We can regard this work as a starting point for the study of glacial cycles beyond the present day Earth.\"The study is published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.

  "answer_squad": " rising sea levels",
  "text": "Anthropogenic factors on the West African coast are contributing more than global climate change to the rapid increase in vulnerability and flood risks in the region. This was demonstrated by an interdisciplinary IRD team, in collaboration with West African experts and the CNES, in a pilot quantification study published in Communications Earth & Environment.          The results of the study, part of the WACA-VAR interdisciplinary research program, highlight the need for regional and interdisciplinary coordination to address this issue.Rising sea levels are often assumed to be the main cause of vulnerability to West African coastal regions. However, according to this study, the anthropization of West African coasts, leading to increased vulnerability of the environment due to human activities and the intensification of socio-economic issues, will be an even more important factor in increasing the vulnerability to and the level of risk of flooding in these regions in the years to come.The researchers used cross-analysis of satellite data, particularly for sea levels, topographic data, and data reflecting predictions of social development to quantitatively establish the evolution of flood risks. They performed simulations projecting the impact of both factors to compare the impact of socio-economic factors with rising sea levels.The results showed that socio-economic development in coastal areas with rapid anthropization appears to be a much greater threat than rising sea levels for increasing flood risk on the West African coast.This sustainability science research also confirmed that the results can be applied to all West African countries, from Mauritania in the north-west to Cameroon in the south-east. The results point to the need for a coordinated action plan for the whole region that takes into account both environmental and socio-economic aspects. There is little doubt that no action would be more costly long term than a well-organized adaptation scheme. Key elements would be conservation of the coastal environment and reforms to socio-economic development. More information:Olusegun A.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the group that is trying to solve the PFAS problem?",
  "answer_squad": " UMaine PFAS+ Initiative",
  "text": "Rivers, lakes and oceans worldwide are home to trillions of pieces of plastic pollution that are smaller than five millimeters in length, known as microplastics, and their size allows them to easily enter humans and animals. Some can adsorb and transport other harmful toxicants that pollute waterways, including certain types of a more recently discovered set of toxic \"forever chemicals\" called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS.       There are thousands of types of PFAS in freshwater and saltwater bodies, and testing whether microplastics can absorb each one requires costly, time-consuming and labor-intensive testing. That's why a University of Maine-led team of researchers developed a new type of model for predicting whether any given kind of microplastic would adsorb any specific type of PFAS and at what concentration.Dilara Hatinoglu, a Ph.D. student in civil and environmental engineering, spearheaded the project in collaboration with Onur Apul, assistant professor of environmental engineering and her adviser, and Fran\u00e7ois Perreault, associate professor at the Arizona State University School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment.                Dilara Hatinoglu. Credit: University of Maine             Their models are applicable for fresh and saltwater and account for the type, size, shape and ionic charge of the microplastics; the functional compound groups and chain length of PFAS; and the salinity, pH level and natural organic matter that make up the solution chemistry of the water. In addition to minimizing the need for extensive lab testing, these models could assist with the development of new technologies and resources for PFAS removal.\"In water treatment plants, we use polymers that act as adsorbents, and they have the potential for removing PFAS from water. Our model can support the development of new adsorbent technologies,\" says Hatinoglu. \"We can modify sorbents depending on the outcomes and findings of our model because it gives an idea of what are the mechanisms and contributors of the adsorption mechanisms.\"For their research, the UMaine-led team trained its models to determine whether polystyrene microplastics would absorb 12 different chemicals, all of which are part of a subset of PFAS known as perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs). In addition to validating the efficacy of their models, which accounted for both fresh and saltwater, they also obtained several insights into the adsorption mechanisms between PFAS and polystyrene microplastics.      Among their findings were that polystyrene adsorbed greater concentrations of long chain PFAS than short chain ones, microplastics in saltwater adsorb more PFAS than those in freshwater, and the top contributing factors for whether a PFCA will be absorbed into a microplastic is the polarizability and hydrophobicity of the former. Their findings and other details about the model were published in the journal Science of The Total Environment.Researchers created their method for forecasting PFAS adsorption by microplastics through reconfiguring an existing type of model known as a linear solvation energy relationships (LSER)-based predictive model. Traditional LSER models are used for the adsorption mechanics between naturally-charged organic compounds, but PFAS are negatively-charged. Hatinoglu, Apul and Perreault are among the first researchers to apply LSER modeling to PFAS adsorption.Hatinoglu is building on her previous work by creating another model to predict the adsorbability of other pollutants into microplastics. The new model will factor in the extent of microplastic degradation.\"The interactions can be significantly affected if the plastics are degraded, so I would like to know more about the effect of degradation on adsorption,\" she says. \"That would be more realistic.\"The project led by Hatinoglu is part of a broader effort involving Apul, his students and colleagues, and researchers from Arizona State University to explore the interactions between microplastics and various chemicals.\"We are trying to pioneer academic knowledge. We are trying to lead the world and line up with the needs of the state. It's just a good position to be at,\" says Apul. \"We're making [cutting-edge] research in this field, trying to publish the first-evers of this discipline that happens to be at the forefront of Maine and national needs.\"Many UMaine researchers are working together on several PFAS research projects as part of the UMaine PFAS+ Initiative. Apul is science lead and a steering committee member for the university-wide initiative to focus on the emerging PFAS pollution crisis and its cascading environmental and societal impacts.\"We are trying to create a multidisciplinary, collaborative environment to tackle the PFAS problem. It's such a massive crisis, that a single discipline, a single person is not going to solve it,\" Apul says. \"There are so many different aspects, so we are trying to bring a multitude of talented researchers.

Then, seismologists theorized that they originated from controlled explosions in Poland, more than 140 kilometers (nearly 90 miles) to the south.On Monday, the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, an official body that monitors the underground, said the tremors were \"not caused by earthquakes, but by pressure waves from an event in the atmosphere.\" However, they came from \"an unknown source.\"\"The seismologists can report that it is unlikely that the tremors originate from a controlled explosion in Poland, which was carried out shortly before the first reports of tremors on Bornholm,\" the body known as GEUS said in a statement.On Saturday, GEUS said it had received \"more than 60\" tips from people on Bornholm that \"earthquake-like tremors\"\u2014described as a deep rumbling, shaking and rattling, changing pressure in the ear\u2014had been reported in the afternoon on Bornholm.No one was hurt. Police said they too were contacted by members of the public about the tremor on the eastern part of the island.

  "text": "Earlier this year, the US Environmental Protection Agency proposed maximum allowable levels in drinking water for six PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances)\u2014so-called forever chemicals. But the draft standards do not account for half of the PFAS at contaminated sites across the country.          The findings are from a team led by the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and are published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology.PFAS are present in fire retardant foams among other products and have been building up in the environment since they were first invented by Dupont in the 1930s and manufactured widely by 3M beginning in the 1950s. Exposures to some PFAS are linked to a range of health risks including cancer, immune suppression, diabetes, and low infant birth weight.PFAS compounds come in two forms: a precursor form and a terminal form. Most of the monitored PFAS compounds are terminal compounds. The EPA's draft drinking water rules are for six terminal compounds that do not degrade under normal environmental conditions. Precursor compounds can be transformed through biological or environmental processes into terminal forms. There are many precursor compounds, most of which are not routinely monitored, and none are currently regulated.The U.S. military is the largest global user of fire-retardant foams containing PFAS known as AFFF (aqueous film forming foam). For decades, hundreds of military bases across the U.S. and around the world used AFFF containing high levels of PFAS for fire training drills and fighting fires. AFFF use is one of the largest sources of PFAS contamination in drinking water.\"Many PFAS precursors present in AFFF are difficult to measure. This work shows that they are slowly transforming into PFAS of health concern at AFFF-contaminated sites and contributing to downstream contamination\" said Elsie Sunderland, Fred Kavli Professor of Environmental Chemistry and Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at SEAS and senior author on the new paper.Much of the PFAS at military sites consists of precursors that are omitted from standard analytical methods. Using a method previously developed in the Sunderland lab that captures all precursors in AFFF, the Harvard team modeled the expected duration and contribution of those precursors to groundwater contamination. The study finds that contamination of two of the newly regulated PFAS chemicals (perfluorohexane sulfonate: PFHxS and perfluorbutane sulfonate: PFBS) at one military base on Cape Cod, Massachusetts are sustained by microbial precursor biotransformation in the soil. These precursors are retained in the soil where they leach into groundwater in terminal form at concentrations thousands of times greater than the safe levels established by the EPA.      The researchers projected using a computer model and field data that, without remediation, widespread PFAS contamination of drinking water supplies near military facilities is likely to persist for centuries. Despite contamination of nearby aquifers that may already pose a risk to human health, the majority of PFAS are still sitting in the soils surrounding these contaminated sites, emphasizing the urgent need for advances in remediation technology that are effective at cleaning up both terminal and precursor compounds. Since regulations focus only on terminal compounds, the effectiveness of current remediation technologies at cleaning up precursors is not known.The researchers concluded that elevated PFAS exposures downstream of more than 300 U.S. military facilities that used the fire-fighting foams could similarly persist for centuries.\"The role of PFAS precursors in sustaining hazardous levels of contamination at Joint Base Cape Cod raises concern about whether exposure risks are underestimated near hundreds of other sites where they are not measured\" said Bridger Ruyle, the first author of the study and former doctoral student in Sunderland's Lab.The public comment period for EPA's draft PFAS drinking water regulation closes on May 30. While a step in the right direction, there are thousands of PFAS chemical structures, several hundred of which have already been detected in the environment, Sunderland notes.In related work also published in Environmental Science & Technology today, Sunderland's group also has shown that the number of military fire training areas within a watershed is a good predictor for PFAS contamination in a community's drinking water supply. But some groups are at higher risk than others; a forthcoming publication by the Sunderland lab documents marked sociodemographic disparities in exposures to PFAS and proximity to PFAS sources across the country.Additional authors include Colin Thackray and Chad Vecitis of Harvard; Craig Butt of AB Sciex LLC; and Denis LeBlanc and Andrea Tokranov of the U.S. Geological Survey.

  "text": "People who live in communities with higher proportions of Black and Hispanic/Latino residents are more likely to be exposed to harmful levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in their water supplies than people living in other communities, according to a new study led by researchers from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The researchers link this finding to the disproportionate siting of sources of PFAS pollution\u2014such as major manufacturers, airports, military bases, wastewater treatment plants, and landfills\u2014near watersheds serving these communities.          The study will be published online May 15, 2023, in Environmental Science & Technology.In March, the EPA proposed the first-ever national drinking water regulation for six PFAS, which it anticipates finalizing by the end of 2023. The regulation would establish maximum contaminant levels of two PFAS compounds, PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion (4 ng/L) and limit the other four. The public comment period ends on May 30.\"Our work suggests that the sociodemographic groups that are often stressed by other factors, including marginalization, racism, and poverty, are also more highly exposed to PFAS in drinking water,\" said first author Jahred Liddie, a Ph.D. student in population health sciences at Harvard Chan School. \"Environmental justice is a major emphasis of the current administration and this work shows it should be considered in the upcoming regulations for PFAS in drinking water.\"This is the first peer-reviewed study to show sociodemographic disparities in drinking water PFAS exposures and to statistically link sources such as landfills and airports to PFAS concentrations in community water systems over broad geographic scales.PFAS\u2014dubbed \"forever chemicals\" because of their extreme persistence in the environment due to their characteristic fluorine-carbon backbone\u2014are artificial compounds widely used for their stain-resistant and water-resistant properties. PFAS exposure has been associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.The researchers used PFAS monitoring data from 7,873 U.S. community water systems in the 18 states in which such data is widespread: California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Their analysis included 44,111 samples collected between January 2016 and August 2022. They also looked at the geographic locations of PFAS sources from multiple databases.The study found that PFAS detection was positively associated with the number of PFAS sources and proportions of people of color who are served by a water system. Each additional industrial facility, military fire training area, and airport in a community water system's watershed was associated with a 10%\u2212108% increase in perfluorooctanoic acid and a 20%\u221234% increase in perfluorooctane sulfonic acid in drinking water.According to the researchers, about 25% of the population in the 18 states considered in their study were served by community water systems that had levels of PFAS above 5 ng/L. Per this estimate, if the EPA's new proposed level of 4 ng/L is implemented, more than 25% of all Americans are likely to be considered exposed to dangerous levels of PFAS.\"Our findings are particularly concerning because past work on environmental disparities for other pollutants shows marginalized populations are susceptible to greater risks of adverse health outcomes compared to other populations, even at the same exposure levels,\" said senior author Elsie Sunderland, Fred Kavli Professor of Environmental Chemistry and professor of earth and planetary sciences at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and professor of environmental science and engineering in the Department of Environmental Health at Harvard Chan School. \"Regulating releases from PFAS sources and ensuring that people have safe drinking water is especially important in the most vulnerable communities to protect public health.\"Laurel Schaider at Silent Spring Institute was a co-author.

  "text": "From the outside, the Manhattan high-rise looks like any other luxury building: A doorman greets visitors in a lobby adorned with tapestry and marble.          Yet the basement has a set of equipment seen almost nowhere else in the world. To reduce emissions, the owners have installed twisting pipes and tanks that collect carbon dioxide from the building's massive, gas-fired boilers.The goal is to stop carbon dioxide, a climate-warming gas, from entering the atmosphere. In such a vertical city, it's impossible to address climate change without tackling emissions from buildings. So building owners must make dramatic cuts starting next year or face escalating fines under a new law which affects some 50,000 structures\u2014more than half the buildings in the city. Other cities such as Boston and Denver passed similar laws.To comply, some property managers are installing carbon capture systems, which strip out carbon dioxide, direct it into tanks and prepare it for sale to make carbonated beverages or soap. In this case, the carbon dioxide is sold to a concrete manufacturer in Brooklyn.\"Time is not on our side, and this type of solution can be installed quickly, cost-effectively and without a major disruption,\" said Brian Asparro, chief operating officer of CarbonQuest, which built the system.                A liquid carbon dioxide pipe is labeled in a production room of The Grand Tier luxury apartment building, where the carbon byproduct of a natural gas fired water boiler is repurposed for industrial sale, Tuesday, April 18, 2023, in New York.

Credit: AP Photo/John Minchillo             Critics say buildings should be switched to electricity instead.\"Carbon capture doesn't actually reduce emissions; it seeks to put them somewhere else,\" said Anthony Rogers-Wright, director of environmental justice at New York Lawyers for the Public Interest.It's unclear whether carbon capture will be recognized by New York City as a qualifying emissions reduction; the city has not decided.Capturing the culpritIn the Manhattan building's basement, two 500-horsepower boilers rumble, burning natural gas and releasing carbon dioxide. The boilers produce roughly half the building's emissions. The other half are generated at power plants where the building buys electricity. The carbon capture system, Asparro said, is trapping about 60% of the boilers' emissions.\"Boilers like this are installed everywhere, in schools and hospitals around the world,\" Asparro said.                Brian Asparro, chief operating officer of CarbonQuest, points to a delivery truck on a touch screen display outlining the process from which liquid carbon dioxide is produced as a byproduct of a natural gas fired water boiler in the basement of The Grand Tier luxury apartment building, Tuesday, April 18, 2023, in New York.

Credit: AP Photo/John Minchillo             Carbon dioxide and other gases flow from the boilers over a special material that separates out the carbon dioxide in a system that occupies two former parking spaces. Then it's compressed and cooled to minus-10 degrees Fahrenheit (minus-23 Celsius), turning it to liquid.Pipes lead to spigots outside the building, where a truck loads up with the liquefied CO2 and takes it to a concrete manufacturer in Brooklyn.The apartment building is trying to reduce energy in other ways, too, said Josh London, senior vice president at Glenwood Management Corp. It has computerized motors, fans and pumps, LED lighting and battery storage. The company plans to install carbon capture systems in five more buildings this year.Nearly 70% of New York City's large buildings have steam boilers like these that run on natural gas or oil, according to NYC Accelerator.The city law requires all buildings over 25,000 square feet to reduce emissions. In Minnesota, Radisson Blu Mall of America, a hotel, has installed a system that captures carbon dioxide that's eventually used to make soap.                A worker stands beside the mixing machines at the start of a production line creating concrete blocks designed with liquid carbon dioxide as an ingredient at the Glenwood Mason Supply Company, Tuesday, April 18, 2023, in the Brooklyn borough of New York.

Credit: AP Photo/John Minchillo             Mineralizing into concreteOver in Brooklyn, the floor shakes as yellow machines churn at Glenwood Mason Supply Company Inc., a concrete maker unrelated to Glenwood Management Corp. Grey concrete blocks rattle down a conveyor under a din of metal gears and motors.A truck arrives with liquefied carbon dioxide and then, using equipment provided by a company called CarbonCure, it's compressed and turned into a solid.As concrete ingredients churn, the carbon dioxide, now essentially dry ice, flows in like a mist. It reacts with calcium ions in cement, a main ingredients of concrete. This forms calcium carbonate, which becomes embedded in the concrete.Once carbon dioxide is in that mineral state, it's secure and it won't be released unless heated to about 900 degrees Celsius (1,652 degrees Fahrenheit), said Claire Nelson, a geochemist who specializes in carbon capture at Columbia Climate School.                Excess material from freshly made concrete blocks, created with liquid carbon dioxide as an ingredient, is collected for reprocessing at the Glenwood Mason Supply Company, Tuesday, April 18, 2023, in the Brooklyn borough of New York.

Credit: AP Photo/John Minchillo             \"So unless a volcano erupts on top of your concrete building, that carbon is going to be there forever,\" Nelson said.Adding mineralized carbon dioxide to concrete can reduce its carbon footprint, though not by much. On average, concrete producers using CarbonCure technology reduce their carbon footprint by 5% to 6%, said Robert Niven, CEO of CarbonCure. But that is still meaningful, because making concrete contributes significantly to climate change.Questions remainMany environmental groups remain skeptical of carbon capture, favoring investments in renewable energy. They also fear it could be unsafe to store carbon dioxide in a residential dwelling.After a carbon dioxide pipeline ruptured in Satartia, Mississippi, in 2020, 45 people sought medical attention at local hospitals, according to a report from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. People exposed to high concentrations of carbon dioxide, the report said, may experience rapid breathing, confusion, elevated blood pressure and increased arrhythmias. Extreme concentrations can lead to death by asphyxiation.

Credit: AP Photo/John Minchillo                 There's also a risk of leaks, if a truck transporting carbon dioxide gets into an accident, Rogers-Wright said.Proponents of carbon capture say there are safeguards and the technology installed in Manhattan was permitted by multiple city agencies.Nelson, the Columbia geochemist, who also started a carbon capture company, says storing natural gas in basements is more dangerous than storing carbon dioxide, and many people accept the risks posed by natural gas.The biggest challenge, proponents say, is scaling this and other solutions fast enough to make a difference in climate change.Back in Manhattan, the local utility doesn't have enough renewable energy to sell to all New York customers, and \"with solar, you need a bigger footprint than what we have in a building like this,\" London said. He wants to buy wind power when it's more widely available, but \"we can reduce our emissions while we wait,\" he said.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Inhabitants of Beledweyne town in Hiran region were forced out of their homes as heavy rainfall caused water levels to rise sharply, with residents carrying their belongings on top of their heads as they waded through flooded streets in search of refuge.\"Some 200,000 people are now displaced due to the Shabelle River flash floods in Beledweyne town and the number may increase anytime. It is a preliminary figure now,\" said Ali Osman Hussein, deputy governor for social affairs in Hiran region.\"We are doing all we can to help those who are affected,\" he told AFP.The region's deputy governor Hassan Ibrahim Abdulle said on Friday that \"three people were killed by the floods\".The disaster comes on the heels of a record drought that has left millions of Somalis on the brink of famine, with the troubled nation also battling an Islamist insurgency for decades.Residents told AFP they were forced to abandon their homes in the middle of the night earlier this week as water gushed through the streets and into buildings.Fartun Ali\u2014not her real name\u2014said it was her fifth time fleeing flash flooding in Beledweyne.\"Whenever the river breaks the banks, we flee,\" the 35-year-old mother of eight told AFP.                Inhabitants of Beledweyne town in Hiran region were forced out of their homes as heavy rainfall caused water levels to rise sharply.             Extreme weatherAnother resident Iman Badal Omar said he was relieved to escape with his life.\"All we could do was to evacuate and save our children. We did not take any of our belongings,\" he told AFP.East and central Africa often suffers from extreme weather during the rainy seasons.Earlier this month, 135 people were killed and more than 9,000 left homeless after heavy rains lashed Rwanda, triggering floods and landslides in several parts of the hilly nation.More than 400 people lost their lives due to torrential downpours, floods and landslides last week in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.Experts say extreme weather events are happening with increased frequency and intensity due to climate change\u2014and Africa, which contributes the least to global warming, is bearing the brunt.In May 2020, at least 65 people died in Rwanda as heavy rains pounded the region, while at least 194 deaths were reported in Kenya.At the end of 2019, at least 265 people died and tens of thousands were displaced during two months of relentless rainfall in several countries in East Africa.The extreme downpours affected close to two million people and washed away tens of thousands of livestock in Burundi, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Flooding in Somalia displaces 200,000 people: official (2023, May 14)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-somalia-displaces-people.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Rescuers on Monday evacuated about 1,000 people trapped by seawater 3.6 meters (12 feet) deep along western Myanmar's coast after a powerful cyclone injured hundreds and cut off communications. Six deaths were reported, but the true impact was not yet clear in one of Asia's least developed countries.          Strong winds injured more than 700 of about 20,000 people who were sheltering in sturdier buildings on the highlands of Sittwe township, such as monasteries, pagodas and schools, according to a leader of the Rakhine Youths Philanthropic Association in Sittwe. He asked not to be named due to fear of reprisals from the authorities in the military-run country.Seawater raced into more than 10 low-lying wards near the shore as Cyclone Mocha made landfall in Rakhine state Sunday afternoon, he said. Residents moved to roofs and higher floors, while the wind and storm surge prevented immediate rescue.\"After 4 p.m. yesterday, the storm weakened a bit, but the water did not fall back. Most of them sat on the roof and at the high places of their houses the whole night. The wind blew all night,\" the rescue group leader said.Water was still about 1.5 meters (5 feet) high in flooded areas later Monday, but rescues were being made as the wind calmed and the sun rose in the sky. He asked civil society organizations and authorities to send aid and help evacuate residents.

Several injuries were reported in neighboring Bangladesh, which was spared the predicted direct hit.Mocha made landfall near Sittwe township with winds blowing up to 209 kilometers (130 miles) per hour, Myanmar's Meteorological Department said. By midday Monday, it had weakened to a tropical depression, according to the India Meteorological Department.The State Administration Council issued disaster declarations for 17 townships in Rakhine state.High winds crumpled cell phone towers, but in videos collected by local media before communications were lost, deep water raced through streets and wind blew off roofs.Myanmar's military information office said the storm had damaged houses and electrical transformers in Sittwe, Kyaukpyu, and Gwa townships. It said roofs were torn off buildings on the Coco Islands, about 425 kilometers (264 miles) southwest of the country's largest city, Yangon.

At least 10 others were hospitalized, including two people who were listed in critical condition, said Tom Hushen, the emergency management coordinator for Cameron County. Many residents also suffered cuts and bruises.A nighttime curfew for those 17 and under was issued by Eddie Trevi\u00f1o Jr., the Cameron County judge, and is expected to end May 16 to \"mitigate the effects of this public health and safety emergency.\" The order also forbids non-residents of Laguna Heights from entering its residential areas.The tornado hit at about 4 a.m. as most people were in their homes asleep in the unincorporated community of Laguna Heights, located on the mainland across from South Padre Island, off the Gulf of Mexico. The county has among the highest poverty rates in Texas and is dotted with substandard housing.There was no advance warning. Instead, the first warning of a tornado \"went out at the same time it was touching ground,\" said Barry Goldsmith, a warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Brownsville.

  "text": "The 2019-2020 bushfire season was devastating. Vast areas of pristine forest burned, many for the first time in memory. By some estimates, a billion native animals died up and down Australia's east coast. Dozens of people died.          While Sydney's skies are blue again, Australia's Black Summer has kept scientists around the globe busy. The sheer size of these megafires produced startling effects. Recently, researchers found the huge volumes of smoke ate away at our protective ozone layer.Now, new research by American scientists suggests the Black Summer fires were massive enough to influence the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation cycle. It's one of the most important drivers of unusual weather over the entire globe\u2014and one which Australians know intimately.The three successive years of La Ni\u00f1a we just had? They could have been made more likely by the Black Summer fires. The reason, strangely enough, is the smoke.But it's important not to say the link is proven. While groundbreaking, this research relies on a single model. It's too early to clearly say bushfire smoke can trigger La Ni\u00f1a.Where there's fire, there's smokeWe've long known that the huge volume of ash blown high into the upper atmosphere by a big volcanic eruption can cool Earth's surface for many months, or even years.We also know volcanoes can influence the tropical Pacific, and thus affect whether an El Ni\u00f1o or a La Ni\u00f1a phase develops.How? By blocking light. Particles of ash reduce how much light gets to the surface.Volcanic ash gets blown high into the stratosphere, the part of the atmosphere just above the clouds where long-haul airplanes fly. Then, sunlight gets reflected before it reaches the ground, thus cooling the surface much like an umbrella can.                So much forest and scrub burned over the Black Summer that smoke plumes could be seen from space. Credit: NASA             Is bushfire smoke the same as volcanic ash?It's tempting to equate smoke with ash, and assume a large enough bushfire would have similar effects to a volcano.But there are important differences. Most obviously, a bushfire does not smell of rotten eggs.That might sound unimportant, but the rotten egg smell\u2014which comes from sulfur\u2014indicates major differences in the composition of volcanic ash and bushfire smoke.Different chemicals could mean very different responses to sunlight once in the atmosphere, which in turn could affect how much light is reflected.Second, bushfires don't explode.A decent volcano erupts with enough force to blast smoke high into the stratosphere. Bushfires don't have the same propulsive force.Bushfire smoke is hot, though, and hot smoke rises well. Some of the smoke from the Black Summer fires reached the stratosphere, although after a much longer interval than for volcanic eruptions.So, does a large bushfire have the same effect on climate as a volcano?The American researchers begin by checking the similarities using climate model simulations. They found bushfire smoke does indeed shade the surface from sunlight in these simulations.How much? Over a region of the south-eastern Pacific, about 150 terawatts of sunlight bounced back to space\u2014the equivalent of about 100,000 coal power plants.                Whiter, thicker clouds make the surface of the ocean cooler. Credit: Shutterstock             Clouds matterThe surprising finding is how it happens. In contrast to eruptions, bushfire smoke didn't reflect the sunlight directly. Instead, clouds were responsible.How does that work? This is where the magic of the climate system kicks in. Our atmosphere, oceans and lands are constantly interacting with each other.In their simulations, Black Summer smoke was first blown eastward by strong winds in the atmosphere. Under specific conditions, some smoke particles can interact with droplets in clouds and make clouds thicker and brighter. One region where this can happen is the subtropical south-eastern Pacific.The researchers were able to show the brightness of the clouds over this area increased considerably just around the time when the smoke particles arrived.These brighter, whiter clouds reflected more sunlight back into space and shaded the surface underneath. The net effect: cooler seawater.The effect was particularly important because of the timing. Smoke-whitened clouds emerged around our summer solstice in late December, which is the same time of year when the strength of the incoming sunlight peaks in the southern hemisphere.How is this linked to La Ni\u00f1a?Follow the chain: huge volumes of smoke blow east where they whiten clouds, cool the seawater, and cause less water to evaporate.Surface winds carried this cooler, drier air over the tropical Pacific, where it cooled the ocean surface again, and made it harder for tropical storms to form.A cooler sea surface in the tropical Pacific is a hallmark of La Ni\u00f1a, the cold phase of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation cycle.That's how this research was able to trace a link between Black Summer smoke and the rare back-to-back La Ni\u00f1a events in 2019-20 and 2020-21. As you know, we ended up having an even rarer triple La Ni\u00f1a in 2021-22, though the research period ends before this.                Smoke plumes reached as far as South America. Credit: NASA             Is the link now proven? Not quiteThis study offers a consistent physical explanation for how bushfires might influence the El Ni\u00f1o cycle.It's yet another example of how complex climate science can be, and how much we can still be surprised and challenged by what mother nature presents us.But there are a few caveats to keep in mind.For one, the ENSO cycle in the simulation was heading for a double La Ni\u00f1a even without the impact of the smoke. The simulation stops in the winter of 2021, which is before the real-world ENSO tipped into a third La Ni\u00f1a.What does that mean? In short, we can't know for sure if the effect of the bushfire smoke really did cause the triple La Ni\u00f1a.Another caveat is the fact the study relied on a single climate model, and relies heavily on the representation of clouds in that model.That's a potential problem, because we know clouds\u2014and especially their interactions with aerosols like smoke\u2014are still the largest source of uncertainties and model errors.To prove or disprove the link, we'll have to simulate the impact of ballooning Black Summer smoke plumes across many different models.

Paddocks that usually hold up to 1,000 cows sit empty and a haze of smoke has reduced visibility to less than five meters (16 feet).Fuchs and his son managed to evacuate his herd before the wildfires jumped a nearby river and arrived at his doorstep. Smoke now billows from piles of burnt trees on his wooded lot west of the provincial capital Edmonton.The blaze that threatened his farm was powerful, he told AFP. \"It's pretty scary stuff when fire's that close to your home.\"\"There're still hot spots and, you know, I don't think we're out of danger yet,\" he said, sporting a days-old beard and a cowboy hat. \"So I don't think we can let our guard down.\"Alberta is the largest cattle producing region in Canada, with almost five million head of cattle, according to government data.Dotted with open ranges and rolling plains in the shadow of the majestic Rocky Mountains, it has been used as a backdrop for Westerns such as Oscar winners Unforgiven and Brokeback Mountain.Over the past week, wildfires burnt more than 400,000 hectares (1,550 square miles), and forced almost 30,000 people out of their homes. Some 70 fires were still raging on Friday, including 20 listed as out of control.                BJ Fuchs seeks out embers on his property to stamp out after clearing brush and erecting fire barriers to slow the advancing fires.             \"It's going to be an ongoing battle, in my opinion, until we get a lot more rain, that's for sure,\" Fuchs said as he busily stomped out embers on his property.Fuchs and his neighbors despair over the hot, dry weather that has fueled the wildfires, only two years after a major drought slashed Western Canada crop yields by up to 40 percent.\"It's literally hundreds of thousands of animals that are potentially impacted because the hectarage (burnt) is so huge,\" Alberta Premier Danielle Smith told a news conference.'I felt hopeless'Hosing down barns and other farm buildings, erecting fire barriers and clearing tinder-dry brush, farmers and ranchers have been hard at work.\"I felt hopeless, wondering when it would end,\" said Jessee Crowther, who at 37 years old runs a small beef cattle farm. \"There's always something\u2014drought, hail, heavy rains\u2014you take what comes and keep on going.\"      This latest fire disaster\u2014which authorities suspect was started by a combination of lightning strikes and human carelessness\u2014has been \"crazy,\" he said.                BJ Fuchs' cows are now safe in new temporary digs -- away from fire danger.             In recent years, Western Canada has been hit repeatedly by extreme weather, the intensity and frequency of which have increased due to global warming.Forest fires in Canada's oil sands region in 2016 disrupted production and forced out 100,000 residents from Fort McMurray, pummeling the nation's economy.More recently in 2021, westernmost British Columbia province\u2014which neighbors Alberta\u2014suffered record-high temperatures over the summer that killed more than 500 people, as well as wildfires that destroyed an entire town, floods and mudslides.Over the past week, Alberta ranchers have scrambled to secure transportation to move cattle to fairgrounds and other locations that opened up emergency spaces for displaced livestock.\"Anybody that lives out here is prepared all the time,\" said farmer Trent Stanley, \"because if your house catches fire, the local fire department, you know, they're volunteer guys that are going to take half an hour to get to the station and then another half an hour to get here (and) by the time that happens, your house is gone.\"But in regards to livestock the situation is much more challenging\u2014even dire. \"I've got 850 cows calving.

  "text": "Polymer-based materials are almost everywhere, reaching even the deepest regions of the oceans, and their global production outpaces recycling, leading to the generation of tremendous amounts of water pollution with microplastics. These tiny polymer particles not only release chemicals but also reduce the number of bacteriophages.          Recently, researchers from the Institute of Physical Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, led by Prof. Jan Paczesny, explored this field, showing the scale of the problem. In their work, they studied the effects of microplastics on the infectivity of bacteriophages in an aqueous environment.It is challenging to imagine a world without plastic-based products. Synthetic materials are used in every field of life, from textiles, food packaging, and pharmacy, to materials used in the building industry. They are an indispensable part of life because of their multi-functionality. Plastics are lightweight, easily shaped, resistant to environmental conditions, and cheaper than many other synthetic materials, which makes them so popular.However, they are not necessarily friendly to health and the environment, especially as plastic particles get smaller. Getting to the water reservoirs, synthetic materials are easily mechanically fragmented into even smaller pieces. They can also undergo degradation under UV radiation, chemical degradation, or even biodegradation, so small plastic particles flow in the aqueous reservoirs for a very long time. Such microplastics with a diameter below 5 mm or smaller pieces like nanoplastic (even a million times smaller than microplastic) are everywhere, even in tap water or the milk of mammals.When these tiny plastic particles get into the environment, they become a serious problem for aquatic systems like lakes, rivers, seas, and even oceans, where they slowly decompose, releasing many harmful chemicals. Unfortunately, the list of them is quite long, starting from plasticizers, pigments, and flame retardants to even heavy metal ions that can cause many disorders or diseases. What is more, the surface of microplastic adsorbs organic compounds that work as food storage for microbial biofilms, leading to an imbalance between the particular groups of microorganisms forming biofilms, including bacteriophages.      Here, the science story begins. Recently, the team of Prof. Jan Paczesny from the Institute of Physical Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, demonstrated the effects of various microplastics on different types of bacteriophages in aqueous media. In their work, scientists used twelve different types of commonly used polymers, e.g., polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene (PE), PET, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polypropylene (PP), etc., cut them into tiny pieces, and used them as sources for all prepared materials.\"We judiciously chose industrial-grade polymers to reflect the real sources of microplastic in the environment. We prepared polymer samples by mechanically crumbling larger pieces of commercial-grade plastics. This process simulates how plastic fragments are created in the environment,\" says prof. Jan Paczesny.Sounds easy, right? In fact, the experiment is much more complicated to simulate the natural environmental conditions. Besides many features influencing the experiment, the commonly used leachates used as polymer additives play an important role. Researchers found a correlation between the decrease in bacteriophages on the microplastic's surface and the presence of particular leachates.Interestingly, the decrease in the number of phages on the surface of microplastic can undergo two different mechanisms. The first one relates to the presence of leachates that can deactivate even 50% of phages. The second one correlates with certain sizes of polymer materials, where the generation of nano- and sub-microparticles plays a key role and the adsorption results in phage scavenging.Prof. Paczesny says, \"The effect of leachables was measured upon exposure of phages not to particles themselves but to the buffer preincubated with microplastics. A double-overlay plaque counting method was used to assess phage titers. We employed a classical linear regression model to verify which physicochemical parameters (65 variables were tested) govern the decrease of phage titers.\"The research study focuses on the correlation between the number of phages and the physicochemical properties of microplastics as an introduction to the broad field of ecotoxicological studies. As only daily, the bacteriophages terminate up to 40% of bacterial biomass, they play a vital role in the maintenance of homeostasis in the bacterial community in all environments, from Big Blue to wastewaters. Once the microplastic gets into the environment, its surface hosts the biofilm layer, which is a booster for microorganisms to colonize, and here is the problem.Transported through the microplastics, many bacterial strains can colonize uncontrollably. As an effect, they can affect ecosystems in certain aquatic zones without the control of the phages, affecting not only animals but also humans. What does it mean in practice? Let's take a look at the seafood. Microplastic reaches the digestive tract of fish and other animals, disturbing the gut biota as well as forming aggregates in other tissues. Therefore, when we consume them, such microplastic gets into our digestive system, and with a decrease in the size of these polymer pieces, it can also aggregate in the body, which can lead to severe health issues. It sounds scary, but from the findings of scientists from IPC PAS, it is clearly seen that the growing pollution of the environment with microplastics can have a dramatic effect on global ecosystems.The work on the microplastic effect on phages is published in the Journal of Environmental Quality.More information:Enkhlin Ochirbat et al, Heteroaggregation of virions and microplastics reduces the number of active bacteriophages in aqueous environments, Journal of Environmental Quality (2023).

  "text": "Last summer, we traveled to the remote Arctic Hausgarten observatory area in the eastern Fram Strait (west of Svalbard, Norway) on a research ship. The samples we collected there included ice cores, sea water and ice algae from large packs of floating ice called ice floes. These form 1\u20132 meter thick \"plates\" of sea ice across the Arctic Ocean, some of which melt over the summer period.          Algae grow on the underside of these ice floes. Melosira arctica\u2014nicknamed \"snot\" due to its sticky, slimy and green nature\u2014is one of the major algae species in the Arctic Ocean. It is an essential organism both in the Arctic food web and for marine life overall.These ice algae provide nutrition for plankton and various other marine organisms in the Arctic. The algae also act as a conveyor belt of food for the organisms that live on the sea floor. As the ice melts, the algae detach and sink to the bottom where they are eaten by animals such as sea cucumbers and brittlestars.Ice algae are also a carbon sink, using CO\u2082 from the atmosphere and light energy from the sun to produce organic matter through photosynthesis\u2014a process known in ecology as \"primary production\". In 2012, these algae accounted for 45% of the Arctic's primary production.But now we've found that Arctic ice algae contain microplastics. This in itself may not be surprising: plastic has been found in every environment so far investigated on Earth. But the quantities we found were startling.We discovered an average of 31,000 microplastic particles per cubic meter of Melosira arctica\u2014a magnitude ten times higher than recorded in the surrounding water. Most of these particles were very small (less than 10 micrometers) and included many different types of plastic. The contamination of the ice algae could have major consequences for ecosystems and the climate.                How microplastics could become trapped in Arctic sea ice algae and sink to the seabed. Credit: Bergmann et al. (2023), CC BY-NC-ND An elevator to the seabed These particles may come from the surrounding sea water, the supporting sea ice (either trapped when the sea ice forms, or from the movement of liquid and particles through the ice as it melts), or from atmospheric microplastics that have been deposited on the ice and sea surface. While the process by which sea ice algae take in these microplastics is not yet well understood, it is clear they are highly effective at \"collecting\" these small plastic particles.In our earlier research, we were puzzled that the largest amount of microplastic on the Arctic seabed was always found underneath the sea ice melting zone along the ice edge, even in deep-sea sediment. The movement of Melosira clumps from the sea and ice surface to the seabed helps to explain why.The speed at which the algal clumps descend means they fall rapidly almost in a straight line below the edge of the ice. Other algae, which become \"marine snow\" (a term used for organic material that slowly drifts to the seafloor), fall much slower. These are often eaten as they descend and are also pushed sideways by currents, so sink to the seabed much further away from the ice edge.Why is it a problem? Melosira feeds essential Arctic seafloor and marine ecosystems. Its position at the bottom of the food chain means there is a risk of microplastics being passed upwards through the marine food web.                Ice algae sampling on an Arctic ice floe. Credit: Mario Hoppmann/Alfred Wegener Institute, CC BY-NC-ND This threat is particularly acute in the area we studied, as the Melosira sampled had collected even very small microplastics. Smaller microplastic particles are more likely to be transferred across cell membranes.Research finds that microplastics and their associated chemicals can alter the growth, function and breeding of marine species such as plankton and fish. It is extremely difficult to perform experiments on Arctic or deep-sea species because of the challenges associated with replicating their environmental conditions. However, one laboratory study found that microplastic exposure caused egg production rates to increase by up to eight times in Arctic zooplankton\u2014a response that is probably the result of stress.The impact of microplastic contamination on Melosira itself is not yet known. But it's possible that microplastics change Melosira's abundance, lifespan and health.Microplastics that are stuck to the outside of algae could lower photosynthetic rates by blocking out sunlight. And if particles enter the algal cells, then they could damage the parts of the cell where photosynthesis takes place (called chloroplasts) and therefore also impede this process. This could affect the export of carbon by Melosira from the air or sea to the seabed, and thus alter the processes underlying this important Arctic carbon sink.Arctic ice algae are collecting high quantities of microplastics\u2014a previously unknown hotspot. But our findings are likely just the \"tip of the iceberg\". They should accelerate conversations about the importance, and potential impact, of microplastics in Arctic sea ice algae on the ecosystems that these vital algae support.

  "text": "Installing urine collection systems in sub-Saharan city regions would make those conurbations more sustainable. This was demonstrated by a study by four researchers from CIRAD, IRD, Boubakar B\u00e2 University of Tillaberi (Niger) and Joseph Ki-Zerbo University, Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), published in the journal Regional Environmental Change.          For their study, the researchers analyzed nitrogen flows in waste in two sub-Saharan cities: Maradi (Niger) and Ouagadougou. The study was a first, and showed that urine was the main source of nitrogen losses. Collecting that urine could provide valuable fertilizer suitable for local agricultural use, and thus serve to make city region food systems more sustainable.Current urban development trajectories in sub-Saharan Africa are not sustainable. Fast-growing cities constitute nutrient sinks relying on nutrient-poor hinterlands. Those sinks, and the degradation and draining of nutrients in hinterlands, have significant environmental and health impacts. This runs counter to The UN Sustainable Development Goal 11, which aims to \"make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.\"To give the authorities a cross-sectoral view of a city's nutrient sink status, the researchers identified and analyzed a range of waste flows. Their approach distinguished four nested spatial levels: the urban area; the potential territorial recycling system; the country and the international level. Based on that analysis, the researchers focused on the origin and fate of those nutrient-containing waste flows.The method was applied to nitrogen in Maradi and Ouagadougou, to determine whether and to what extent those city regions could progress towards sustainable urban food systems. The fact of focusing on the nitrogen in waste rather than on waste flows themselves enabled a systemic understanding useful to the local authorities.The study showed that Maradi was a nitrogen sink, albeit at the heart of a still relatively sustainable urban food system. However, it could well evolve towards a situation similar to that of Ouagadougou: a large nitrogen sink with no significant city-hinterland recycling.Although of contrasting size, currently around 400,000 and 2,800,000 inhabitants respectively, these two cities evolve in highly similar biophysical, climatic, agricultural and socioeconomic settings. Their respective results may thus be considered an approximate illustration of a development trajectory.The study provided the first overview of waste-contained nitrogen flows in sub-Saharan cities. Existing reports so far provided only partial, sectoral assessments, focusing either on waste management, on sanitation, or on agriculture, while this study showed that nitrogen losses through sanitation and waste management largely exceeded other waste-contained nitrogen flows in these cities. Urine is therefore the main source of nitrogen loss.Urine collection initiatives to enable its use as a fertilizer would make urban systems more independent and resilient. This would improve regional food provision and reduce sanitation-induced urban water pollution, making urban systems more sustainable. The researchers consider that addressing the potential for urine recycling would be a worthwhile follow-up to this study.

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the new regulations proposed by the Biden administration?",
  "answer_squad": " The new regulations",
  "text": "On May 11, 2023, the Biden administration proposed new regulations to curb carbon pollution from existing power plants. The new rules replace the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, which was proposed in 2015 but ran into multiple legal challenges and never took effect. Nonetheless, in a high-profile 2022 ruling, West Virginia v. EPA, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the Obama administration's approach exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate power plant carbon pollution under the Clean Air Act.          Jennifer K. Rushlow, dean of the Vermont School for the Environment and a law professor at Vermont Law & Graduate School, explains how the new regulations are designed and the delicate balance they attempt to strike between slowing climate change and avoiding further legal setbacks.1. How has the Biden administration tailored these regulations in response to the West Virginia v. EPA ruling?The scent of West Virginia v. EPA is all over the new proposed rules. How could it not be? The Supreme Court accused the Environmental Protection Agency of attempting a \"wholesale restructure\" of the nation's energy mix because the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan essentially required existing fossil fuel power plants to either use cleaner fuels or close.The new proposed regulations attempt to thread the needle between meeting the Biden administration's climate commitments and avoiding another gutting in court. To do that, they focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from individual power plants with on-site technologies, instead of requiring a large-scale shift from fossil fuels to renewables.The rules rely on ambitious and relatively new emissions reduction technologies, like carbon capture and storage, or CCS, and low-carbon hydrogen fuel. The EPA proposes to use CCS to reduce emissions from large coal plants with long life expectancies. For large natural-gas-fueled power plants that provide baseload power\u2014meaning that they run continuously\u2014the agency proposes at least partial replacement of natural gas with hydrogen fuel.2. Do the draft rules indicate that EPA is responding to energy industry critiques of the Clean Power Plan?There are a variety of strategies built into EPA's approach in the new rules that I believe aim to secure buy-in from fossil fuel interests and mitigate against conservative backlash. The proposal takes a tiered and staggered approach to which power plants will be regulated, how stringently, and by when.First, the EPA goes out of its way to accommodate coal plants that are already scheduled to close or anticipate shutting down in the next couple of decades. It proposes much less stringent standards for these plants, since they will not be able to spread the cost of adopting new controls over many years of operation. Since the regulations are so light for those facilities, and the plants are already closing due to other economic factors, it will be hard to blame these rules for the loss of coal plants.Along the same rationale, the EPA is only regulating baseload natural gas plants right now and leaving regulations for smaller plants and peaker plants\u2014those that run only during peak demand periods\u2014for another day.Second, the rule's reliance on carbon capture and storage, in my view, ought to be music to fossil fuel companies' ears. CCS has long been their preferred climate mitigation tool because it is one of the only means of reducing carbon emissions that does not hamper the continued extraction and combustion of fossil fuels.Even better from their perspective, the captured carbon effluent can be injected into geological formations for underground storage and actually flush out buried crude oil that would otherwise be unreachable\u2014meaning even more oil production.This video, which aired several months before the West Virginia v. EPA ruling, examines West Virginia\u2019s opposition to broad curbs on power plant carbon emissions.The EPA solicits very specific comments in these regulations from interested parties, like the energy industry, on questions such as the time frame required to implement a particular technology and what size facilities should be subject to which standards. In addition to genuinely wanting to get the rules right, this deferential approach may be designed to build an administrative record that can withstand judicial scrutiny when the agency is inevitably sued. If the regulated community provides feedback on those items, and the final rule shows that the agency was responsive to that feedback, it will be harder for a court to find that compliance with the rule is not feasible.      3. Do you see legal vulnerabilities in the proposed new rules?The EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants is derived from the Clean Air Act, which requires the agency to set emissions limits using a standard that reflects the \"best system of emission reduction\" that has been \"adequately demonstrated,\" taking into account cost and other factors.For coal plants, the agency identifies carbon capture and storage as the \"best system of emission reduction.\" The draft rule states that CCS has been \"adequately demonstrated\"\u2014meaning that some plants are using it\u2014and that the cost is manageable, thanks to tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act.This reasoning is a little thin. CCS is an emerging technology that's not yet widely used, in part because it is so expensive. In fact, the EPA could point to only a handful of existing projects to show that the technology has been \"adequately demonstrated.\"However, regulated coal plants won't necessarily be required to use CCS itself. Rather, they will be required to reduce their emissions to a level that could be achieved using CCS. If they can find other means, they are welcome to use them. But since CCS is expensive and not yet widely used, some observers speculate that the new rules will cause coal plants to shut down or switch to cleaner fuels, as the Clean Power Plan required.This is not a topic that the EPA wants to revisit with the Supreme Court. However, if the court's conservative majority sticks to its avowed preference for \"textualist\" interpretations of the law, the proposed regulations provide plenty of room for the court to find in the administration's favor, on the basis that the new rules stick to much more familiar territory within the Clean Air Act than the Clean Power Plan did.4. How do these regulations conform with Biden's focus on environmental justice?In addition to greenhouse gases, fossil fuel power plants emit deadly air pollutants that contribute to thousands of deaths every year. And they disproportionately harm the health of nearby low-income communities and communities of color.Carbon capture and storage doesn't reduce these pollutants at any significant scale, nor does it prevent public health, environmental and cultural damage caused by fossil fuel extraction projects. As a result, some communities view CCS as incompatible with environmental justice principles.Some of these criticisms surfaced last year, when the White House developed guidance on CCS. For example, the Indigenous Environmental Network\u2014a grassroots coalition of Indigenous peoples and tribal governments\u2014delivered scathing comments that CCS perpetuates fossil fuel extraction and combustion that harm Indigenous communities.These draft rules may widen the rift between traditional environmentalists, some of whom prioritize curbing climate change at all costs, and environmental justice community advocates who face immediate harm from fossil fuel power plants, as well as mounting and disproportionate impacts from climate change.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards PFAS in cosmetics and personal care products?",
  "answer_race": " Critical.",
  "question_squad": " What is the threshold level for PFAS in cosmetics and personal care products?",
  "answer_squad": " one microgram per gram",
  "text": "Cosmetics and personal care products enhance the way we look and feel. During the pandemic, I started a self-care facial routine. It helped me cope with lockdown orders, while simultaneously adjusting to my new identity as a mom. I applied toner, serum and cream to brighten mornings and relax evenings.          But many of these products contain chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as 'forever chemicals.' They are used as ingredients that can make products waterproof, long-lasting and help them spread smoothly across skin.European data indicates there are about 170 PFAS ingredients for use in cosmetics and personal care products. Each year, upwards of 80,000 kg of PFAS may be released after product use to wastewater and solid waste streams, a significant source of PFAS to the environment.Persistent contaminantsPFAS are persistent environmental contaminants. The properties that make them commercially useful, particularly their stability, also means that there is no environmental mechanism to degrade them, and so they accumulate. PFAS have been found across the globe, including remote regions like the Arctic.PFAS also accumulate in the body. The Canadian Health Measures survey sampled blood from thousands of people and found several PFAS in all participants.Major sources of PFAS exposure to people are through diet, from drinking contaminated water or ingesting food, such as fish or meat. Agricultural fields can contain PFAS from biosolids used as fertilizer, as wastewater treatment plants cannot remove them.Therefore, PFAS are transported via biosolids to crops and animals. Similarly, PFAS are added to personal care products, applied, then washed off to enter wastewater treatment plants, contributing to a global environmental problem.PFAS in personal care productsIn our study, we measured PFAS in cosmetics and personal care products purchased in Canada. Products included bronzers, concealers, foundations, shaving creams, sunscreens and moisturizers.PFAS were extracted from each product and measured using mass spectrometry instrumentation. These instruments identify individual PFAS present in the products, at high milligram amounts or down to a trillionth of a gram.Particularly high levels stemmed from products containing the following ingredients: C6-16 perfluoroalkyl ethyl phosphates, perfluorooctyl triethoxysilane, and perfluorobutyl ethers. The Canadian government has prohibited some PFAS from products, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and any chemical that degrades to produce PFOA.New proposed Canadian PFAS regulations will set a threshold level at one microgram per gram in products. This means that PFAS at or below this level would be incidental and the prohibition would not apply. Yet we found that some products contained PFAS\u2014including those prohibited from use\u2014at levels a thousand times higher than the incidental level\u2014pointing towards a lack of oversight when it comes to managing PFAS in the personal care product industry.      Higher PFAS levelsEpidemiological studies are showing that PFAS levels in the body are related to regular use of cosmetic and personal care products. One study in the United States noted higher blood levels of PFAS in women that typically wore foundation. A study from Korea linked application of cosmetics and personal care products to higher PFAS levels in breast milk.Another study illustrated this trend more directly. PFOA was purposefully added to a sunscreen to determine whether blood levels in one person would increase after application. Within three weeks, the PFOA from the sunscreen application equaled about 10 percent of the total amount of PFOA in his body. This suggests that the daily application of a PFAS-containing sunscreen during summer months\u2014and frequent application of other PFAS-containing cosmetics and personal care products\u2014would result in high blood levels.Unlike other chemicals, certain PFAS like PFOA are persistent. This means that human exposure to even low amounts of PFAS can accumulate over time. The half-life of PFOA in humans is about two years.Even after this point, half the amount of PFOA remains and it takes even more years for it to be eliminated. However, continuous exposure from multiple sources, including the use of cosmetics and personal care products, guarantee that PFOA and similar PFAS, are never eliminated.Health implicationsIn Canada, the PFAS frequently measured in the environment with adverse health implications are prohibited from use. These include PFOA and PFOS, long-chain PFCAs, and any compound that degrades to produce them. This is a broader regulatory approach compared to other regions, including the U.S., which restricts individual PFAS.But other regions are taking an even broader approach. The European Union's proposed ban would eliminate thousands of PFAS. California is planning to effectively eliminate any PFAS ingredient used in cosmetics and apparel by 2025.Canada should consider a similar approach, as a solution to protect people from exposure to these chemicals when applying cosmetics and personal care products, and eliminate their transfer to the environment after use.Regulation and informationThere is a solution: ban PFAS from cosmetics and personal care products. Some cosmetic retailers like Sephora do not include PFAS on their \"clean\" cosmetic lists so that consumers can avoid their use. But PFAS-containing cosmetics and personal care products are still readily available to Canadians.PFAS are absent from the Canadian Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist, the list that contains ingredients prohibited from use in cosmetics and personal care products sold in Canada.Environmental groups, managers, and industry should work together to stop using PFAS in cosmetics and personal care products, and instead use other ingredients that serve the same purpose.At the very least, people should be aware of the PFAS in these products through clear labeling so that they can make informed decisions. Since completing this study, I have screened the ingredients in my products, only to find that a couple contained PFAS. I switched to other products.

  "text": "Ocean motion plays a key role in the Earth's energy and climate systems. In recent decades, ocean science has made great strides in providing general estimates of large-scale ocean motion. However, there are still many dynamic mechanisms that are not fully understood or resolved.          Prof. Su Fenzhen's team at the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and their collaborators found that humans know less than 5% of the ocean currents at depths of 1,000 meters below the sea surface, with important implications for modeled predictions of climate change and carbon sequestration.Their findings were published in Nature Communications.The researchers used a displacement dataset of 842,421 observations produced from Argo floats from 2001 to 2020. Lagrangian velocities were computed near 1,000-meter depth, and several accuracy indicators were used to compare Argo float velocities with simulated values from global circulation models.Results showed that only 3.8% of the mid-depth oceans can be considered as accurately modeled.\"An important finding that circulation energy in almost all of the world's oceans is underestimated. This is probably due to the poor resolution of high-frequency dynamics in ocean circulation models and the inadequacy of current solutions to sub-grid processes,\" said Prof. Su.\"In the future, we expect to develop ocean circulation models that could more faithfully represent observed ocean currents through more intensive and qualified observations, more productive parameterization, finer model resolution, and in-depth theoretical analysis,\" he said.The study highlights the nature and extent of the mismatch between scientific knowledge and the actual ocean environment. It can help guide recommendations for more intensive observational and more accurate predictions to reduce the large and significant biases between models and observations.

  "text": "Authorities in Bangladesh and Myanmar prepared to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people Friday, warning them to stay away from coastal areas as a severe cyclone churned in the Bay of Bengal.          Cyclone Mocha is expected to hit land on Sunday with wind speeds of up to 160 kilometers (100 miles) per hour and gusts up to 175 kph (110 mph) between Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh and Kyaukpyu in Myanmar, India's Meteorological Department said.Bangladesh, a delta nation with more than 160 million people, is prone to natural disasters such as floods and cyclones. The evacuation of nearly 500,000 people is expected to start Saturday with 576 cyclone shelters ready to provide refuge to those who are moved from their homes along the coast, said Bangladesh government administrator Muhammad Shaheen Imran.The International Rescue Committee said in a statement the cyclone posed a threat to Rohingya refugees who fled from neighboring Myanmar and are living in camps in Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh.\"Still reeling from a devastating fire in March that destroyed more than 2,600 shelters and critical infrastructure, over 850,000 refugees risk losing their homes and livelihoods,\" the statement said.The committee said it was scaling up its emergency response by deploying mobile medical teams to offer services to vulnerable groups such as women, girls, the elderly, and people with disabilities. The IRC is a global humanitarian aid, relief and development nongovernmental organization.\"This is the first cyclone system in the north Indian Ocean this year,\" said Rajendra Kumar Jenamani, a senior scientist at the Indian Meteorological Department. \"The cyclone is severe and will likely affect millions of fishers and coastal communities in Bangladesh and Myanmar.\"In May 2008, Cyclone Nargis hit Myanmar with a storm surge that devastated populated areas around the Irrawaddy River delta. At least 138,000 people died and tens of thousands of homes and other buildings were washed away.Myanmar authorities warned of possible flash floods and landslides in coastal areas as residents stocked up on essential supplies, said Hla Tun, a director at the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology.Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune city, said cyclones in the Bay of Bengal are becoming more intense more quickly, in part because of climate change.The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported that emergency response exercises were being conducted in various regions. It said thousands of people living along the western coast of Rakhine state where the storm is expected to pass are being evacuated.In Bangladesh, control rooms in cyclone-prone areas were ready for emergency support. Three ports were put on alert, Imran said.He said the government has allocated dry food, rice and cash and organized thousands of volunteers for relief work under the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society.Cyclone Mocha is expected to hit coastal districts including Chattogram, Cox's Bazar, Noakhali and Bhola in Bangladesh on Sunday.India's Meteorological Department said the storm was centered more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) southwest of Cox's Bazar and 930 kilometers (580 miles) southwest of Sittwe in Myanmar on Friday and was moving northward at 9 kph (5 mph).Fishermen and ships were advised not to venture into the southeastern Bay of Bengal and northern Andaman Sea, it said.The department said it was expecting heavy to very heavy rainfall in Andaman and Nicobar Islands and parts of India's remote northeast.Climate scientists say cyclones can now retain their energy for many days, such as Cyclone Amphan in eastern India in 2020 which continued to travel over land as a strong cyclone and caused extensive devastation. \"As long as oceans are warm and winds are favorable, cyclones will retain their intensity for a longer period,\" Koll said.Cyclones are among the most devastating natural disasters in the world, especially if they affect densely populated coastal regions in South Asia.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the watershed that was studied by researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst?",
  "answer_squad": " Sudbury-Assabet and Concord watershed",
  "text": "Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst recently published a study in the journal PLOS Water that focuses on the Sudbury-Assabet and Concord watershed in eastern Massachusetts, and which links hydrological changes, including floods, drought and runoff, to changing patterns of land use.          \"We all live in a watershed\" says Timothy Randhir, professor of environmental conservation at UMass Amherst and the paper's senior author. \"We're constantly modifying our landscape, turning what were once forests into roads, parking lots and backyards. We're changing the landscape from one that was once hydrologically resilient to one that pushes water downstream.\"But it can be hard to see the complex links between changes in land use and changes in the hydrological cycle. For instance, much of Massachusetts is now subject to the paradoxical situation in which summer drought follows spring flooding. Surely if there's enough extra water to flood the streets in towns throughout the state then there should be plenty of groundwater left for drinking, lawn watering and maintaining the levels of streams and lakes?This is where thinking like a watershed comes in. \"Every drop of rain has two pathways when it falls,\" says Randhir. \"It can either run off the land into a stream, or it can infiltrate the soil and slowly trickle down to the water table.\"But by paving over large swaths of land, burying swamps and wetlands and channelizing rivers, we have made it far more difficult for rain to infiltrate the soil, increasing the likelihood of drought. At the same time, all that runoff pours into streams and rivers, which in turn grows into a deluge as it thunders downstream, fed by even more runoff as it progresses.To make the links between land use and hydrological effect visible, and to project these effects into the future, Randhir and his graduate student, first author Ammara Talib, focused on the Sudbury-Assabet and Concord watershed in eastern Massachusetts, an area that incorporates both rural areas and suburbs of Boston.The pair fed historical data describing the changing land-use into a model which projected the trends for the years 2035, 2065 and 2100. The team then fed the results of the land-use model into a hydological model called the Hydrological Simulation Program-FORTRAN.What they found was that, by 2100, the total forested area will decrease by 51% and impervious areas (roads and parking lots) will increase 75%. These changes will increase annual stream flow by 3%, while runoff will grow by a whopping 69% annually. All this increased runoff will mean more topsoil and other solids in the water (an increase of 54%), and 12% and 13% increases in phosphorous and nitrogen concentrations, respectively.But none of this need happen.\"We can plan for the future on the watershed scale,\" says Randhir, by urban planning that implements best practices for sustainable and site-specific land-use measures. These can include creating rain gardens, using permeable pavement in large parking lots and employing vegetated swales to slow the runoff.\"The watershed is a signature of the health of the landscape,\" says Randhir. \"The quality of life in any particular landscape depends on how the watershed is functioning.\" More information:Ammara Talib et al, Long-term effects of land-use change on water resources in urbanizing watersheds, PLOS Water (2023).

  "answer_squad": " SWRO",
  "text": "Treating seawater with selected chemicals before desalination could reduce biofouling and lengthen the lifespan of filtration membranes. Identifying the components of membrane antiscalants that cause biofouling could help make seawater desalination a more sustainable source of fresh water.          \"Safe drinking water is a human right,\" says environmental scientist Graciela Gonzalez-Gil, \"yet roughly 800 million people have no access.\" The United Nations estimates that demand for fresh water could exceed the natural water cycle supply by as much as 40% by 2030.\"Seawater desalination\u2014particularly by reverse osmosis (SWRO), which involves pressurizing seawater through a membrane at high pressure to remove salt and impurities\u2014has become a widely adopted low-cost source of drinking water in arid coastal countries,\" says Gonzalez-Gil's colleague and KAUST alumni Ratul Das, who now works as Head of Desalination R&D for energy company ACWA Power, which has 16 water seawater desalination plants across four countries.However, SWRO is energy intensive, and the used membranes create a lot of waste. Seawater is typically pretreated with antiscalants to prevent the scaling of salt on the membranes. \"The low cost of these chemicals compared to other methods helps keep water prices low, hence their popularity,\" says Das. But many of them trigger fouling by promoting microbial growth.\"Desalination operators are not fully informed about why and to what extent antiscalants cause biofouling,\" says Gonzalez-Gil. \"Measuring the bacterial growth caused by different antiscalants and linking this to their chemical composition can help these operators select products with minimal biofouling.\"Gonzalez-Gil's team prepared vials of natural seawater with a small starting concentration of indigenous bacteria. Adding one of eight common antiscalants to separate vials, they measured daily bacterial growth and compared this to bacterial growth in seawater without antiscalant.\"We measured the carbon, phosphorous and nitrogen content of each antiscalant and used nuclear magnetic resonance to get a more detailed chemical fingerprint,\" says Gonzalez-Gil.The team found that some antiscalants contained other compounds besides the active ingredients. One particular contaminant\u2014orthophosphate\u2014clearly promoted bacterial growth. \"Surprisingly, not all phosphanate-based antiscalants were contaminated with orthophosphates,\" says Gonzalez-Gil, \"such as HEDP (1-hydroxyethylidene-(1,1-diphosphonic acid), which was also the only antiscalant that didn't promote bacterial growth.\"The team's chemical fingerprinting technique could help manufacturers tailor antiscalants to contain fewer bacteria-boosting compounds. \"Reducing biofouling will reduce the energy required for SWRO,\" says Das. \"It will lower the costs of desalination and, by reducing greenhouse emissions, will help to protect the planet.\"Reverse osmosis membranes are currently replaced every three to five years, despite a potential lifespan of 10 to 15 years. \"Minimizing biofouling will extend their useful life and reduce the membrane waste deposited to landfill,\" adds Gonzales-Gil.Das hopes to develop a simple low-tech test for use at desalination plants worldwide. \"We want to eliminate 'black boxes' in the desalination industry and drive greener initiatives that have impact for Saudi Arabia and internationally,\" he adds.

  "answer_squad": " optically stimulated luminescence dating",
  "text": "Knowing how the frequency and intensity of wildfires has changed over time offers scientists a glimpse into Earth's past landscapes, as well as an understanding of future climate change impacts. To reconstruct fire records, researchers rely heavily on sediment records from lake beds, but this means that fire histories from arid regions are often overlooked. Now, a new study shows that sand dunes can serve as repositories of fire history and aid in expanding scientific understanding of fire regimes around the world.          Published May 11 in Quaternary Research, the study is the first to examine sedimentary records preserved in foot-slope deposits of sand dunes. The research team, led by Nicholas Patton, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher now at DRI, studied four sand dunes at the Cooloola Sand Mass in Australia. Australia is one of the world's most fire-prone landscapes, with a long history of both natural and cultural burning, and vast expanses without lakes or ponds to gather sedimentary records from.The researchers aimed to prove that these sand dune deposits could be used to reconstruct reliable, multi-millennial fire histories. These previously unrecognized archives could potentially be used in arid regions around the world to fill knowledge gaps in places where fire shapes the landscape.\"Many fire and paleoclimate records are located where there's a lot of water bodies such as lakes, peats, and bogs,\" Patton says. \"And because of this, most global models really have a bias towards temperate regions.\"The Cooloola Sand Mass consists of enormous\u2014up to 240-meter-tall\u2014sand dunes that build up at the coast and gradually shift inland from the power of the wind. By identifying the age of the dunes using a technique called optically stimulated luminescence dating, or OSL, Patton's team found that the four dunes span the Holocene, representing the last approximately 12,000 years.Once a dune is stable, meaning it is no longer growing but slowly degrading, the force of gravity acts on the dune slopes to collect falling sand at the base, along with the remnants of charcoal from local fires that deposited on the dune's surface. This sediment builds up over time, layering charcoal from fire events that can be reliably identified using radiocarbon dating.\"We were digging soil pits at the base of the dunes and were seeing a lot of charcoal\u2014more charcoal than we expected,\" says Patton. \"And we thought maybe we could utilize these deposits to reconstruct local fires within the area.\"                An illustration showing how charcoal layers accumulate in dune foot-slope deposits. Credit: Nicholas Patton/DRI             Patton found that on the younger dunes (at 500 years old and 2,000 years old), charcoal layers represented individual fires, because the steep slope of the dunes quickly buried each layer. However, the older dunes (at 5,000 years old and 10,000 years old) had more gradual slopes that blended charcoal from different fires over time, providing a better understanding of periods of increased or decreased fire frequency.The dunes offered localized fire histories from within an approximate 100-meter radius, so fire records vary somewhat among the four dunes, which spanned approximately 2 kilometers. However, Patton's team compared their results to other fire records from the region found in lake and swamp deposits. Similar to the regional records, their findings showed three major periods of fire activity over the past 7,000 years.The researchers write that similar records are likely held in sand dunes around the world, and that regions like California and the Southwest U.S. could benefit from a better understanding of regional fire history. Embedded within the fire records is not only information about natural wildfires, but also the way that humans influenced fire regimes.\"Fire histories are important for understanding how fire was used in the past for cultural purposes, whether that was to clear fields for agriculture or for hunting,\" Patton says.Patton hopes to continue this line of research at other dunes near the Cooloola Sand Mass that are nearly 1 million years old to obtain a long-term fire history for the region. Because Australia has had human communities for at least 60-70 thousand years, and quite possibly longer, these records could help understand the relationship between humans and historical fire regimes.\"These kinds of long-term records aren't always available within lake sediments, but they might be available within these dune deposits,\" Patton says. \"That's pretty exciting.\" More information:Nicholas R.

The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) are useful products for scientists to understand how things like tree canopy and road coverage changes over time, but something as simple as cloud coverage can be misinterpreted in the satellite images as a significant surface coverage change. How can researchers be sure they're getting a truly representative understanding of any one area?          The answer lies in composite images\u2014for which researchers with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the University of Connecticut have developed a new strategy to produce clean images.They published their approach in the Journal of Remote Sensing\"Our goal was to produce clean Landsat\u2014the satellite program that monitors Earth's surface for natural and human-caused changes\u2014images without clouds and cloud shadows,\" said corresponding author Suming Jin, physical scientist with USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center. \"We need consistent and clean Landsat images without any gaps to help prepare for large operational applications, such as mapping land cover or detecting changes.\"The National Land Cover Database (NLCD), established in 2001, is updated every 2-3 years with satellite images categorized by tree covers, urban areas, roads and more. NLCD has had eight epochs so far, with the most recent database available was released in 2019 . Before NLCD 2019, images from 435 pathways\u2014or organized rows Landsat follows as it collects images\u2014were used to map the continental United States.\"Despite the best efforts of the NLCD operation team to acquire a single leaf-on image with less than 20% cloud cover from the target year, a mean of 70% of individual Landsat images were from the seven target years, 25% of images were one year deviated from the target years, and 5% of images were more than one year off,\" Jin said.When Landsat cannot capture a clear enough image in a specific year, the dataset is filled in with images from other years. This provides a better understanding than having no image of a particular area, but land coverage can change significantly in a year or more.\"Substantial time and effort were spent on producing the final clear Landsat images, which included cloud and shadow detection, a gap-filling method and hand editing,\" Jin said. \"To shorten the latency of producing the new NLCD product and to reduce the amount of work needed to process individual-date Landsat imagery, we developed a more efficient image compositing strategy to generate clean images.\"The researchers developed an algorithm that selects an image pixel from a single date over time\u2014such as June 5 over a set time window\u2014that is as close as possible to the virtual median-value point. This virtual point has a median value from each band of all valid observations. The team also developed a method to detect and replace clouds and cloud shadows pixels on composite images. For example, for an image pixel of a forested area, the algorithm may identify that a clouded area isn't a different type of coverage by comparing it to surrounding points. It can then splice images together to correct gaps or otherwise misunderstood information.\"We developed a new and straightforward image compositing method,\" Jin said. \"Our algorithm was shown to produce the best results for seasonal composites in the spectral and application evaluations among 10 compositing algorithms.\"This method was also applied to the National Land Cover Database 2019 data and produced the final clean images, which were released in July 2021.\"The new strategy not only solves the issue of residual cloud, shadow and missing-value areas on composite images, but also reduces redundancy and improves efficiency by reducing overlap areas among mapping units compared to using individual Landsat path/row scenes,\" Jin said. \"The new strategy for producing clean Landsat composite images improved both National Land Cover Database 2019 operational efficiency and quality.\" More information:Suming Jin et al, National Land Cover Database 2019: A New Strategy for Creating Clean Leaf-On and Leaf-Off Landsat Composite Images, Journal of Remote Sensing (2023).

  "text": "Tropical cyclone (TCs) are one of the most destructive types of weather event on Earth, damaging people's lives and their property, local infrastructure, and subsequently causing enormous economic losses. TCs are strong circular storms originating in the warm tropical oceans and are accompanied by heavy rainfall and strong winds.          However, there has been no consensus among scientists regarding the global-scale trends of TC frequency and intensity due to climate change effects on ocean temperatures. Hence, to achieve this, and ultimately be better prepared for these extreme weather events in the future, a holistic evaluation of the different TC characteristics across ocean basins is vital.In a recent study published in Atmospheric and Oceanic Science Letters, Professor Wen Zhou from Fudan University, China, and Erandani Lakshani, a post-graduate researcher at the City University of Hong Kong, have shed more light on the observed decadal-scale shifts and trends in global TC activities from 1980 to 2021.The study reveals that there has been a significant increase in the number of TCs in the North Atlantic basin and North Indian Ocean over the past four decades, while there has been a decrease in the western North Pacific. It was also found that the genesis of TCs in the East Pacific, southern Indian Ocean, and South Pacific Ocean basins has declined since 1980, albeit this trend is not statistically significant.Along with the frequency of TC genesis, the intensity of TCs has also varied significantly among the different ocean basins.\"Notably, the average maximum TC intensity over the North Indian Ocean has increased recently, and this can be explained by an upward trend in mid-tropospheric relative humidity and decreasing vertical wind shear in the this basin,\" say Professor Zhou and Lakshani. Their study also points out that the average TC intensity in the East Pacific has decreased dramatically, whereas over the South Pacific it has increased significantly.Moreover, they observed an increasing TC intensity trend in the western North Pacific but a decreasing trend over the North Atlantic. The TC intensity in the North Atlantic may be linked to the decreasing trend in mid-tropospheric relative humidity, mainly south of the North Atlantic.Another finding of this work is the indication of a significant association between the average large-scale characteristics of both vertical wind shear and relative humidity and the TC frequency in the different ocean basins. Moreover, the interdependence of TC frequency, vertical wind shear and relative humidity varies across the basins, indicating an inter-basin teleconnection (a term used in the atmospheric sciences to describe climate links between geographically separated regions).In summary, this study provides valuable insights into global TC trends, which is critical towards improving our understanding of the evolution of TCs. Moreover, the study highlights the need for continued research into the underlying causes of these shifts in TC activity for future predictability and preparedness.

  "text": "Clouds are made up of individual, microscopic spheres of water, or hydrometeors, that change and interact with one another based on environmental conditions and the characteristics of the hydrometeor population, such as size and water phase: liquid, ice or vapor.          Improved modeling of the effects of environmental conditions on hydrometeor populations can enhance short- and longer-term weather forecasting and optimize solar energy capture. This review highlights understudied, yet promising areas of cloud microphysics and modeling and outlines the future challenges and directions of this emerging field.The microscopic hydrometeors that make up clouds vary based on their size and water phase. Processes such as condensation and other, less obvious processes, like turbulence, radiative effect, lightning and chemical processes, interact with one another to regulate the hydrometeor population and the characteristics of a cloud at the microscopic level. Modeling the effects of processes on hydrometeors both individually and collectively with other processes is immensely challenging.A team of leading atmospheric scientists, including researchers from Brookhaven National Laboratory, U.S.; McGill University, Canada; Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, China; and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, U.S.), identified areas where more research is required to improve modeling equations and challenges that will need to be overcome to improve weather forecasting, climate prediction and solar energy harvesting to optimize the use of renewable energy sources.The research team published their review in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences.\"We wanted to review some key aspects of explicit modeling and representation in various computer models of cloud microphysics, identify outstanding challenges, and discuss future research directions,\" said Yangang Liu, first author of the team's review and senior scientist in the Environmental and Climate Sciences Department at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, U.S..\"This review integrates different topics on which each of the co-authors have expertise into a cohesive unification, including different approaches for developing bulk microphysics parameterizations (approximate representations), \u2026 explicit modeling, and theoretical formulations. We believe that such an integrated approach is crucial for further advancing the field,\" said Liu.      \"Cloud microphysics and their representation is becoming increasingly important as the resolutions of numerical weather prediction and climate models improve. Furthermore, significant knowledge gaps remain and need to be addressed in our physical understanding of cloud microphysical processes [such as] turbulence-microphysics interactions,\" said Liu.Relatively little is known about the effects of small-scale turbulence on hydrometeors and other processes in the cloud. Turbulence-related processes, in particular, have not been included in most atmospheric modeling, despite the important role turbulence plays in the microphysics of clouds. Additional research in this area could significantly improve future modeling .Liu and his colleagues identified several other challenges that, once overcome, will greatly advance the field's understanding of cloud processes and improve prediction. For example, comparing the different cloud microphysics modeling strategies to one another and understanding how and why they differ could enhance the accuracy of each platform. Additionally, seeking effective evaluation and integration of models and observations at different scales is needed to address cloud-related problems.Increased computational power and use of artificial intelligence will also present new tools for researchers to improve the modeling of cloud microphysics in the future. Direct numerical simulations (DNSs), in particular, require a great deal of computing power to resolve individual hydrometeor particles, but have already significantly advanced modeling of warm cloud processes.\"We plan to further advance the specific areas each of us [has] been focusing on as well as go beyond our comfort zones to seek effective integration by capitalizing on advances in other disciplines such as computational technologies, machine learning and complex systems science, including development of bulk microphysics parameterizations, explicit modeling, and theoretical formulations,\" said Liu.

  "text": "Researchers probing one Canada's most productive fishing regions have found the area off Nova Scotia's southern tip is littered with bundles of snarled rope, drifting lobster pots and abandoned buoys that foul the marine environment and take a bite out of the industry's bottom line.          The team of Dalhousie University scientists worked with the Department of Fisheries, fishing captains, volunteers and different fisheries organizations to search for and retrieve abandoned, lost and discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) from three fishing zones that stretch from the Bay of Fundy around to Halifax over two years.Boats towing hooked grapples over a 4,000-square kilometer swath of seafloor hauled in almost 25,000 kilograms of ALDFG\u2014a motley collection of traps, ropes, hooks, cables and other fishing-related equipment that drift through the water column or rest on the ocean bottom.Team members, who published their findings in Marine Pollution Bulletin, also collected almost 5,000 kilograms of assorted gear from seven shoreline searches. Of this, lobster traps made up 68 percent and dragger cable constituted 12 percent.\"Ghost gear continues to degrade the environment through marine pollution, but it also poses threats to target and non-target species, including those at risk,\" says co-author Dr. Tony Walker, an associate professor in Dal's School for Resource and Environmental Studies.\"It also results in economic impacts on an industry on which much of coastal Nova Scotia depends.\"A ubiquitous global problemRetrieved gear varied in type, age, condition and weight, with 30 percent of lobster traps about one year old while the remaining 70 percent ranged in age from two to 37 years old. Roughly one-third of all traps retrieved were tagged, useable and less than three to four years old. They were taken to spots where they could be returned to fishers.The traps contained more than 650 lobsters and almost 60 fish, 42 of which were species at risk, including Atlantic wolffish, Atlantic cod, white hake, spiny dogfish and thorny skate. Most of these were released back into the ocean.Some retrieved buoys in the Pubnico and Yarmouth areas came from the United States, highlighting the multijurisdictional nature of marine debris and ghost gear, the paper states.They recovered more than 3,000 kilograms of cable, which was believed to be discarded by commercial trawl vessels when the cable was no longer of use to them.\"Marine debris is a ubiquitous global problem and makes up roughly 58 percent of macro marine debris by weight,\" says Leah Fulton, who was doing her Master of Marine Management at Dalhousie at the time and worked with Coastal Action as a mapping technician.\"Once gear enters the water, it can degrade into micro debris, create unsuitable habitat, entangle marine species, cause vessel damage, compromise catches for marine fisheries and create safety hazards in the marine environment.\"      Tackling the problemThe researchers stress that ghost gear may be intentionally dumped, but that much of it is likely caused by accidental loss following storms or gear failures.During 997 tows, the team also brought in buckets, party balloons, a chain, a bicycle tire, an engine block, a fan belt, and an aquaculture net and one of its weights. They also found aquaculture netting, \"ultimately informing us that they can also be major contributors to the marine debris problem,\" says Fulton.The fishing grounds in Southwest Nova Scotia span more than 21,000 square kilometers and include Lobster Fishing Areas 33, 34 and 35, which provide most of the country's lobster supply.The researchers estimated the economic cost associated with lost gear to be roughly $240,000 per year over the two-year study period from 2019 to 2021. Each retrieved trap contained an average of 1.6 marketable lobsters, representing significant losses to the fishery. About eight percent of lobsters released in LFA 33 were from suspected illegal, unregulated or unreported lobster traps.The team recommended that DFO increase compliance with ALDFG reporting and that community and fish harvester local knowledge is extensively and consistently gathered before retrieval efforts are conducted.\"This study highlights that gear can be identified and retrieved more effectively than in previous retrieval efforts as techniques and experience have improved,\" says Dr. Walker.\"Improving end-of-life gear and ALDFG disposal should be supported to reduce the environmental footprint of the fishing industry in marine environments and on land. Ultimately, fishers do not want to lose their gear.\" More information:Jessie McIntyre et al, Environmental and economic impacts of retrieved abandoned, lost, and discarded fishing gear in Southwest Nova Scotia, Canada, Marine Pollution Bulletin (2023).

  "text": "Economic expansion leaves indelible marks on coral chemistry, according to a new study published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans. By analyzing barium levels in coral cores, scientists can access decades-old records of regional development and erosion rates.          East and Southeast Asia have experienced rapid development over the past six decades. Cities in the region have sprawled, forests have disappeared, and agricultural fields have spread, leading to the fastest soil erosion rates in the world. Experts predict that the rates will continue to increase.Understanding where and how quickly soil is eroding is important for rapidly developing countries to sustain their agricultural output, but for many parts of East and Southeast Asia, long-term records are lacking.Corals, it turns out, have been keeping track. When sediments from land make it to the sea, they carry with them elements such as barium. Those elements change the ocean's chemistry and enter the skeletons of corals and other shallow-sea animals. Because barium is largely sourced from continents, its prevalence in coral skeletons could reflect the erosion of sediments from land to sea.Xiaohua Li and colleagues present a new multidecadal record of erosion based on barium concentrations and isotopes from coral cores. The cores came from the South China Sea near southern Taiwan and central Vietnam. Each one provided about two decades of data recorded at a monthly resolution.The core from Taiwan developed between 1980 and 2004. From 1980 to about 1995, both Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) and coral barium content increased, suggesting a link between development and erosion. Starting in 1996, GDP continued to grow, but erosion decreased. That decoupling could reflect effective soil conservation efforts, the authors say.The Vietnam core, which developed between 1978 and 2003, also showed a correlation between economic development and erosion. From the 1990s to the 2000s, Vietnam's urban areas grew about tenfold, and the coral's record of erosion increased as well.Corals may be an important historical record of erosion and economic expansion, but with threats of climate change, ocean acidification, and sediment input looming large, their dutiful watch may soon come to a close.

  "text": "Climate change is a global problem. Its origin is less so, however, because we do not all contribute equally: the countries that suffer the most from the impacts of climate change are precisely those that are the least responsible.          The problem is not only that these countries\u2014and also the poorest sectors within rich countries\u2014cannot cope with these impacts. While 195 nations around the world have signed the Paris Agreement, and while the United Nations, the IPCC and the European Union speak of a climate emergency, we cannot ignore the fact that those who accumulate the most wealth are also the main emitters of greenhouse gases.There is an accepted euphemism for this situation: excessive personal consumption. And it is essential to address it.10% responsible for 50% of emissionsThe figures speak for themselves. A 2021 study found that rich people leave a disproportionately large carbon footprint, and that the share of global emissions for which they are responsible is increasing.In 2010, the richest 10% of households emitted 34% of global carbon dioxide, while the bottom 50% of the world's population accounted for only 15%. In 2015 the situation worsened: the richest 10% were responsible for 49% of emissions, while the poorest half of the world's population produced 7%. It seems clear that reducing the carbon footprint of the richest could be the fastest way to get to net zero\u2014cutting greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possible.The problem is that tackling high consumption is not at the top of the agenda of governments, nor of key policy-makers. This is bad news for the planet and for our hopes of one day reaching zero emissions. This is why Greenpeace and Oxfam put the issue of the cars of the super rich on the public electoral debate in 2022 in France.Although wealthier households are more energy efficient, they are also larger and have more space to heat and cool. In addition, those with more financial resources own and use more energy-intensive luxury goods and accessories. It is much easier for wealthier consumers to absorb any cost increases without changing their behavior.Another example: in most countries, before the COVID-19 pandemic, half of the emissions from passenger aviation were related to the 1% of people who flew more often.Policy neglect of these large resource consumers is a \"missed opportunity\" to address inequality and carbon reduction opportunities.      Inequality environmentally very costlyIt's not just a question of ethics. Economic inequality is environmentally costly. Joel Millward-Hopkins has calculated that, in energy terms, it is twice the consumption of an equal society.Ecological collapse and economic inequality are among the greatest contemporary challenges, and the two issues are completely intertwined and have been throughout the history of civilisations. Yet the world economy continues to move toward ecological crisis, and the energy costs of inequality are far more significant than those of population size. Even the most moderate levels of inequality that citizens consider acceptable increase the energy needed to provide a universally decent life by 40%.At that degree of socially tolerated inequality, a super-rich global 1% consumes as much energy as would be needed to provide a decent life for 1.7 billion people. Mitigating climate change quickly requires profound social changes that reduce economic inequalities.Climate tax for the mega-richEfforts to cut carbon emissions often focus on the world's poorest, addressing issues such as food and energy security, and the increased emissions potential from projected population, income and consumption growth.However, more policies are needed to target those at the opposite end of the social scale: the super-rich.Countries are moving in this direction, but given the thorniness of targeting the influential classes, progress is very slow. Spain's Ministry of Ecological Transition is proposing to Brussels that people with assets of more than 100 million euros pay a \"climate tax\" that would enable the country to cope better with climate change.If the mega-rich were to pay a climate tax of approximately 2% of their wealth, this would raise an estimated 300 billion globally against climate change. The measure has the backing of science and is one of the aspects that Spain wants to consider during its forthcoming EU presidency.Meanwhile, the World Inequality Lab is not content with just appealing to our sense of ethics. Based on scientific knowledge, it seeks to address the gravest challenge that has ever confronted humanity: climate change and the socio-economic model that has generated it.

  "text": "After a historic winter hit California with dozens of atmospheric rivers, the last line of defense protecting the Pacific from much of L.A.'s trash held strong.          In the first storm season of a two-year pilot project, Ballona Creek Trash Interceptor 007 stopped nearly 155,000 pounds of garbage from flowing out to the ocean.\"Its performance has exceeded our wildest expectations,\" said Boyan Slat, founder and chief executive of the Ocean Cleanup. The Dutch nonprofit partnered with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works to introduce the interceptor in October.The system floats a few hundred yards from the outlet of Ballona Creek into the Pacific Ocean, its twin booms extended to the shoreline to funnel trash to a solar-powered system that lifts objects from the water with a conveyor belt and drops them into six dumpsters. The trash collects in the dumpsters and awaits manual removal.On a recent Friday morning, members of the public works agency were escorted by a local yacht club to witness what could be the final trash offloading of the season.The California Yacht Club, which chartered the brief expedition, has partnered with the interceptor project to allow students to see the device in action using club vessels. Its logo will be added to the device, alongside that of Coca-Cola and other sponsors, in the coming weeks.Ocean Cleanup is not being compensated for the project; the Department of Public Works has staffed the trash interceptor at taxpayers' expense, by way of the county flood fund with support from contractor Ocean Blue.Hours after the last major rain of the season Friday, a small motorboat chartered by Ocean Blue approached the interceptor and was attached by crews to the internal barge holding the dumpsters.The boat then towed the barge to the Marina del Rey launch ramp, where additional crews with Ocean Blue were waiting with a crane, a scale and a truck.The crane slowly lifted a net from each dumpster\u2014the operator shouting out the weight of the debris contained therein\u2014and deposited the contents in a shipping container that would be trucked off for sorting.\"Thirty-six hundred!\" the operator yelled as one particularly full net hung from the crane, to approving nods from several crew members. About a dozen workers participated in the offloading from start to finish, and the haul was 19,880 pounds of trash, according to Department of Public Works spokesman Kerjon Lee.      Paper bags and soda bottles, likely washed into the marina from nearby areas in the previous night's rain, bobbed around on the water's surface in the basin, a reminder of the pervasive problem of ocean pollution.In all, the first rainy season of the interceptor's operation saw the collection of 77 tons of material, of which nearly two-thirds was inorganic.This first pilot year \"had all the challenges we wanted it to have: heavy pollutants, lots of flow,\" said Mark Pestrella, the Department of Public Works director. In January, storm-generated waves caused one boom to tear, and it had to be replaced.According to Lee, L.A. County Department of Beaches and Harbors maintenance crews noted \"a 75% reduction\" in trash along local beaches adjacent to the interceptor.Though the department has yet to issue its first-year report, which will include the cost of the program, Pestrella said that capturing trash early was \"way, way cheaper\" than county crews collecting it from beaches.The device, which will be donated to the county if officials deem its two-year pilot a success, may end up saving taxpayers some money, even when taking into account the costs of staffing it.Even with the success of Interceptor 007, which Pestrella said was the only one of its kind in the U.S., major problems with pollution in L.A. County waterways persist.\"None of the waterways in L.A. County are considered fishable or swimmable\" due to pollution, he said, and tests show \"toxicity in every drainage for some pollutant of concern.\"He pointed to industrial and corporate polluters, who he said leave cleanup duties to citizens and government. \"I don't see enough corporate participation\" in cleanup efforts, he said.\"The burden cannot be all put on the taxpayer, the residential property owner or, for that matter, the renter,\" Pestrella said.But for residents who do want to pitch in, he advised calling (888) 253-2652 or visiting the Clean L.A. website for information about proper trash disposal methods.\"They're making a ton of money off of that trash on the front end,\" he said, alluding to products, packaging and advertising materials that can end up in waterways, \"and we're picking it up at another cost to the consumer.\"Angelenos produce 4 to 5 pounds of trash per person per day, he said, and too often the trash is disposed of improperly. \"The ocean and these rivers,\" Pestrella said, \"should not be the trash can of our community.\"    2023 Los Angeles Times.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "text": "Improved cookstoves, which are widely used for cooking in developing countries, produce twice as many harmful ultrafine air pollution particles (PM0.1) as conventional stoves, according to a new study from the University of Surrey.          Researchers from Surrey's Global Center for Clean Air Research (GCARE) found that while improved cookstoves can reduce fine particles (PM2.5) by up to 65%, they can actually increase the emission of ultrafine particles.The GCARE team also found that ultrafine particles' large surface areas allow them to absorb a significant amount of hazardous metals and chemicals, such as arsenic, lead, nitrate, sulfate and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.Professor Prashant Kumar, co-author of the study and Director of GCARE at the University of Surrey, said, \"The global cost-of-living crisis has led to many turning to wood, coal, peat and other biomass fuels for domestic fuel combustion to cook or heat their homes. Unfortunately, our research suggests that there may be an even higher health cost to pay in the near future.\"These tiny particles can easily infiltrate the nasal passages, leading to potential health risks, and our most vulnerable will pick up that bill.\"Improved cookstoves are designed to reduce fuel consumption, smoke and harmful emissions during cooking. In addition, they are often designed to be more efficient and to burn fuel more thoroughly than traditional stoves.Despite the known health impacts of domestic burning, it is thought that 2.8 billion people globally use solid fuels for heating their homes. About 20% of households in Ireland use wood for fuel. According to the Environment Protection Agency, approximately 12.7 million people in America use wood as a major heat source.Professor Kumar added, \"One bright spot that needs to be investigated further is the development of DEFRA-approved heat stoves that are designed to improve combustion efficiency and reduce pollutant emission. The use of eco-fuel pellets that emit fewer toxic fumes should also be considered as part of the package for improving the status quo.\"This is clearly a global issue impacting developing countries and superpowers alike, and so we all need to come together to ensure that clean air is available to all of society and not just the fortunate few.\"The study is published in the journal Science of The Total Environment.

  "text": "An international team including Simon Steidle from the Quaternary Research Group at the Department of Geology at the University of Innsbruck has reconstructed the evolution of groundwater in the Great Basin, U.S.\u2014one of the driest regions on Earth\u2014up to 350,000 years into the past with unprecedented accuracy.          The results shed new light on the effects of climate change on water supply and provide important insights for the sustainable use of groundwater resources. The study was published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.The team led by Christoph Sp\u00f6tl has been investigating the famous \"Devils Hole\" cave system in Nevada since 2010\u2014during spectacular expeditions. Using the calcite deposits in the cave, the researchers have already reconstructed the development of the water level in the cave up to several hundred thousand years ago. In the current study, this information has now been combined with a numerical groundwater model for this arid region.\"Based on our extensive sampling in Devils Hole, we have a large amount of data that provides information on the evolution of the water table. By combining this with groundwater models from the US Geological Survey, we can now draw quantitative conclusions about changes in precipitation for the entire region over the last 350,000 years using the precise data from the cave,\" explains the geologist Simon Steidle.In drylands like the southwest of the U.S., precipitation is particularly important and groundwater data is a mirror of changes in the hydroclimate. \"The results can be useful for developing water management strategies and sustainable use of groundwater resources, such as how much water can be withdrawn for agricultural purposes,\" says Steidle.Drought increases sensitivityThe new data suggest that the elevation of the water table in Devils Hole was three to four times more sensitive to groundwater recharge during dry climates than during wetter climates of the past. \"Given that drought conditions will likely increase even more in the future due to the ongoing climate crisis, our results highlight the vulnerability of large aquifers, and thus the alteration of the most important freshwater resource in this area of the United States,\" Steidle said.The minimum groundwater level in Devils Hole during the peak of the interglacial warm periods was no more than 1.6 meters below today's level, which corresponds to a decrease in groundwater recharge of less than 17% compared to today's conditions. During the glacial periods, however, the level was at least 9.5 meters above today's level, which means an increase in groundwater recharge of almost 250% compared to today's conditions.The new information is relevant especially for the already highly endangered Devils Hole pupfish, a fish measuring just a few centimeters whose only habitat is the water in Devils Hole. The habitat of this species is thus the smallest of all known vertebrates (about half the size of an average classroom). Even small changes in water availability triggered by abstraction of groundwater for irrigation purposes or by climate change are of utmost importance for its survival. More information:Tracie R.

  "text": "A team of atmospheric scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology and the University of California, has found that the number of atmospheric rivers associated with flooding in India has been rising as the planet continues to grow warmer.          In their paper published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, the group describes how they analyzed data from multiple sources to track the number of atmospheric rivers affecting India and how it has led to increased flooding in that country.Atmospheric rivers (ARs) have been in the news of late due to several of them that caused flooding in California this past winter. But ARs do not impact just the US, they can form and cause increased amounts of rain in many parts of the world. In this new effort, the research team sought to learn more about the impact of ARs on India\u2014a country well accustomed to annual flooding during the monsoon season.ARs are channels of moisture-laden air. They form when air pressure systems collide, pushing air with a lot of moisture in a stream-like fashion through the atmosphere. As they grow in size, they become similar to rivers flowing across the sky. When they meet land, the air pressure relents, allowing the moisture to be released, quite often in dramatic fashion.In this new effort, the researchers team examined weather records from the European Reanalysis Version, the Dartmouth Flood Observatory and the India Meteorological Department for the years 1951 through 2020 looking for evidence of ARs that have had an impact on India, most particularly during monsoon seasons.In so doing, they found AR events impacted the country 596 times, 95% of which occurred during a monsoon season. They also found that 54% of the biggest AR events occurred over the past three decades, suggesting they are not only forming more often but are getting bigger as the planet grows warmer.The researchers note that warmer ocean surface temperatures over parts of the Indian Ocean have led to more evaporation, which in turn has led to more rain when ARs form. The increase in rain amounts has led to massive floods which have destroyed property and killed thousands of people.

  "text": "President Joe Biden's administration on Thursday announced sweeping plans to curb planet-warming emissions from the nation's power stations, as part of the United States' efforts to combat the climate crisis.          Starting from 2030, the proposal would target fossil fuel electricity production with increasingly stringent carbon reduction requirements, including compelling some coal plants to directly capture pollution from their smokestacks.\"In every corner of our nation, Americans are seeing and feeling the devastating impacts of climate change,\" Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Michael Regan said at an event announcing the draft rules.\"It's clear that we've reached a pivotal point in human history, and it's on all of us to act right now to protect our future.\"The agency estimated its measures targeting coal and natural gas would prevent 617 million metric tons of total carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere through 2042, equivalent to reducing the annual emissions of half the cars in the United States.But the proposals are certain to face legal challenges from Republican-run states that could place them before the conservative-majority Supreme Court, which has previously knocked back efforts to regulate the sector.US Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell denounced the proposals, saying they posed \"an existential threat to providers of affordable and reliable American energy.\"US power plant emissions have been declining, thanks to a drop in the cost of renewables. But they are still responsible for a quarter of greenhouse gasses produced by the world's largest economy.That has made it a prime target for Biden, who has pledged to cut emissions from electricity production to zero by 2035.\"I think this rule is important by declaring that the era of unlimited carbon pollution from power plants is over,\" Dan Lashof, director of World Resources Institute, United States, told AFP.The proposed standards \"mark a pivotal turning point,\" with the EPA \"rightfully and necessarily moving to hold coal- and gas-fired power plants to account for their ongoing carbon pollution,\" added Julie McNamara of the Union of Concerned Scientists.Carbon captureUnder the rules, measures for fossil fuel plants would vary by the type of plant, whether it operates frequently or just to shore up the grid during peak demand, and how long it is planned to remain in service.For example, coal-fired plants that don't have commitments to retire by 2040 would be required to remove 90 percent of their carbon starting from 2030. On the other hand, coal plants set to retire by 2032 will face no restrictions.Natural gas power stations that run frequently will be required to either implement carbon capture technology, or partly switch to hydrogen, which burns without emissions.Both Lashof and McNamara said they had hoped for deeper and faster reductions for gas plants.Boosting the use of carbon capture was slammed both by climate justice groups and the fossil fuel industry.\"If we are to combat climate change we must do so with real, viable solutions\u2014not unproven technologies that only promise to continue the legacy of dumping pollutants onto frontline communities,\" said Ozawa Bineshi Albert of the Climate Justice Alliance.The National Mining Association said that although carbon capture was key to the future, mandating its use \"before this technology is technically and fully economically demonstrated is nothing more than unlawful showmanship reinforcing a destructive agenda.\"The technology is in its infancy, with only \"around 35\" facilities globally applying it for industrial processes, fuel transformation and power generation, according to the International Energy Agency.But the Biden administration is betting on the Inflation Reduction Act, which offers tax credits for carbon capture, coupled with advances in the technology, to speed up adoption.      Legally defensible?Former president Barack Obama first tried to regulate the power sector almost a decade ago, but the high court ruled his plans were too broad and exceeded the executive branch's authority.The new rule limits itself to acting \"within the fence line\" of an individual power plant, which officials hope will improve its chances of surviving legal challenges.The proposed rules come a month after the EPA unveiled new auto emissions regulations, and plans to sharply reduce emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, by the oil and gas industry.Biden, who faces a tough re-election campaign, sees keeping his promises on climate action as key to energizing younger voters.The plans would be subject to a public comment period and likely wouldn't be finalized until next year.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:US moves to curb power plant emissions (2023, May 11)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-biden-administration-curb-emissions-power.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "question_squad": " What is helium-3?",
  "answer_squad": " a helium isotope with one neutron in its nucleus",
  "text": "Two geoscientists, one with Princeton University, the other with Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, have developed a theory to explain how helium-3 leaks from the Earth's core into the mantle. In their study, reported in the journal Nature Geoscience, Jie Deng and Zhixue Du used first-principle calculations to show that helium-3 could enter magnesium oxide at the core-mantle boundary, allowing its entry into the mantle.          Helium-3, a helium isotope with one neutron in its nucleus instead of the more common two, is extremely rare on Earth's surface, but recent research has shown that it can be found in volcanic rock formations on the ocean floor. The finding suggests that some process allows helium-3 to seep from the core into the mantle. Scientists would like to obtain more helium-3 because it has proven useful in fusion reactors as a source of fuel.Prior research has suggested that there is a large amount of helium-3 locked in Earth's core\u2014planetary scientists believe it got there during the formation of the planet. Helium-3 was a constituent of the dust and gases that coalesced approximately 4.5 billion years ago. And because of its nature, it became locked into the core. But some process has been allowing some of it to escape into the mantle, and now, Deng and Du believe they may have figured out why.Prior research has shown that when helium-3 comes into contact with magnesium oxide, it exsolves, which means it is changed from an initial homogenous mineral into one that has crystalline phases. As part of the process, the helium is physically moved to the location of the magnesium oxide.The researchers mathematically demonstrated that helium-3 could have been pulled from the core through interactions with magnesium oxide shortly after the planet formed, continuing right up to the present. Their math shows that over the lifetime of the planet, as helium-3 was exsolved, it could have slowly made its way to parts of the mantle, where it may have risen to the surface through volcanic activity.

In total, 76 forest and brush fires remained active in the province compared to 110 a few days ago, authorities said. Twenty-three are still considered uncontrolled.Several Canadian provinces\u2014as well as the US states of Oregon and Alaska\u2014sent reinforcements to fight the wildfires, which authorities said could flare again as high temperatures return over the weekend.\"We're very happy to have new resources coming in from our colleagues across Canada and colleagues in the United States.

But the task has never been easier, nor the haul bigger, thanks to recent torrential rains.          \"This year, there's a lot of new spots\" to find gold, says Fausel, clad in a wetsuit and snorkel, standing up to his knees in water.Less than 10 minutes into a recent visit by AFP, Fausel\u2014diving with a small shovel to dig a crevice at the bottom of the riverbed\u2014resurfaces with proof.Among the mix of clay and sand emptied onto a plastic tray, unmistakable shiny particles glitter brightly under the strong midday sun.\"Mother Nature has done a great job with all this flooding,\" he said.While his search near the shoreline has yielded \"a small amount of gold,\" he predicts that closer to the middle of the river, \"there's probably going to be a lot larger, bigger, heavier pieces.\"Fausel collects his bounty with a tool that resembles a suction pump, before adjusting his snorkel and disappearing back into the water.'Flood gold'California is emerging from an unusually wet winter, with near-record rainfall.A series of atmospheric rivers\u2014high altitude ribbons of moisture\u2014chugged into the western United States, dousing a landscape that had been baked dry by years of below-average rain.                Albert Fausel points to specks of gold found in a creek in Placerville, California -- recent downpours have yielded prime conditions for gold hunting.             In Northern California, those downpours triggered scenes reminiscent\u2014if on a far smaller scale\u2014of the original Gold Rush that transformed this region in the 19th century, when thousands of miners arrived in search of El Dorado.\"Now, we're talking about flood gold,\" said Barron Brandon, a geologist and foreman of the Cosumnes River Ranch.Heavy rainfall creates powerful currents in the river that \"wash\" the banks, loosening particles of mud and gold, which are then carried downstream to be scooped up by lucky miners.The river acts \"like a big sluice box... just on a very grand scale,\" said Brandon, who also pans for gold in summer as a hobby.\"The real gold is just being out here,\" he added, smiling as he takes in the landscape of blue and green hues, soundtracked only by the gushing flow of the water.                Barron Brandon demonstrates his gold panning technique from the banks of the Cosumnes River -- he calls the conditions 'flood gold'             Gold feverPlacerville\u2014around 40 miles (70 kilometers) from California's state capital Sacramento\u2014relies heavily on tourism, most of which is themed on its golden history.Through the small city runs a road called the \"El Dorado Freeway.\" Stores with names like Ancient Gold Jewelers, Gold Country Artists Gallery and Gold Insurance Solutions dot the street.In one toy store, plastic mining helmets and miniature panning trays take up half of the display space.A hotel on the main street maintains the aesthetics of the original Gold Rush, with 19th-century furniture and photographs from that bygone era.A hardware store run by Fausel sells a wide range of mining and panning tools, such as sluice boxes and metal detectors, as well as brightly painted souvenir \"gold seeds.\"But Fausel is not worried about a tide of outsiders invading the region in a new wave of gold fever.\"Come out to California. Give yourself a chance to find some gold,\" he urged. \"It's out here for everybody. But follow all the rules.\"                Barron Brandon (L) says enjoying the natural splendor of the Cosumnes River is part of the joy in gold panning.             'Very, very rich'Mark Dayton, a local treasure hunter with millions of views on his YouTube channel, says many of his followers have heard about the rains and are on their way.He traces the public's widespread fascination with striking gold to many children's love of tales about pirate booty.\"There's so many movies like 'Indiana Jones' and all those movies, 'Pirates of the Caribbean'\u2014they all pull at the heartstrings of treasure,\" he said.One of Placerville's main attractions is the Gold Bug Park and Mine, while draws visiting school groups.\"Kids are always interested about the gold... California was built on gold,\" said Pat Layne, an 80-year-old volunteer guide who worked in gold mining for decades.\"What we try and get across to them is the true history, not the Hollywood version of the Gold Rush,\" he added.                    The history of gold in the region is explained on a sign above gold trinkets for sale from the gift shop at the Gold Bug Mine Museum in Placerville, which relies on tourism themed around its golden history.                                     Mark Dayton uses a metal detector to look for gold -- he says many of his YouTube followers are planning trips to California to hunt for 'flood gold'                 Standing next to a tributary of the river that borders the now-defunct mine, Layne describes to visitors how there were once \"hundreds of miners right here in this creek, right where we're standing, working, panning gold.\"\"It was very, very rich here... gold was delivered to the creeks by Mother Nature over millions of years.\"This winter's huge amount of rain has helped to recreate those conditions, on a much briefer and accelerated scale.When \"the water moves, the gold moves,\" he said.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:California's wet winter sparks a new gold rush (2023, May 11)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-california-winter-gold.html  This document is subject to copyright.

Chan School of Public Health. The researchers also estimate that the LCRR generates at least $2 billion in infrastructure benefits\u2014something the EPA has never calculated\u2014bringing its total benefit to cost ratio to at least 35:1, compared to the EPA's stated benefit to cost ratio of 2:1.          \"We thought the benefits of the LCRR might exceed costs by an order of magnitude\u2014but they were many times that,\" said co-lead author Ronnie Levin, instructor in the Department of Environmental Health. \"The benefits include better health for children and adults; non-health benefits in the form of reduced corrosion damage to water infrastructure and appliances; and improved equity in the U.S., as lead-contaminated drinking water disproportionately impacts low-income and minority populations on whom health damages have more severe effects.\"The final version of the study was posted online May 4, 2023, and will be published in the July 15, 2023 edition of Environmental Research. Currently, the EPA is developing the Lead and Copper Rule Improvements (LCRI), a set of new regulations intended to improve upon the impacts of the LCRR.To assess these impacts, the researchers performed a cost-benefit analysis by monetizing all 17 of the health endpoints determined by the EPA to be causally related to lead exposure. These health endpoints include preterm birth, declining cognitive function in children, and hypertension and coronary heart disease in adults. According to the analysis, the LCRR generates a sum of annual benefits much larger than the annual cost of its implementation: $335 million for implementation costs versus $9.2 billion in health damages avoided each year, plus between $2.4 billion and $7.8 billion in infrastructure damages avoided. By comparison, the EPA published a cost-benefit analysis of the LCRR that posited that the regulations generate only $645 million annually in avoided health damages. The EPA's analysis was based on monetization of only one health endpoint.The EPA implemented the LCRR in 2021 to strengthen the 1991 Lead and Copper Rule. The LCRR called for sampling for lead at schools and childcare facilities, providing better information to communities, and requiring better corrosion control treatment and identification of lead pipes. Soon after, the agency introduced the LCRI to address the shortcomings of the LCRR, particularly around equity. The LCRI would strengthen tap sampling requirements and improve compliance to identify locations with elevated water lead levels and urgently replace lead service lines, particularly in historically marginalized communities disproportionately impacted by lead exposure. The EPA has committed to publishing the LCRI by the end of 2024.\"Our study found that stronger rules to reduce lead in drinking water come with enormous benefits for individuals and the United States as a whole. Therefore, we believe the LCRR should be made as rigorous as possible,\" said co-lead author Joel Schwartz, professor in the Department of Environmental Health.

  "text": "Neither artificial intelligence nor the metaverse will define the cities of the future. Instead, everything points to it being something as matter of fact as proximity to services. This is what's known as the 15-minute city, and work is already being carried out on it in cities like Barcelona, Paris, Bogot\u00e1, Shanghai and Melbourne.          In this new urban model, based on traveling by foot, one urban feature that is not always given the attention it deserves takes on particular importance: the sidewalk. This topic has been studied by three researchers from the Complex Systems (CoSIN3) group of the Internet Interdisciplinary Institute (IN3) at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC): Daniel Rhoads, Albert Sol\u00e9 Ribalta and Javier Borge Holthoefer.\"We have developed a flexible framework to test the robustness of city sidewalk networks in relation to residents' diverse mobility constraints and have applied it to Barcelona,\" explained Rhoads. The result is that \"even a pedestrian-friendly city like Barcelona does not hold up to the 15-minute city when moderate physical limitations are taken into account.\"\"For the last 100 years, humankind has created cities designed for traveling by car. Now, they're beginning to be adapted for moving around by foot,\" said Rhoads. In the study, the results of which have been published as open access in the journal Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, the authors discuss different approaches to improving the sidewalk network. \"We propose a framework for assessing multi-factor walkability using percolation theory and insights into pedestrian behavior,\" explained Rhoads.The authors worked on a digital depiction of Barcelona's sidewalk system, with information such as sidewalk width, slope and risk level based on traffic accident data. The method employed allowed the researchers to see how network connectivity varies depending upon people's mobility requirements.\"For instance, someone in a wheelchair requires at least two meters' width and slopes that are not in excess of two degrees,\" said Rhoads. \"By focusing our analysis on any point in the city, we can ascertain how many key services can be accessed by someone within a 15-minute walk, under any combination of conditions.\"The 15-minute city\"This is a quite recent idea put forward by the urbanist Carlos Moreno, a Paris-based Colombian, in which cars are kept away from the city's center,\" said Rhoads. Broadly speaking, this new urban model seeks to ensure that all everyday needs can be met within a reasonable walk's distance: going to a supermarket, to the doctor, to school, to a park, to the library or to a public transport stop.\"This means all these services must be distributed across the whole of a city's territory but, first of all, there is a need to define what key services actually are and what the optimal locations to reach the greatest number of people are,\" said Rhoads. \"Rebuilding cities is not easy.\"\"With its superblocks policy, Barcelona is making progress towards this model. At a global level, due to its reasonable size, its robust public transport system, and the distribution of the population throughout the urban area, which combines residential buildings and businesses, it can already be considered a fairly walkable city,\" said Rhoads from the United States, where he lives. \"Here, cities are much more horizontal, the distances are enormous, and everything is designed for cars.\"The ultimate goal of the 15-minute city is to improve the quality of life of its inhabitants. \"Walking is a healthy way of exercising and, by reducing the number of trips made in vehicles powered by combustion engines, it improves air quality, cuts greenhouse gas emissions and reduces the risk of traffic accidents,\" Rhoads pointed out.

  "text": "Boreal wetlands are a significant source of isoprene and terpenes, a class of highly reactive organic compounds that have a substantial impact on the Earth's climate, according to a new study led by the University of Eastern Finland and published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics.          The study was conducted in collaboration between the University of Eastern Finland, the University of Helsinki, the Finnish Meteorological Institute, the Institute of Environmental Assessment and Water Research in Spain, and the University of California Irvine in the US.The researchers used a combination of field measurements and modeling to investigate the emission rates of isoprene and terpenes from boreal wetlands. Boreal wetlands cover a substantial fraction of the land mass in the northern latitudes, from northern Europe to Siberia and Canada. The team found that these emissions are much higher than previously thought and that they exhibit a particularly strong exponential temperature response, making boreal wetlands a potentially significant source of these compounds due to global warming.\"Our study shows that boreal wetlands are a large source of isoprene and terpenes, which contribute to the formation of secondary organic aerosol and ozone. The isoprene and terpene emissions from these wetlands have been understudied. We used an ecosystem-scale eddy covariance measurement technique to quantify the emissions from a boreal wetland during the unusually warm early summer of 2021,\" says first author, Doctoral Researcher Lejish Vettikkat of the University of Eastern Finland.Credit: University of Eastern FinlandThe emission rates of isoprene and terpenes from boreal wetlands are dependent on temperature, solar radiation, and vegetation leaf area (i.e., wetland grasses and shrubs). Most strikingly, the measurements revealed a much stronger response of these emissions to unusually high temperatures (above 30 \u00b0C). Moreover, this response persisted for a period of time after the event, indicating a heat stress reaction by the plants that are not acclimated to these high temperatures.The team also determined the emissions of a previously undetected class of larger terpenes, called diterpenes, which could especially efficiently form aerosols, which influence the Earth's radiation balance, mostly via a cooling effect.\"Our results suggest that boreal wetlands could have a significant impact on the Earth's climate system, especially as temperatures continue to rise. It is important that we continue to study and monitor these emissions to better understand their impacts on a larger, global scale,\" notes Associate Professor Siegfried Schobesberger of the University of Eastern Finland.The researchers hope that their work will help to inform the development of more effective strategies for assessing emissions from boreal wetlands and their impact on the climate. This study underscores the need for continued research into the complex interactions between these understudied ecosystems and the Earth's climate system.

  "text": "The catastrophic Australian bushfires in 2019\u20132020 contributed to ocean cooling thousands of miles away, ultimately nudging the Tropical Pacific into a rare multi-year La Ni\u00f1a event that dissipated only recently.          The research was led by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and is published in Science Advances.La Ni\u00f1a events tend to impact the winter climate over North America, causing drier and warmer than average conditions in the southwest U.S., wetter weather in the Pacific Northwest, and colder temperatures in Canada and the northern U.S. Because the emergence of La Ni\u00f1a can often be predicted months in advance, it's an important phenomenon for seasonal climate forecasts.\"Many people quickly forgot about the Australian fires, especially as the COVID pandemic exploded, but the Earth system has a long memory, and the impacts of the fires lingered for years,\" said NCAR scientist John Fasullo, lead author of the study.A rare La Ni\u00f1a three-peatLa Ni\u00f1as are not uncommon, but an occurrence for three consecutive winters is rare. The recent run of La Ni\u00f1as, beginning in the winter of 2020\u201321 and continuing through last winter, is only the third string of three in the historical record, which dates back to 1950.The recent La Ni\u00f1a streak is also unusual because it is the only one that did not follow a strong El Ni\u00f1o\u2014a warming instead of cooling in the Tropical Pacific with similar but opposite climate impacts.Scientists have previously established that events in the Earth system, including large volcanic eruptions in the Southern Hemisphere, can shift the odds toward a La Ni\u00f1a emerging. In the case of a volcano, emissions spewed high into the atmosphere can result in the formation of light-reflecting particles called aerosols, which can cool the climate and ultimately create favorable conditions for La Ni\u00f1a.Given the massive scale of the Australian fires\u2014which burned an estimated 46 million acres\u2014Fasullo and his co-authors wondered what climate impacts the resulting emissions might have had.To investigate the question, the researchers used an advanced NCAR-based computer model called the Community Earth System Model, version 2, to run two batches of simulations on the Cheyenne system at the NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center. All the simulations started in August of 2019, before the blazes in Australia became historically large, but only one set incorporated the emissions from the wildfires as observed by satellite. The other used average wildfire emissions, the normal practice when running long-term climate model simulations.The research team found that the emissions from the wildfires, which quickly encircled the Southern Hemisphere, kicked off a chain of climate interactions. Unlike a volcanic eruption, the bulk of wildfire emissions did not make it high enough in the atmosphere to cool the climate by directly reflecting sunlight. Instead, the aerosols that formed from the emissions brightened the cloud decks across the Southern Hemisphere and especially off the coast of Peru, which cooled and dried the air in the region, ultimately shifting the zone where the northern and southern trade winds come together. The net result was a cooling of the Tropical Pacific ocean, where La Ni\u00f1as form, over multiple years.\"It's a Rube Goldberg of climate interactions that we were only able to identify because our model now represents specific details in the evolution of smoke and cloud-aerosol interactions, a recent improvement to its capabilities,\" Fasullo said.      Improving the forecastIn June 2020\u2014just a few months before the first of the three La Ni\u00f1as formed\u2014some seasonal forecasts were still predicting \"neutral\" conditions in the Tropical Pacific, meaning that neither a La Ni\u00f1a nor El Ni\u00f1o was favored. Instead, a strong three-year La Ni\u00f1a materialized.Fasullo said the new research helps explain this missed forecast and highlights the importance of using a coupled Earth system model, which includes the atmosphere and the ocean, as a forecast tool.The research also underscores the importance of having realistic wildfire emissions, both in seasonal climate predictions and long-range climate projections. Currently, biomass burning emissions in most climate model simulations are prescribed, meaning they are imposed on the model run and not determined by interactions happening within the model. For example, a simulated hot and dry period in the model simulation would not lead to more wildfires, and therefore more emissions within the simulation.\"As the climate changes, the emissions from wildfires will also change,\" Fasullo said. \"But we don't have that feedback in the model. It is the goal of our current work to incorporate these effects as realistically as possible.\" More information:John Fasullo et al, A multiyear tropical Pacific cooling response to recent Australian wildfires in CESM2, Science Advances (2023).

  "text": "At first glance, the undulating brown wrinkles of Molok Luyuk make it seem like a banal California mountain ridge. Most visitors ride ATVs up and down hillsides and litter them with shell casings from makeshift shooting ranges.          Ryan Henson was one of those visitors as a kid, dumping an old refrigerator and spending an afternoon shooting at it with family. But today he's optimistic that more people are beginning to appreciate this land and treat it like the gem he knows it is.\"You hear the botanists freaking out about this place? It's a mecca for them,\" said Henson, a policy director for the California Wilderness Coalition. \"It's not just a bunch of brush that catches on fire every now and then or a speed bump for motorcycles.\"If California conservationists, geologists, botanists and a Yolo County Native American tribe have anything in common, it's a belief that this earthen backbone is a natural phenomenon deserving of federal protection and stewardship by its indigenous inhabitants.In recent months, this diverse group has begun to push for President Joe Biden to incorporate Molok Luyuk into the adjacent national monument. A bill in Congress would do the same, recognizing it as a geological and biodiversity rarity for permanent protection.When President Barack Obama established the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument with the federal Antiquities Act in 2015, he protected 300,780 acres that extend 100 miles from Mendocino County to mountains on either side of Lake Berryessa.But the western-most ridge of the area, Molok Luyuk, was left out. Companies sought to develop wind turbine projects on the land in the years since, which have been denied by the Bureau of Land Management who deemed the area unsuitable for wind development.Now, conservationists want to finish the job and incorporate these 13,753-acres into the monument for co-management with the tribe. Californians, they hope, will soon come not to trample rare flora but to admire it and to camp alongside rare geologic history.Molok Luyuk, 'Condor Ridge'Longtime conservationist Bob Schneider believes if you give a place a name, people want to protect it. He wrote an entire book on the Berryessa region but didn't know why hills sandwiched between Clear Lake and Colusa County were called \"Walker Ridge.\"About a year ago, the idea came to him in the shower: Why not ask the people whose ancestors lived in the region for thousands of years to name it? He did, and leaders of the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation quickly came back with Molok Luyuk.Pronounced Mah-lock loo-yuck, the name means \"condor ridge\" in the tribe's Patwin language. Half a century ago the ridge was a corridor for California condors, magnificent native vultures that are slowly make a comeback from extinction.Tribal leaders hope to someday see them flying over their culturally significant lands once again.\"This area is very important to our tribe, a lot of resources and really special areas for us going back millennia. There's a lot of things to protect up there.\" said Leland Kinter, treasurer of the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation. \"To hear people say the name, it's a good feeling.\"Until arrival of European missionaries, the tribe's Patwin ancestors lived in villages that stretched across today's Colusa to Solano counties. After decimation from the missions and the Gold Rush, plus forced relocation, they were able to return to the Capay Valley in 1940.Today the federally recognized tribe with around 50 members operates Cache Creek Casino Resort and several other successful enterprises, including a golf club and acres of olive tree cultivation for the tribe's own olive oil production company.When Yocha Dehe leaders first met with local conservationists from Woodland organization Tuleyome, Yocha Dehe treasurer Kinter said things just clicked. The Bureau of Land Management simply didn't have enough enforcement resources on the ridge, they agreed.\"We had a two hour meeting,\" he said. \"It was like we didn't want to stop talking. There was just so much to share because everybody has an intimate knowledge of the area in a different way... we just saw that we have a lot to learn from each other.\"      A Californian jewelMolok Luyuk has only one hiking trail and a single campground, making public access limited. But geologists know it well, pointing out each place a visitor can traverse a hundred million of years in geological history.Both the ridge and monument next door are part of a geological and biodiversity melting pot of northern, coastal, and Central Valley parts of California. It's often lovingly called \"the best place in the world to see plate tectonics.\"That's because the area lies along the Coast Range Fault, an ancient boundary between the upper North American plate and the descending lower plate. The upper Pacific plate includes outcroppings of ancient oceanic crust called serpentine soils.California's state rock, serpentinite, is formed deep in the ocean and gets its namesake from having a texture similar to a snake's skin. In this case, it was uplifted and exposed after an ancient epic subduction event.The rock contains rare minerals that have a greenish hue, earning it the moniker 'blue goo' for its color and fragility. Yet the key part of this special rock is the barren and sparsely vegetated soil that accompanies it.That landscape might sound unappealing, but botanists marvel at the rare plants this ecological hostility creates. In fact, it has preserved one of California's few remaining plant ecosystems.Molok Luyuk has exceptional plant diversity for an area of its size, home to 7% of the state's native flora and around 490 rare plants. They include the fuchsia petals of adobe lily, dark burgundy clusters of Hoover's lomatium, grey pines and mauve jepson ceanothus.\"If the soils didn't have such challenging chemistry and physical conditions, there likely would be so many non-native plants here,\" said Nick Jenson, conservation program director of the California Native Plant Society. \"By any standard you're looking at a place that is super special. It should be managed like the jewel that it is.\"From the ridge's peak, visitors can catch views of Mount Lassen, Mount Shasta, the Trinity Alps, the Snow Mountain Wilderness and Mount Diablo. That's not to mention fields of wildfires in the adjacent Bear Valley and breathtaking scenes of nearby Cache Creek.After devastating fires in 2018 and 2020, conservationist Bob Schneider hopes monument status will translate to a surge in improvements. He wants to see application of more modern fire science in the region, such as prescribed burns.\"We used to call this area the undiscovered landscape and it still largely is,\" Schneider said. \"We need more accessibility. There should be a viewing platform, interpretive signs. I want to see a handicap parking area.\"Protection for who?The coalition of activists have allies in California Senators Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla, who reintroduced legislation this year to expand the monument and require tribal co-management. A similar effort last year failed without Republican support in the House Natural Resources Committee.Lacking optimism about their chances in Congress, they called on President Biden to do it himself.\"To establish the monument the administration wants certain things, and you're trying to show them there's sufficient support among local officials, on the ground and among tribal communities,\" said Sandra Schubert, executive director of Tuleyome. \"We're building up that record now.\"When it comes to how different types of Californians enjoy local nature, there are clear fault lines and potential conflicts. What conservationists want may not sit well with tribes, and a refuge for hikers and mountain bikers doesn't look like an ATV paradise.Tuleyome and other conservationists are reaching out to other California tribes with ancestral land nearby, including Middletown Rancheria and the Koi Nation. Co-management means they'll have a meaningful seat at the table on decisions, but not veto power.\"I think it's one of those things that keep you up at night,\" said Kinter of Yocha Dehe when asked about increasing visitors. \"Places like this are safer when people are educated about them and care about those places, so there's a balance that has to happen.... I think there's enough room for everybody.\"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the area saw a rapid jump in visits and steep decline in government capacity for rules enforcement. As long as the next phase of Molok Luyok comes with more resources, Ryan Henson with the California Wilderness Coalition is optimistic those divides can be bridged.\"We see the new addition to the monument as an opportunity for there to be an investment in this land and in forming a management plan that incorporates knowledge and wishes of our Native American partners,\" Henson said. \"Someday this place is gonna be really cool.\"    2023 The Sacramento Bee.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Sultan Al Jaber said renewables such as solar and wind \"cannot be the only answer\", especially in the steel, cement and aluminium industries, where emissions are particularly hard to reduce.While major oil producers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are touting carbon capture and storage as a remedy for global warming, some experts caution that the nascent technology is unproven and expensive, and should not replace efforts to phase out hydrocarbons.\"Renewable energies are not and cannot be the only answer,\" argued Al Jaber, who is simultaneously the head of state oil giant ADNOC and the country's climate envoy.\"If we are serious about curbing industrial emissions, we need to get serious about carbon capture technologies,\" he told the United Arab Emirates' Climate Tech event in Abu Dhabi.\"In any realistic scenario that gets us to net zero... carbon capture technology will have a role to play. Without it, the math just doesn't add up.\"We need to phase out emissions,\" added Al Jaber, reiterating his position that crude remains indispensable to the global economy and crucial to financing the energy transition.                Globe showing temperature anomalies recorded in April 2023.             COP battleground issueThe debate between carbon capture and reduced fossil fuel use is shaping as a key battleground at COP28, beginning in November in Dubai, the UAE's commercial hub.Earlier this year, the UN's climate expert panel (IPCC) said the world risks crossing the key 1.5-degree Celsius global warming threshold in about a decade, urging a drastic reduction in planet-heating emissions.One of the fastest transformations will need to be in energy, the report said, with solar and wind power already expanding dramatically.Major economies are taking key steps, with the European Union banning sales of new fossil fuel cars from 2035 and planning to nearly double renewable energy production by 2030.But greenhouse gas emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure will still push the world beyond 1.5C unless the costly and emerging carbon capture and storage technologies are utilised, the IPCC said.                A photo taken in Finland on May 3, 2023, shows ice chunks drifting in the Bothnia Gulf near the shore at the beginning of the spring.             \"Cost remains a barrier,\" said Al Jaber, president-designate of COP28.He said policymakers must provide incentives to companies to commercialise technological solutions, including carbon capture and storage (CCS) and direct air capture (DAC).CCS syphons off CO2 pollution from energy production and heavy industry and stores it underground, thus preventing it from entering the atmosphere.By contrast, direct air capture -\u2013 still in its infancy\u2014removes CO2 directly from ambient air, which makes it a \"negative emissions\" technology.      'Distraction we can't afford'Some environmentalists are sceptical about the focus on carbon capture, with Rex Weyler from Greenpeace last year labelling it a \"scam\".\"Carbon offset technologies are a distraction that we cannot afford,\" Julien Jreissati, programme director at Greenpeace MENA, told AFP on Wednesday.                    A Pakistan town damaged by flash floods of the river Swat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Pakistan was lashed by unprecedented monsoon rains in the summer of 2022 that put a third of the country underwater.                                     'Renewable energies are not and cannot be the only answer,' argued Al Jaber, who is simultaneously the head of state oil giant ADNOC and the country's climate envoy.                                     Worsening droughts have hit Iraq and over the past four years prompted Iraqi authorities to drastically limit areas under cultivation.                 \"They have yet to be commercially viable and are not proven at scale despite years of development and billions of dollars of investment.\"Worldwide, there are about 35 commercial facilities applying carbon capture, utilisation and storage to industrial processes, fuel transformation and power generation, with a total annual capture capacity of almost 45 million tonnes of CO2, according to the International Energy Agency.Current global CO2 emissions from all sources are about 40 billion tonnes.Novel DAC technologies only account for a tiny fraction\u2014about 0.1 percent\u2014of worldwide carbon dioxide removal, the first global assessment of CO2 removal said in January.More than 99 percent of extraction is done through \"conventional\" techniques such as restoring and expanding CO2-absorbing forests and wetlands, according to the State of Carbon Dioxide Removal report.The report stated that capping global warming at liveable levels will be impossible without massively scaling up the extraction of planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Climate maths 'doesn't add up' without carbon capture: COP28 chief (2023, May 10)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-climate-maths-doesnt-carbon-capture.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "The ocean absorbs a quarter of the CO\u2082 given out by human activities, playing a major role in slowing climate change. To have a better grasp of these processes is crucial to understand the ocean's role in the global climate system and to better foresee disruptions caused by the changing climate.          Digital models are among the most frequently used tools to do this. They represent the climate on a virtual planet earth, and are indispensable to explore past and predict future climate conditions, and to understand how our current climate works.The challenge of modeling the oceansThese models rely on a series of equations governing the main physical, chemical and biological phenomena shaping the world's climate. The difficulty of representing these forces comes from the complexity of simulating the physical and biological processes involved and how they interact with each other.As far as the physical geography of the oceans is concerned, the equations are fairly well known and defined. Improving models depends above all on higher resolution, limited for the moment by the processing capacity and storage space of our computers.When it comes to biological factors, however, there are lots of questions around how best to encode and simplify processes of the highest complexity. To boil it down: CO2 capture is principally regulated by phytoplankton. These microscopic algae live on the surface areas of the ocean and absorb CO2 via photosynthesis. When phytoplankton die, some of the organisms fall to the bottom of the ocean, providing a carbon store for hundreds, indeed thousands of years.To represent phytoplankton, one of the commonest approaches is to divide it into \"functional types\"\u2014that's to say distinct groups of phytoplankton which have significant features in common such as size or feeding strategy. This approach assumes each type can have a different impact on the carbon cycle and play a different role in the ecosystem.                Estimated nitrogen fixation rate for a day in November under average conditions. Each colour corresponds to a different type of diazotroph. Sometimes the bands overlap, indicating a mixture of diazotroph species. Credit: Domitille Louchard, Mar Benavides, Fourni par l'auteur             Diazotrophs\u2014allies of the climateOne type in particular, diazotrophs, are under the spotlight at the moment. These organisms, as their name indicates, use nitrogen (N2) molecules for their growth (etymologically speaking, for feeding, from the Greek word trophos). By transforming N2, diazotrophs provide nutrients that are essential to other phytoplankton and allow them to photosynthesise. They thus have a fundamental role as natural fertilizers of the ocean.Recent studies, in the field and the lab, have shown the great diversity of diazotrophs and their adaptation to different environments. For example, while it was previously thought diazotrophs were confined to warm, clear tropical waters, some unicellular diazotrophs have been discovered in Arctic seas or in the darkness of the deep ocean.For a long time, however, researchers have taken the view that diazotrophs contribute little to carbon sequestration, because Trichodesmium\u2014historically the most studied diazotroph\u2014tends to stay on the ocean surface and to be little subject to predation. But evidence has been gathered and shows other types of diazotroph (those involved in symbiosis with diatom algae) are involved in significant carbon flows toward the depths).Despite their importance, diazotrophs are often represented in a very sketchy way in digital models. This is a result of both our understanding of their physiology still being limited, and constraints in computing capacity\u2014when one adds complexity to the models, simulations take too long or need more powerful processors.Many international models, like those used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, still work on the basis of assuming that nitrogen is artificially added to the ocean's surface in certain conditions supposedly favorable to diazotrophs.Other models explicitly represent the nitrogen-fixing process, but restrict themselves to a single type of diazotroph with the characteristics of Trichodesmium. This is, however, a very reductive approach given scientific advances, and limits our capacity to capture the global distribution of microalgae, assess their impact on the rest of the ecosystem, and to predict the consequences of climate change both on phytoplankton and the carbon sequestration process.A year of surface nitrogen fixation using the new digital system developed within the Project NOTION framework.

Domitille Louchard, Mar Benavides, Fourni par l'auteurBetter representation of diazotrophs in digital modelsTo address these gaps, we've developed within the framework of project NOTION a brand new representation of diazotrophs, this time including three different types.If the equations describing diazotroph growth and mortality are the same, each type is distinguished from the others by specific factors, corresponding to how each type reacts to different temperatures, amount of sunlight or availability of nutrients.This innovative representation of diazotrophs has been integrated into a high-resolution digital model applied to the Atlantic Ocean\u2014a diazotroph hotspot.Accounting for the diversity of diazotrophs has resulted in an expansion of nitrogen fixing in digital models of the ocean, and closer accordance with field observations. Estimates of vertical carbon flows have also increased, notably in regions like the tropical West Atlantic, where diazotrophs in symbiosis with diatom algae flourish.The new model allows us to address understudied issues, such as competition between diazotrophs, but also to better understand the role microalgae play in the context of a changing planet. What is their importance as a source of nitrogen going to be for other producers at the bottom of the food chain? Can diazotrophs help limit the effects of climate change? The possibilities for further research opened up by this more realistic representation are huge.

  "text": "Scientists from St Andrews and Cardiff Universities, along with international colleagues, have discovered the source of warm super salty water that rushed up the Atlantic 15,000 years ago, ushering in the end of the last ice age.          The study, published in Nature, comes as ocean temperatures are reaching record highs and waters in the Atlantic and Southern Oceans become fresher due to ice sheet melt, which could further impact ocean circulation and global climate.The team measured the chemical fingerprints locked in microscopic fossil shells to reconstruct the temperature and salinity of the seawater in which the shells grew. By taking samples of these fossils going down a 40-meter-long core of deep-sea mud, they were able to fathom the history of ocean temperature and salinity during each ice age cycle of the last 1.5 million years.The results show that during the peak of each ice age, waters in the Indian Ocean became super charged with salt. The scientists show this was driven by a restriction of the fresh-water currents that usually enter the Indian Ocean from the Pacific, allowing the Indian Ocean to become saltier, like a giant salt pan.Lead author Sophie Nuber said, \"Under the hot sunshine of the subtropics, seawater evaporates and gets saltier. Typically in the Indian Ocean this salt is diluted by fresher waters flowing in from the Pacific, but during the ice ages this current was cut off by a drop in sea level, so the salt could build up undiluted.\"Sea level fell globally by as much as 120 meters during the ice ages, due to the locking up of water evaporated from the ocean in giant ice sheets. The team showsthat this process would have repeatedly cut off the fresh water currents that snake into the Indian Ocean through the Indonesian archipelago, as much of the seafloor in this region became land when water levels fell.The salty waters remained trapped in the Indian Ocean until the end of the last ice age, when a shift in winds and currents allowed them to burst into the Atlantic. This in turn helped re-establish the Atlantic current system that warms the UK and Northwest Europe from its weakened glacial state.Professor Steve Barker, one of the study authors, said, \"We discovered more than ten years ago that the end of the ice age saw a massive pulse in Atlantic currents, which helped usher in warmer inter-glacial conditions. Our new study shows that the salt that helped make these currents so dense and powerful was sourced from more than 10,000km away in the Indian Ocean.\"Warm salty currents continue to flow through the Atlantic today, yet are starting to weaken due to input of freshwater from melting ice sheets, which could trigger a series of knock-on climatic impacts.Dr. James Rae, from the University of St Andrews, said, \"Our work shows how different parts of the climate system are surprisingly inter-connected. Changes in circulation and salinity in one part of the ocean can have huge impacts on the other side of the planet, so we need to stop global warming to prevent further disruption to these critical circulation systems.\" More information:Sophie Nuber, Indian Ocean Salinity build-up primes Deglacial Ocean Circulation Recovery, Nature (2023).

  "text": "Around 500 million years ago life in the oceans rapidly diversified. In the blink of an eye\u2014at least in geological terms\u2014life transformed from simple, soft-bodied creatures to complex multicellular organisms with shells and skeletons.          Now, research led by the University of Cambridge has shown that the diversification of life at this time also led to a drastic change in the chemistry of Earth's crust\u2014the uppermost layer we walk on and, crucially, the layer which provides many of the nutrients essential to life. The study is published in the journal Science Advances.The researchers identified that, following the so-called Cambrian explosion, quantities of the life-giving nutrient phosphorus tripled in crustal rocks\u2014a change that supported the continued expansion of life on Earth.\"We found that ancient life had a profound impact on its environment\u2014even to the point of resetting the chemistry of the continental crust,\" said Craig Walton, lead author of the research who is from Cambridge's Department of Earth Sciences.Using a database of information on ancient rocks, which has been complied by scientists across the globe, the researchers built a map to show how the chemistry of Earth's crust has fluctuated over the last 3000 million years. They found that, following the increase in phosphorus at the time of the Cambrian explosion, contents of this key-nutrient in crustal rocks have continued to grow up until the present-day.\"From about 540 million years onwards, we see that life transformed the composition of the upper part of Earth's crust,\" said co-author Oliver Shorttle, who is jointly based at Cambridge's Department of Earth Sciences and Institute of Astronomy. \"This shows how the development of life can influence the growth of further life, and in turn how much life a planet can go on to support.\"Life in all its varied forms\u2014from the prodigious whale to minute plankton\u2014relies on six key ingredients: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur. The researchers investigated phosphorus because it is not only universally needed by life, but also difficult to tap into because it is locked up in minerals inside Earth's crust.      \"Phosphorus is also thought to be one of the nutrients that limits the amount of life that can exist in the oceans,\" said Shorttle. He explained that, by mapping out phosphorus in rocks through time, they could identify how much of this element is available to life, and, by extension, get an idea of how much life has existed on the planet.Unlike carbon and nitrogen, which are key constituents of our atmosphere, phosphorus must be extracted out of rocks before life can use it. The process starts with the break-down of rocks due to interactions with rainwater\u2014releasing phosphate which is then washed by rivers into the oceans. Once in the oceans, phosphorus is metabolized by organisms such as plankton or eukaryotic algae, which are then consumed by larger animals higher up the food chain.When these organisms die, most of the phosphorus is returned back into the oceans. This efficient recycling process is a key control on the amount of total phosphorus in the ocean, which in turn supports life, \"It enables us to have all the life we see around us today, so understanding when this process started is really key,\" said Walton.But, all of this biological reprocessing power relies on oxygen. This is what fuels the bacteria responsible for the breakdown of dead organic material that returns phosphorus back into the oceans.The researchers think that a surge in oxygen at around the time of the Cambrian explosion might explain why phosphorus increased in rocks. \"If oxygen did increase at that time, then more oxygen may have been available to break down deep sea biomass and recycle phosphorus to shallow coastal regions,\" said Walton. Moving this phosphorus back towards the land meant it was better preserved in rocks that make up the continents. \"That series of changes were ultimately responsible for fueling the activity of complex life as we know it,\" said Walton.But, he added, \"It's tricky to unravel the sequence of events\u2014whether complex life evolved in part because of increased supplies of oxygen and phosphorus to start with, or if they were in fact fully responsible for increasing availability of both, is still a controversial topic.\" Walton and the team are now looking to investigate the trigger for and timing of this phosphorus enrichment in the crust in more detail.

  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the most important question in assessing carbon cutting solutions?",
  "answer_squad": " Is it available now and ready to deploy?",
  "text": "With climate-enhanced droughts, heatwaves and fires ravaging three continents and the threat of a new surge in global warming, the world urgently needs to ramp-up solutions for slashing carbon pollution. But which solutions are most critical?          The organization Project Drawdown has detailed the potential, feasibility and cost of nearly a hundred climate solutions since it was set up in 2017.Executive director Jonathan Foley, a leading climate scientist, spoke to AFP about how to assess and prioritize the actions needed to keep Earth liveable.The following interview has been edited for length and flow:Q: What are the three most important questions in assessing the usefulness and integrity of carbon-cutting solutions?A: Is it available now and ready to deploy? Because we need to start bending the emissions curve immediately.Is it cost-effective? Otherwise, it's not going to scale effectively.Does it create co-benefits for people, especially in terms of health, jobs, equity, and justice? This will make it far more appealing.Q: A lot of hope\u2014and investment\u2014is going into technological solutions such as filtering fossil fuel pollution or pulling CO2 out of the air. Comment?A: While some very limited carbon removal will be needed by mid-century, the vast, vast majority of the work we need to do\u2014more than 95 percent\u2014is cutting emissions, and doing it now.Of the five percent focused on carbon removal, I think it should be more than 90 percent nature-based removal, such as ecological restoration and regenerative agriculture. Machine-based removal is unlikely to work at any meaningful scale.Q: We often hear that solutions are already available, all that's missing is political will. Is that it?                'Governments aren't leading, not at all. At best, they're followers,' says Foley\u00a0.             A: It's not political will. It's money and power, which right now is still with fossil fuels, polluting industries, and unsustainable agriculture. That's why too many politicians are still in bed with them.But effective climate solutions are here, now, and they are starting to growing exponentially and beat the older, polluting systems at their own game\u2014in the marketplace. When renewables and other climate solutions are cheaper, better, faster, and more popular than the old systems, we will hit a dramatic tipping point on climate solutions. We are getting close to that now. It's finally a real race.      Q: Government, business, consumers -\u2013 who's not pulling their weight on climate action?A: The climate crisis will be changed in culture and business and technology, not politics. Governments aren't leading, not at all. At best, they're followers.Government regulation has been a very small contributor. So far, businesses and communities are leading on climate action. We have already seen dramatic reductions in emissions\u201420 percent in the US since peaking in 2007, and 40 percent since the mid-1990s in the UK\u2014in major economies around the world, fuelled by changes in technology, business, investment, and culture.Activists have also contributed to these positive changes, largely pushing how businesses and investors see the climate problem.Q: Is greenwashing the new climate denial?A: Sadly, yes. Outright denial of climate change as an issue is no longer credible. So the new approach is focused on delay and greenwashing\u2014making it look like we are doing things, but nothing really changes. One could also say delay is the new denial.But we should also be aware of \"doom-washing\": the narrative that nothing good is happening on climate change and that we have no hope to stop the climate crisis. Neither of these is true.Q: Is mainstream media conveying the balanced portfolio of climate action needed?A: No. Far too much of the coverage is focused on the problem and impacts of climate change\u2014roughly 99 percent in the US media\u2014and almost nothing focusing on the solutions.Mainstream media is doing more harm than good in some cases by promoting more fear and anxiety, leading to disengagement and inaction. This feeds a terrible feedback loop in our broken politics and activists cultures. We need a better, more balanced conversation on how climate solutions can benefit communities around the world.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:World near positive 'tipping point' on climate solutions: expert (2023, May 10)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-world-positive-climate-solutions-expert.html  This document is subject to copyright.

Local leaders said during a town hall and a media event Tuesday that residents would have to leave by 6 p.m. on Friday but could return to the village from time to time starting Saturday, depending on the risk level, but not stay overnight.The centuries-old village straddles German- and Romansch-speaking parts of the eastern Graubunden region, sitting southwest of Davos at an altitude of about 1,150 meters (about 3,800 feet). Today it has under 100 residents.The mountain and the rocks on it have been moving since the last Ice Age, local officials say. But measurements indicated a \"strong acceleration over a large area\" in recent days, and \"up to 2 million cubic meters of rock material will collapse or slide in the coming seven to 24 days,\" officials said.Over the last century, the village itself has moved a few centimeters (inches) each year, but the movement sped up over the last 20 years. The landslide has been moving about 1 meter (about 3 feet) per year. Geological surveys suggest the situation has become even more precarious.

The landslide could also move slowly.But there's also a 10% chance that the whole 2-million-cubic meter mass may tumble down, threatening lives, property and the village itself, he said.\"We hope that the village stays intact,\" Gartmann said by phone. \"We can't eliminate the possibility that it (the rock) will come down. ... It could damage the village or destroy it.\"Gartmann said glacier melt had affected the precariousness of the rocks over millennia but that melting glaciers due to \"man-made\" climate change in recent decades wasn't a factor.

  "text": "A new study published in Nature Geoscience carried out by Ca' Foscari University of Venice, in collaboration with the Institute of Polar Sciences of the National Research Council and other international partners, shows that mercury levels in the Arctic are strongly influenced by climate change.          According to the study, the sea ice melting following temperature increase during the last glacial-interglacial transition caused a higher release of mercury into the atmosphere. In addition, the replacement of multi-year sea ice with seasonal ice, which is more saline, promotes complex chemical reactions that promote the deposition of this element in polar regionsMercury, a global pollutant that is especially toxic to health and the environment, is the focus of the new Italian-led study.Scientists from Ca' Foscari University of Venice and the Institute of Polar Sciences of the National Research Council (Cnr-Isp), in collaboration with other international partners, examined the relationship between past climate variations with mercury levels in the Arctic to understand what natural factors influence the biogeochemical cycling of this element.In the context of the East GReenland Ice core Project (EastGRIP) coordinated by the Centre for Ice and Climate in Copenhagen, the research team carried out the analysis of an ice core extracted from the Greenland ice sheet, observing the dynamics of mercury between 9,000 and 16,000 years ago, during the transition from the Last Glacial Period to the current climate stage, the Holocene. The results show that mercury levels during this transition were strongly influenced by the reduction of sea ice coverage.\"Our study shows that mercury deposition in the Arctic tripled at the beginning of the Holocene compared to the Last Glacial Period,\" explains Delia Segato, the lead author and a Ph.D. student in Science and Management of Climate Change at Ca' Foscari University of Venice.\"Thanks to the analysis and interpretation of paleoclimatic archives and the development of an atmospheric mercury chemistry model,\" Segato continues, \"the study concluded that the loss of sea ice, especially the perennial one, in the subpolar Atlantic Ocean due to climate warming 11,700 years ago was the main cause of the increase of mercury deposition in the Arctic.\"Mercury emissions, carefully monitored at the international level, are not only of anthropogenic origin. The biogeochemical cycle of mercury is controlled also by several natural sources, such as volcanic activities, as well as a multitude of physical, chemical, and biological processes that occur in the soil, ocean, and atmosphere.\"In polar regions, sea ice plays a fundamental role in controlling these processes,\" explains Andrea Spolaor, a researcher at the Institute of Polar Sciences in Venice and corresponding author of the paper. \"In fact, it has been shown that perennial sea ice, often several meters in thickness, impedes the transfer of mercury from the ocean to the atmosphere, which would otherwise occur due to the volatility of this metal.\"\"On the contrary, seasonal sea ice, being thinner, more permeable, and more saline, allows mercury transfer and promotes complex atmospheric reactions involving bromine and increases the frequency of atmospheric mercury depletion events, causing more rapid deposition in the Arctic environment,\" concludes Spolaor.\"Due to the present-day climate warming, the extent of perennial sea ice in the Arctic has decreased by more than 50% compared to the beginning of satellite measurements in the 1970s. Future studies will help us estimate how this phenomenon will impact mercury levels and what are the associated risks for Arctic populations and ecosystems.\" More information:Delia Segato et al, Arctic mercury flux increased through the Last Glacial Termination with a warming climate, Nature Geoscience (2023).

  "answer_race": " To inform readers of the new findings.",
  "question_squad": " What is the most critical property of black carbon?",
  "answer_squad": " its refractive index",
  "text": "Our industrialized society releases many and various pollutants into the world. Combustion in particular produces aerosol mass including black carbon. Although this only accounts for a small percentage of aerosol particles, black carbon is especially problematic due to its ability to absorb heat and impede the heat reflection capabilities of surfaces such as snow. So, it's essential to know how black carbon interacts with sunlight. Researchers have quantified the refractive index of black carbon to the most accurate degree yet, which may impact climate models.          There are many factors driving climate change; some are very familiar, such as carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels, sulfur dioxide from cement manufacture or methane emissions from animal agriculture. Black carbon aerosol particles, also from combustion, are less covered in the news but are particularly important.Essentially soot, black carbon is very good at absorbing heat from sunlight and storing it, adding to atmospheric heat. At the same time, given that dark colors are less effective at reflecting light and therefore heat, as black carbon covers lighter surfaces including snow, it reduces the potential of those surfaces to reflect heat back into space.\"Understanding the interaction between black carbon and sunlight is of fundamental importance in climate research,\" said Assistant Professor Nobuhiro Moteki from the Department of Earth and Planetary Science at the University of Tokyo.\"The most critical property of black carbon in this regard is its refractive index, basically how it redirects and disperses incoming light rays. However, existing measurements of black carbon's refractive index were inaccurate. My team and I undertook detailed experiments to improve this. With our improved measurements, we now estimate that current climate models may be underestimating the absorption of solar radiation due to black carbon by a significant 16%.\"                Transmission electron microscope images of ambient aerosols collected by an aerosol-impactor sampler installed on the research vessel Shinsei Maru. Red arrows indicate individual black carbon aggregates, most of which were mixed with sulfate (green arrows) and/or organic materials (light blue arrows). Credit: Moteki et al. CC-BY             Previous measurements of the optical properties of black carbon were often confounded by factors such as a lack of pure samples or difficulties in measuring light interactions with particles of differing complex shapes. Moteki and his team improved this situation by capturing the black carbon particles in water, then isolating them with sulfates or other water-soluble chemicals. By isolating the particles, the team was better able to analyze the way they scatter, which gave researchers the data to calculate the value of refractive index. The paper is published in the journal Aerosol Science and Technology.      \"We measured the amplitude, or strength, and phase, or step, of the light scattered from black carbon samples isolated in water,\" said Moteki. \"This allowed us to calculate what is known as the complex refractive index of black carbon. Complex because rather than being a single number, it's a value that contains two parts, one of which is 'imaginary' (concerned with absorption), though its impact is very, very real. Such complex numbers with imaginary components are actually very common in the field of optical science and beyond.\"Because the new optical measurements of black carbon imply that current climate models are underestimating its contribution to atmospheric warming, the team hopes that other climate researchers and policymakers can make use of their findings. The method developed by the team to ascertain the complex refractive index of particles can be applied to materials other than black carbon. This allows for the optical identification of unknown particles in the atmosphere, ocean or ice cores, and the evaluation of optical properties of powdered materials, not just those related to the ongoing problem of climate change.

  "answer_race": " Critical.",
  "question_squad": " What did the paper say the amount of CO2 released by bottom trawling was similar to?",
  "answer_squad": " the CO2 created by the global airline industry",
  "text": "A paper published in Nature today refutes the findings of a paper by Sala et al on the amount of CO2 released from the seabed by bottom trawling. The paper made significant headlines around the world when it was released in 2021, as it equated the carbon released by bottom trawling to be of a similar magnitude to the CO2 created by the global airline industry.          In their paper quantifying the carbon benefits of ending bottom trawling, Prof. Jan Hiddink of Bangor University's School of Ocean Science and others, explain that the methodology used in the original paper was far too simplistic and vastly overestimates carbon emissions. In calculating the CO2 released by bottom trawling, the paper modeled the amount of carbon that would be disturbed, and they assumed that most of this would be converted into CO2. However, the majority of this organic carbon on the seabed would decompose and be released as CO2 regardless of whether it is disturbed by bottom trawling. Hiddink and colleagues therefore show that only a very small fraction of seabed carbon reacts to trawling disturbance.\"The carbon benefits of ending bottom trawling have been massively overstated in this paper,\" Hiddink explains. \"While bottom trawling undoubtably disrupts the natural carbon fluxes and disturbs the bottom-dwelling sea life, seabed carbon flows are highly complex and need further research.\"Questioning whether the estimates in the paper were realistic, Hiddink reviewed 49 other studies on the measured CO2 differences before and after trawling, and the findings were varied, with 60% of the papers finding no significant effect, 29% finding lower organic carbon and 10% finding more. If the findings of Sala et al were correct, surely these massive and significant numbers would be reflected in these studies?Hiddink argues that the Sala paper has confounded the fresh carbon in the top layer, which would be quickly released by natural processes in any case, with the much less reactive carbon stored in the deeper sediment. As the surface layer carbon will be converted to CO2 in any case, assuming it is affected by trawling makes no sense, and massively inflates the estimated CO2 emissions.Hiddink suggests a figure that is a factor 100 to 1,000 times lower than calculated in the Sala paper for the amount of carbon released by trawling would be more appropriate.\"We don't know enough about what bottom trawling does to seabed carbon stores to be able to make robust global estimates about the effects of bottom trawling,\" says Hiddink.\"Using these figures is worrying, as many governments and others are proposing banning bottom trawling and using the 'carbon credits' to offset other activities, but if the carbon emissions are overestimated by several orders of magnitude, we risk increasing overall CO2  emissions while reducing the global food supply.\" More information:Jan Hiddink, Quantifying the carbon benefits of ending bottom trawling, Nature (2023).

The extent of the fires and their appearance so early in the year illustrate the impacts of climate change, scientists say.\"We've already had 390,000 hectares (963,710 acres) burned. So it's already 10 times the typical fire year and we're really just getting started,\" said Danielle Smith, premier of Alberta province where a state of emergency was declared.\"It's an extraordinary (and) unprecedented event, which is I think what we have to be prepared for in future,\" she told reporters on Tuesday.Around 30,000 people have been ordered to evacuate their homes while hundreds of firefighters work to control the flames.\"It is an exceptional year insofar as the accumulation of burned areas is very rapid, as is the number of very large fires at the same time,\" Yan Boulanger, a specialist in forest fires at the Canadian ministry for natural resources, told AFP.The vast majority of fires are of human origin, including cigarette butts, campfires that weren't properly snuffed out or sometimes malicious acts, he said.'Dangerous' month of MaySpring is a risky time for fires in the area, as no snow remains on the ground and it's before plants turn green.\"We end up with very dry undergrowth and trees that are also very flammable, because they have no leaves,\" said Boulanger, who noted that the conditions in recent weeks \"have been very dry.\"Terri Lang, a meteorologist for Environment Canada, said that dry conditions make spring a \"dangerous time.\"In early May, a weather phenomenon set in that \"brought really unseasonably hot and dry conditions to the province,\" Lang told AFP.A ridge of high pressure pushed aside the precipitation and kept the heat in place, breaking several temperature records in the region.In the provincial capital of Edmonton, the mercury reached 28.9 degrees Celsius (84 degrees Fahrenheit) on May 1, beating the previous all-time high of 26.7C (80F) set almost a century ago. Farther north, it reached 32.2C (89.9F) in Fort McMurray on Thursday.Added to this were strong winds fueled by the typical temperature differential between the cold north and the warmer south.\"It was a perfect storm,\" said Lang.Boulanger added that \"if the conditions remain extreme, it could last for weeks or months.\"A previous major fire in 2016 disrupted production in the oil sands region near Fort McMurray, pummelling the nation's economy.That fire took almost a year to be put out, Boulanger said.More common with global warmingDiana Stralberg, a researcher in Edmonton for the Canadian Forest Service, explained that human-caused climate change is making the fire season longer and causing \"extreme fire weather conditions\" to occur more often.\"Although fire is a natural, forest-renewing process, more frequent fires, as well as fires followed by droughts, can interrupt regeneration of conifer trees\" and lead to a withdrawal of wooded areas in favor of grasslands, the climate specialist told AFP.Little by little, the forest is being nibbled away, with direct consequences for dozens of species of migratory birds and caribou.\"Modeling of future fire and vegetation conditions has shown that, in Alberta, up to 50 percent of upland boreal forests could be at risk of conversion to grassland systems by the end of the 21st century under high-end warming scenarios,\" said Stralberg.More and more fires also lead to the massive emissions of greenhouse gases, further exacerbating climate change, in a mechanism researchers call the \"fire-climate feedback loop.\"    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:'Perfect storm' of heat, dryness fuel western Canada's extreme wildfires (2023, May 10)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-storm-dryness-fuel-western-canada.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "question_squad": " How many weather balloons are launched each day?",
  "answer_squad": " four",
  "text": "Hundreds of miles north of the Arctic Circle, Sandia National Laboratories researchers ensure the collection of important weather and climate data. By switching the gas used in their weather balloons, they have reduced their metaphorical footprint on the fragile Arctic ecosystem.          More than three years ago, the Sandia-operated atmospheric measurement facility in Alaska switched from launching helium-filled weather balloons to launching weather balloons filled with hydrogen produced on-site. Since then, they have launched nearly 5,000 hydrogen balloons with minimal issues.This switch greatly reduces the transportation cost and emissions of shipping helium to Utqia\u0121vik, formerly known as Barrow, the northernmost city in the U.S. and site of the North Slope of Alaska atmospheric measurement facility.The observatory, operated by Sandia for the Department of Energy Office of Science's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement user facility, has collected weather and climate data, including specialized data on Arctic clouds, for more than 25 years. ARM's data are freely available to researchers at universities and national laboratories, and are vital for refining climate models, especially those of the rapidly warming Arctic.The switch from non-renewable helium to hydrogen was made possible by a partnership between the National Weather Service and the DOE. The National Weather Service provided the electrolysis equipment, which uses electricity to turn water into hydrogen gas and oxygen gas, and provided regular maintenance of the equipment. In exchange, the ARM facility operated by Sandia launches two weather balloons a day for the weather service.\"Between Utqia\u0121vik and Oliktok Point, a long-term ARM mobile deployment that ended operations in 2021, we were the largest users of helium in the state of Alaska,\" said Fred Helsel, the systems engineer who led the effort to ensure the switch was safe and smooth. \"The National Weather Service has been great to work with.\"Ensuring a safe launchThis switch from helium to hydrogen is not without safety concerns\u2014hydrogen is famously flammable, and helium is not\u2014but Helsel worked with the National Weather Service, his division's environment, safety and health coordinator, Sandia fire protection and pressure safety, the ARM user facility and the automated balloon launcher manufacturer to reduce the risks.\"Hydrogen is gaining traction as a green energy resource and is a cleaner alternative to traditional fossil fuels for transportation,\" said Andrew Glen, manager of Sandia's atmospheric sciences research group. \"This project uses hydrogen in a different manner, utilizing its lighter-than-air properties to launch balloons. It is in the interest of the nation and the world for us to reduce our dependence on a fossil fuel byproduct, helium, and reduce our carbon footprint by not transporting helium cylinders to the site.\"One of the safety measures the team put in place includes ensuring that the hydrogen storage tank is outside the building where the electrolysis equipment operates. This has reduced the amount of flammable gas available inside the building to meet national safety codes and Sandia's requirements, Helsel said. Some of the National Weather Service sites that had already switched to hydrogen stored the tanks separately from the generator, but Sandia's safety analysis did encourage the service to tweak their design for subsequent site upgrades, he added.Sandia has been using an automated balloon launcher for more than a decade, but it occasionally has technical issues. When this happens, Utqia\u0121vik-based observers fill the ARM weather balloons with a backup supply of helium and launch them by hand. The facility does not have safety approvals in place to manually fill and launch a balloon with hydrogen, Helsel added.Safety is also inherent within the automated balloon launcher. The balloon is filled with gas inside a launch tube that keeps the hydrogen outside of the launch building, Helsel said. And the launch tube has fans that ensure hydrogen cannot build up inside it, even if a balloon leaks or bursts during the inflation process.      Saving money and the environmentThe first official hydrogen balloon was launched from Utqia\u0121vik on December 16, 2019, at 2:01 p.m. local time, said Helsel, with nearly 5,000 launches since then with only minimal issues. The original automated balloon launcher was replaced last August with a newer model.The Utqia\u0121vik site launches four weather balloons a day, two for the National Weather Service and two for ARM. Each weather balloon carries a special package of sensors tens of thousands of feet into the stratosphere to collect and transmit data on atmospheric pressure, temperature and humidity. The data from the National Weather Service balloons, which are launched every 12 hours, are used for weather forecasting. The data from the ARM balloons, which are launched six hours later, are used for atmospheric and climate research, Helsel said.The facility in Utqia\u0121vik used to spend about $60,000 per year on helium and shipping costs for the ARM weather balloons, Helsel said. However, with the current helium shortage and inflation, the total saved in the past three and a half years due to the switch could easily be more than $200,000.Much of the bulk material shipped to Utqia\u0121vik comes on a yearly barge from Anchorage, Glen said. \"One ship, once a year,\" he added. \"If it's not on that, it has to come on an aircraft.\" And shipping large, compressed gas cylinders by air comes with a sizable carbon footprint on top of the emissions released from processing helium, he said.Other ARM sites elsewhere in the U.S. are assessing whether it makes sense to also switch from helium\u2014a byproduct of the oil and gas industry\u2014to on-site or locally produced hydrogen, Glen said.\"The Arctic is a very tight-knit community, so keeping those relationships between the National Weather Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ARM, Sandia and the I\u00f1upiaq people of Utqiagvik together is critical for getting things done up there,\" Glen said.\"The Arctic is a tipping point for climate change. We're seeing four times the increase in temperature in the Arctic than in the rest of the U.S. The data from the ARM site are important for the long-term record and for climate models to take those changes into account.\" Provided bySandia National LaboratoriesCitation:Researchers switch from helium to hydrogen weather balloons (2023, May 9)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-helium-hydrogen-weather-balloons.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_squad": " large volume torsion apparatus",
  "text": "Philip Skemer, associate department chair and professor of Earth and planetary sciences, and graduate student Charis Horn, both in Arts & Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, have published a study in Geophysical Research Letters that showcases the power and potential of the large volume torsion (LVT) apparatus.          This WashU-built device can squeeze and twist rocks with 100 tons of force and temperatures of 1,300 degrees Celsius (2,500 degrees Fahrenheit). \"There are no other devices with the same capabilities anywhere else on the planet,\" Skemer said.Skemer's lab now has two LVT devices, each standing 8 feet tall and weighing about 5,000 pounds. The LVTs were designed to experimentally reproduce how rocks deform in parts of the Earth that are subject to high pressure and temperature, including deep within faults where tectonic plates meet.In the latest study, Horn and Skemer used the device to test talc, an extremely soft mineral that is commonly found in active, earthquake-prone faults.Experiments with the LVTs showed an unexpected result: When pressed hard enough, the layers in the mineral form ripples, much like rumpled carpet. Those ripples create small pockets of empty space called ripplocations, features that were unknown to scientists a decade ago. \"We're pushing on the talc from all sides with an enormous amount of force,\" Skemer said. \"You would not expect that to create a void.\"                Schematic of a hot subduction zone. Temperature contours are from Currie et\u00a0al.\u00a0(2004). The pale gray region represents the downgoing slab, with depths dominated by different seismic regimes highlighted atop the slab. The yellow star indicates the pressure at which our experiments were conducted. The maximum depth of talc is assumed to follow the 800\u00b0C isotherm (highlighted in yellow), since in a hot subduction environment talc stability will be exceeded before it reaches its maximum pressure limit (Pawley & Wood,\u00a01995). Earthquake depths are from Schwartz and Rokosky\u00a0(2007) and Hyndman et\u00a0al.\u00a0(1997).             This is the first time researchers have seen these structures in talc, and their discovery could change geophysicists' understanding of how certain classes of mineral responds to stress deep underground. \"It's important because the tiny spaces might give water a place to permeate the rocks, which could change the mechanical properties of the rocks,\" Skemer said.Skemer and Horn suspect that talc may play a surprising role in the movements of faults. The new paper postulates that talc and its ripplocations might encourage \"slow slip events,\" which are relatively slow movements that happen along the surfaces of faults, and that are detected using GPS and seismological techniques. At this time, however, it's not clear how they might affect the sudden movements closer to the surface that cause earthquakes.Skemer cautions that his research doesn't make it any easier to pinpoint where and when earthquakes might occur. \"Our goal is not to predict earthquakes,\" he said. \"We study the physical properties of geologic materials to better understand processes that affect the evolution of planets.\" More information:C.

  "answer_squad": " carbon storage",
  "text": "A team of researchers at Aalto University has developed a new tool to help urban planners keep urban developments in line with climate goals. The tool provides a metric that planners can use to improve carbon-neutral planning of urban growth, which is essential for meeting carbon emission targets.          Urban growth commonly encroaches on forested areas and agricultural land. This means that cities consume carbon sinks as they grow, which makes it harder for municipalities and countries to reach the net-zero emissions targets that are vital to avoid a climate catastrophe. The new metric, called the carbon storage (CS) factor, reflects how much carbon can be captured in planned urban developments. It is described in a paper published in Environmental Research Letters.The CS factor enables urban planners to evaluate how a new development will affect the city's carbon balance. By comparing the amount of storage capacity lost (for example, from deforestation) with the CS factor of development plans that use different approaches and technologies, planners can ensure that urban development maintains or even restores the region's natural carbon storage capacity.\"There are many tools available to increase the CS factor. Increasing wooden construction is a good option in some regions, but it's also possible to store carbon in the soil using biochar and other tools, or to include new fast-growing plants in the landscape, or even through direct carbon capture and storage technologies. We hope planners will adopt this mindset and use the CS factor to help them plan sustainable urban growth,\" says Aalto Professor Seppo Junnila, who led the study.The researchers used the CS factor to evaluate how wooden construction in Finland's capital region could compensate for deforestation from urban growth. They found that using the right kind of wooden construction technologies would mean that as much as 70% of future construction could preserve the lost forest's carbon storage capacity. This would require using methods that store significant amounts of carbon, such as log or cross-laminated timber.The study also showed that similar results could be obtained using wooden construction elsewhere in Europe, Asia and Oceania. However, the researchers stress that increased wooden construction is only a sustainable choice if forests are sustainably managed.\"Our goal isn't to encourage cities to expand into new areas but to provide planners with tools to mitigate the impact of development on carbon storage when forest clearing is unavoidable,\" says Junnila.

  "text": "Geothermal energy, found in subsurface hot dry rocks, is a viable option instead of fossil fuels. Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) enable us to use the plentiful amounts of energy in the hot rocks. The optimization and risk management of this process necessitate the accurate predictions of long-term thermal performance under different scenarios, which are usually done through numerical modeling.          Rock thermal parameters such as thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity must be accurately determined for reliable numerical model input. These parameters often experience variations because of the reduction of temperature when recovering heat\u2014something which has been proven by multiple studies. Nonetheless, most existing numerical models tend to neglect these variations.To that end, a team of researchers from Peking University investigated the effect of temperature-dependent rock thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity on the thermal performance of an EGS model.\"Previous experimental studies on different types of rocks indicate that when temperatures are reduced in an EGS, rock thermal properties change significantly,\" said Hui Wu, lead investigator of this study. \"Our goal is to find out how these changes affect the long-term thermal performance of the EGS. We believe the results can be used to guide future numerical studies.\"The team demonstrated that on one hand, the increase of thermal conductivity caused by temperature reduction accelerates thermal conduction from rock formations to fracture fluid, which improves thermal performance. On the other hand, temperature reduction impairs the thermal performance, but the impact is smaller than that of an increase in thermal conductivity.Their findings are published in Rock Mechanics Bulletin.\"An interesting point to note is that, while thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity have contrasting impacts on EGS thermal performance, their combination effect is minimal,\" said Yu. \"Mainly, the thermal performance is determined by the product of rock thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity.\"\"Apparently, keeping a constant rock thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity measured at room temperature can accurately forecast the EGS model's thermal performance,\" added Yu.

  "question_squad": " What is Nigeria's climate change loss and damage fund?",
  "answer_squad": " Severe Weather Forecasting Demonstration Project",
  "text": "Nigeria is one of the most flood-prone countries in west Africa. Many areas experience annual flooding. This happens during heavy rainfall and one of the reasons is poor drainage systems.          The country therefore needs to make improvements. As researchers who have specialized in meteorology for about two decades we believe there are several ways it can do this. The key interventions needed are:understanding the impact of climate change on rainfall extremes and water resourcesinvesting in a functional weather forecast system addressing the problem of poor drainage.These actions are necessary to build resilience to floods.The Nigeria Meteorological Agency and the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency have predicted severe flooding this year. And recent devastating flooding incidents are still fresh in the minds of Nigerians.Flooding in NigeriaFlash floods are considered the deadliest hazards related to extreme weather. Nigeria is increasingly prone to them.There are many predictors of floods, chief of which is increasingly heavy rains over the west African Sahel.In recent decades parts of Nigeria have experienced summer rainfall extremes that are more intense than before. Even dry regions like the Lake Chad River basin have begun to have record rainfalls. Downpours have submerged land areas, overrun watersheds and threatened the carrying capacity of water reservoirs.This is expected to get worse as a result of global warming, according to a recent scientific study by the World Weather Attribution scientific team.The atmospheric rivers linked to the recent heavy rainfall over the region are associated with a warmer north Atlantic and Mediterranean. The warming is connected with sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Pacific Ocean, described as Trans-Atlantic-Pacific Ocean Dipole.Studies have also shown that La Ni\u00f1a events, periodically cool ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific. The cooling is coupled with changes in winds and pressure that cause increased rainfall over the west African Sahel. More disturbing is the rare \"triple-dip\" La Ni\u00f1a climate event. Three consecutive years of these events will trigger more rainfall than normal in some regions.The second set of drivers is geographical. For example low-land and coastal areas are flood risk areas because of rising river levels. Previous flood disasters have shown that these areas are disaster prone.Thirdly, flooding in Nigeria is made worse by the poor management of drainage systems. The combination of heavy rains and nonexistent or poor drainage system increases the likelihood of flash floods in cities.Adding to the problem are poor waste disposal, poor urban planning, tarmacking of urban roads and construction of drainage systems without climate adaptation in mind.      Building resilience against floodsThere's no way to influence rainfall variability, especially in the short term. But green engineering can help protect humans and the environment.There are two strategies that Nigeria can easily use. They are proper dam management and tree planting. These initiatives will reduce the speed of water flow and reduce the impact of floods.Another easy intervention is the process of risk mapping, assessment and planning for floods. This informs how resources should be distributed and how to reduce risk. It has been successful in countries such as Romania and Bulgaria.Then there is forecasting. It is a complex process that is continually being improved as artificial intelligence and machine learning are incorporated into the prediction technologies. Capacity building is required to improve the reliability of forecasting in the country.Both the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency and the Nigerian Meteorology Agency provide timely precipitation forecasts for water-related disaster management. The World Meteorological Organization has supported forecasting services in west Africa through its Severe Weather Forecasting Demonstration Project. The project would be more beneficial if it operated in all meteorological centers across the country.For weather forecasting to deliver quality data, there is a need to continuously invest in equipment and review performance. For instance, the NigeriaSat-2 was built to provide high-resolution imagery of the Earth's surface but it's past its design life.Drainage systems can be developed and improved by channels or ditches, and piping that directs excess rainwater and sewage to a point of disposal. Sustainable urban drainage systems are becoming common given their multiple benefits such as reducing the effects of pollution.Lastly, financing has stood out as a challenge. Nigeria's government needs to make good use of the climate change loss and damage fund that was established at the COP27 meeting. Access to the funding depends on having systems for data collection, recording and reporting of loss and damage finance needs.Avoiding a repeat of disasterPast floods are still fresh in people's minds. In 2012, the destructive effect of the excess water released from the Lagdo Reservoir in northern Cameroon and torrential summer rainfall killed 400 people, displaced millions of others, and destroyed over 152,575 hectares of farmland in Nigeria. The Nigerian Emergency Management Agency) estimated a total economic loss to be about US$16.9 billion.In 2022, the flooding caused over 600 deaths and affecting an estimated 3.2 million people across 34 of the country's 36 states. The floods destroyed over 569,251 hectares of farmland.As the 2023 flooding approaches, it is important for federal government and state agencies to work in coordination, following the seasonal climate forecast updates issued by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency. As a matter of urgency, states should set up local disaster management committees to assist in creating awareness and relocating communities living in flood-prone areas.

  "text": "A recent study calculated new projections for mean sea level rise on the Finnish coast by 2100. In the worst-case scenario, the sea level in Helsinki would rise by more than half a meter.          The sea level is rising at an increasing rate due to the melting of glaciers and ice sheets caused by global warming and the thermal expansion of sea water. In Finland, the phenomenon of land uplift protects the coast from rising sea levels, but in the future, the speed of land uplift will not be enough to completely compensate for sea level rise. The coastal flood risk is expected to increase, particularly on the southern coast of Finland, by the end of the century.The newly published joint study between the Finnish Meteorological Institute and Aalto University has calculated new projections for future mean sea level in Finland by 2100. Sea level rise will increase flood risks on Finland's southern coast in the coming decades. On the coast of the Bothnian Bay, the rate of land uplift is faster, but there too, the decline in sea level will slow down.However, the greatest effects of sea level rise will only be felt after 2100. If we do not succeed in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, sea level may rise by several meters over the following centuries. Such a great increase would have significant impacts in Finland as well. The work is published in the journal Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences.Emission trends affect future projectionsThe new projections are based on extensive international research data and climate model results. In addition to rising sea levels and land uplift, they have taken into account special characteristics of the Baltic Sea region, such as the effect of changes in the wind climate on water exchange between the Baltic Sea and the Atlantic Ocean in the Danish straits.The projections have been calculated for three different emission scenarios representing different future pathways of how greenhouse gas emissions by humanity may develop. If global emissions could be mitigated quickly, the sea level in Helsinki would rise by about 9 cm by the end of this century. The corresponding figure under the medium emission scenario would be 25 cm and under the high emission scenario 54 cm.On the coast of the Bothnian Bay, land uplift is stronger, so in Vaasa, for example, according to the most probable scenario, the sea level is not yet expected to rise during this century.Glaciers and ice sheets may melt faster than expectedThere are major uncertainties associated with the projections of sea level rise, especially as regards the melting of the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. The melting of Greenland would only have a minor effect on the sea level in Finland, as the change in the gravity field related to the melting of glaciers and ice sheets overrules the rise in the proximity of where it takes place. The melting of Antarctica, on the other hand, would have a full effect in our region.The possibility of the glaciers and ice sheets of West Antarctica melting faster than expected cannot be completely ruled out. Therefore, the new sea level rise projections have been calculated comprehensively for different probability distributions so that the possibility of higher sea level rise can also be taken into account in high-risk applications.

  "text": "With climate change making extreme weather events more frequent and intense, Maryland homeowners are increasingly faced with the threat of costly home damage\u2014from flooded ground floors to unwanted skylights from windblown fallen trees.          To help property owners and other stakeholders plan for those rainy (or drought-stricken) days, University of Maryland finance Professor of the Practice Clifford Rossi developed the Homeowner Financial Vulnerability Index (HFVI), which categorizes the risk of weather-related damage for Maryland homeowners.The index identifies regions in the state where residents are most likely to feel financial strain from getting hit with an unexpectedly large out-of-pocket expense.Rossi, a risk management industry veteran, said identifying these pockets of vulnerability is critical for tailoring targeted financial products and services to help homeowners, and for policymakers and government agencies to determine where public investments in weather resiliency projects are most needed.The index incorporates Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data for every loan originated in Maryland for 2021, plus loan-level credit performance data from government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The study also uses data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Risk Index. FEMA's calculations are composed of three factors: expected annual losses from 18 types of natural hazards at the county or U.S. Census tract level; a measure of a community's ability to deal with a natural hazard, based on factors like capital and infrastructure; and a social vulnerability score, taking into account poverty, vehicles access, household crowding and other metrics.In Maryland, the most threatening hazards are drought, tornadoes and coastal flooding, but Rossi found that the vast majority of tracts in the state have relatively moderate or low risk.According to Rossi's index, only four areas in Maryland have very high combined hazard risk and financial vulnerability, while 30 more than tracts fall into the next-highest risk category. Areas with the most risk are clustered on Maryland's Eastern Shore, with some others on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay.\"These areas are some of the least densely populated areas in the state, where agriculture and fishing are major industries,\" Rossi wrote in the new study. They also have low minority populations relative to more populous areas of Maryland.The index can help target federal, state and local funding for shoreline protection or flood control measures in places they'll help the most, and give insurers and mortgage providers information to come up with innovative products for individual homeowners in high-risk areas.\"Current and prospective homeowners living in high hazard risk areas will need new products and services to help them understand and manage the physical and financial risks they face from extreme weather events now and in the future,\" Rossi said. \"For new homeowners, having tools that help identify the physical risks of their area is critical before making a purchase.\"Current homeowners can also benefit from guidance in the index about taking advantage of forward-looking tools that can provide them with perspectives on hazards happening not just this year, but in future decades.For instance, adjustable balance mortgages can incentivize proactive investments in projects to shore up homes to make them more resilient to weather extremes, Rossi said. Other financial products could also be developed to provide relief to homeowners facing post-disaster renovations and repairs not covered by insurance, Rossi said.

  "question_squad": " What is the term for the stronger warming taking place over the Arctic?",
  "answer_squad": " Arctic Amplification",
  "text": "A robust phenomenon termed the Arctic Amplification (AA) refers to the stronger warming taking place over the Arctic compared to the global mean. The AA in the Arctic's different surface types exhibits various warming characteristics.          To further explore the impact of surface type on the seasonality and inter-model uncertainty of AA, a research team with Sun Yat-sen University and Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory used 17 CMIP6 models to divide the Arctic region into four surface types: ice-covered area, ice-retreat area, ice-free area, and land for analysis.The research team analyzed the difference between the abrupt-4 \u00d7 CO2 and pre-industrial experiments of 17 CMIP6 models. The results of the multimodal ensemble mean show that the seasonal pattern of Arctic warming\u2014with maximum warming in winter and weak warming in summer\u2014takes occurs in all regions except for ice-free regions.The ice-retreat region has the strongest warming and the largest seasonal contrast of AA. This result can be explained by the seasonal energy transfer mechanism, which refers to that during summer when sea ice melts, a large amount of heat is absorbed and stored by the open ocean, and released in winter.Their findings are published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences.Some studies have proposed that the changes in effective thermal inertia can lead to seasonal amplification in the Arctic. In summer, a larger ocean heat capacity will suppress warming, while in winter, a smaller heat capacity will accelerate warming, thereby amplifying the seasonal warming in the Arctic.Therefore, the research team also explored the impact of changes in the effective thermal inertia (ETI) of different surface types on AA. The research results indicate that there is a transition from sea ice to the ocean in the ice-retreat regions, resulting in the greatest thermal inertia change, which explains the most significant seasonal difference in the region. The weak thermal inertia changes in ice-free regions explain the uniform warming throughout the year.The research team concluded that the seasonal energy transfer mechanism and the changes in ETI work together to contribute to the seasonality of AA. As the model simulation is the main mean of predicting future Arctic climate, the team focused on the sources of inter-model uncertainty in AA.The team discussed the inter-model uncertainty of AA in different surface types and quantitatively analyzed the inter-model differences in various feedbacks. The results show that the ice-covered regions exhibit the maximum inter-model uncertainty in the January-February-March (JFM) months, which is mostly caused by the oceanic heat storage term.In addition, the ice-albedo feedback shows a large inter-model difference in ice-covered regions and ice-retreat regions, and the correlation between the ice-albedo feedback and Arctic warming is more than 0.66.\"Narrowing the differences in sea ice simulation is of great significance for better predicting Arctic climate in the future,\" said Dr. Xiaoming Hu, the corresponding author of the study.

  "question_squad": " What is one of the most important parameters for monitoring permafrost conditions?",
  "answer_squad": " Active layer thickness",
  "text": "Palsa mires found in the northernmost peatlands of Lapland are the main permafrost landforms in Fennoscandia. As the climate warms, palsa mires are expected to disappear and no new palsas have been observed to form. Active layer thickness is one of the most important parameters for monitoring permafrost conditions.          Underlain by permafrost, the active layer consists of soil or peat that thaws in the summer and freezes in the winter. As the active layer deepens, the previously frozen organic matter thaws, increasing carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions from the palsa mire. With the climate warming, this thawed layer above permafrost has become deeper in most areas where permafrost occurs.A long-term study conducted at the University of Eastern Finland shows a significant reduction in palsa area due to climate change. At the observation sites, palsa area had decreased by more than 75% from 1959 to 2021. However, climate had only a limited impact on the active layer of palsa mounds. Active layer thickness did not significantly increase during the monitoring period, although the lowering and collapse from the edges of palsas indicates that their permafrost core continues to thaw, year after year.\"In one of the observation sites, active layer thickness has in fact been significantly decreasing over the past eight years. This means that permafrost thawing doesn't necessarily lead to the deepening of the active layer,\" says first author, Doctoral Researcher Mariana Verdonen of the University of Eastern Finland who analyzed the data.Published in The Cryosphere, the study monitored the development of two palsa sites in the Kilpisj\u00e4rvi area in the north-western part of Finnish Lapland, since 2007. Data for the study were collected using high accuracy GNSS devices and active layer measurements as part of an annual field course organized by the University of Eastern Finland.\"It is very rewarding to see the 14 years of data we've collected with students now published in a high-ranking journal. This kind of a time series cannot be collected in short-term research projects that typically last for only three or four years,\" says Professor Timo Kumpula of the University of Eastern Finland, who initiated the study.The researchers also used old aerial photographs from 1959, 1985, 2000 and 2012, as well as annual unoccupied aerial system surveys conducted in 2016\u20132021. The study compared the active layer measurement time series and annual changes in palsa area with different climate parameters, such as air temperature, precipitation and snow cover.Later onset of snow cover has a surprising effect on active layer thicknessClimate change affects the timing, thickness and duration of snow cover. The warmer the autumn, the longer it takes for the ground to be covered by lasting snow. Later onset of lasting snow cover reduced active layer thickness in the palsa sites.\"This shows the multitude of effects climate change can have on permafrost. One could conclude that warmer autumns would be good for permafrost underneath palsas, but this is not the case because a thin active layer doesn't mean stable permafrost in palsa mires,\" Verdonen says.

  "question_squad": " What is the thick layer between the solid crust and molten core of the Earth?",
  "answer_squad": " the mantle",
  "text": "Most diamonds are formed deep inside Earth and brought close to the surface in small yet powerful volcanic eruptions of a kind of rock called \"kimberlite.\"          Our supercomputer modeling, published in Nature Geoscience, shows these eruptions are fueled by giant \"pillars of heat\" rooted 2,900 kilometers below ground, just above our planet's core.Understanding Earth's internal history can be used to target mineral reserves\u2014not only diamonds, but also crucial minerals such as nickel and rare earth elements.Kimberlite and hot blobsKimberlite eruptions leave behind a characteristic deep, carrot-shaped \"pipe\" of kimberlite rock, which often contains diamonds. Hundreds of these eruptions that occurred over the past 200 million years have been discovered around the world. Most of them were found in Canada (178 eruptions), South Africa (158), Angola (71) and Brazil (70).Between Earth's solid crust and molten core is the mantle, a thick layer of slightly goopy hot rock. For decades, geophysicists have used computers to study how the mantle slowly flows over long periods of time.In the 1980s, one study showed that kimberlite eruptions might be linked to small thermal plumes in the mantle\u2014feather-like upward jets of hot mantle rising due to their higher buoyancy\u2014beneath slowly moving continents.It had already been argued, in the 1970s, that these plumes might originate from the boundary between the mantle and the core, at a depth of 2,900km.Then, in 2010, geologists proposed that kimberlite eruptions could be explained by thermal plumes arising from the edges of two deep, hot blobs anchored under Africa and the Pacific Ocean.And last year, we reported that these anchored blobs are more mobile than we thought.However, we still didn't know exactly how activity deep in the mantle was driving kimberlite eruptions.      Pillars of heatGeologists assumed that mantle plumes could be responsible for igniting kimberlite eruptions. However, there was still a big question remaining: how was heat being transported from the deep Earth up to the kimberlites?                A snapshot of the global mantle convection model centred on subduction underneath the South American plate. Credit: \u00d6mer F. Bodur, Author provided             To address this question, we used supercomputers in Canberra, Australia to create three-dimensional geodynamic models of Earth's mantle. Our models account for the movement of continents on the surface and into the mantle over the past one billion years.We calculated the movements of heat upward from the core and discovered that broad mantle upwellings, or \"pillars of heat,\" connect the very deep Earth to the surface. Our modeling shows these pillars supply heat underneath kimberlites, and they explain most kimberlite eruptions over the past 200 million years.

Bodur, Author provided             The model successfully captured kimberlite eruptions in Africa, Brazil, Russia and partly in the United States and Canada. Our models also predict previously undiscovered kimberlite eruptions occurred in East Antarctica and the Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia.Earth\u2019s \u201cpillars of heat\u201d in a global mantle convection model can be used to predict kimberlite eruptions. Credit: \u00d6mer F. BodurTowards the center of the pillars, mantle plumes rise much faster and carry dense material across the mantle, which may explain chemical differences between kimberlites in different continents.Our models do not explain some of the kimberlites in Canada, which might be related to a different geological process called \"plate subduction.\" We have so far predicted kimberlites back to one billion years ago, which is the current limit of reconstructions of tectonic plate movements.

  "text": "Lakes provide critical resources for humankind. The interaction of optically active constituents in water with solar radiation makes the lakes on the Earth colorful.          Compared with a single water quality parameter, lake water color can reflect the comprehensive state change of lake environment. In general, lake color is related to productivity, water quality, and ecological state. Hence, the influences of climate and human activities on lake environments can be reflected in water color, to some extent.Researchers led by Dr. Cao Zhigang from Prof. Ma Ronghua's group at the Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, along with their collaborators, conducted a comprehensive examination of color in 2,550 Chinese lakes from 1984 to 2021. They revealed the spatial and temporal patterns of shifts in lake color as well as their relations to climate and human activities. Their findings were published in Geophysical Research Letters on April 25.\"In the past 40 years, the blue lakes in western China became bluer, and the green-yellow lakes in eastern China shifted to greener colors,\" said Dr. Cao.The researchers found that declines in visual wavelength were widespread whether in western China's blue lakes or in eastern China's non-blue (green and yellow) lakes. The decrease in visual wavelength of color was found in 1,723 lakes (68%) (mean changing rate: -8 nm/decade). Lakes in the Tibetan Plateau had larger declines in wavelength than lakes in other areas.\"Climate and human activities varied in different areas of China. Thus, controls from climate and humans on changing patterns of lake colors are heterogeneous across China,\" said Prof. Ma.Most lakes in western China (e.g., Tibetan Plateau) are blue. The bluer color is mainly related to the higher temperature and rainfall, which also resulted in lake expansion and elevated water clarity there.The lakes in eastern China (e.g., Yangtze River plain) are often \"green-yellow.\" With the decrease in wind speed over the past decades, the resuspension of sediments, which usually relates to lake turbidity, was weakened. Likewise, more forest and grassland around the lakes reduced substances flowing into them. These processes reduced sediments in surface water and made the lake color shift to a green direction. In Lake Taihu and Chaohu, where the cyanobacterial blooms frequently break out, the trends of \"greener\" colors are more significant.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the Spanish association of olive oil producers and exporters?",
  "answer_squad": " Asoliva",
  "text": "An ongoing drought and soaring temperatures have unleashed fears of an olive \"catastrophe\" in Spain, the world's largest producer of olive oil, which suffered a very difficult year in 2022.          \"It's barely rained since January. The ground is very dry,\" worries Cristobal Cano, secretary general of the small farmers' union (UPA) in the southern region of Andalusia, the heart of Spain's olive oil industry.Cano, who owns 10 hectares of olive trees in Alcala la Real near Granada, has never seen such a worrying situation in the 20 years he's been a farmer.\"If something doesn't change radically in the next few weeks, it's going to be a catastrophe,\" he warned.According to the AEMET weather agency, accumulated rainfall since October 1 has been 25 percent lower than normal across Spain and 50 percent lower in most of Andalusia, where reservoirs are at 25 percent capacity.And the situation worsened at the end of April, when an early heatwave brought exceptionally high temperatures that saw the mercury hit 38.8 degrees Celsius (101.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in southern Spain.\"This happened as the olive trees were in bloom,\" says Rafael Pico, director of Asoliva, the Spanish association of olive oil producers and exporters, who fears the blooms will dry up.\"If there are no flowers, there's no fruit. And if there's no fruit, there's no oil.\"                Conditions deteriorated in April with a heatwave just as the olive trees were in bloom.             'On the brink of collapse'For Spain\u2014which normally supplies 50 percent of the world's olive oil and exports close to 3.0 billion euros ($3.3 billion) worth every year\u2014the situation is even more worrying given the sector's disastrous output in 2021-2022.During that season too, a lack of rain and extreme temperatures saw olive oil production plummeting 55 percent to 660,000 tonnes, compared to 1.48 million tonnes in 2021-2022, agriculture ministry figures show.The scene is set to play out again this year.\"Looking at the forecasts, it's almost a given\u2014it's going to be another grim year,\" says Rafael Sanchez de Puerta, head of Dcoop, Spain's leading olive cooperative.If the predictions prove true, it could spell the end for many olive farms.\"We can cope with one difficult year. It's a natural part of the growing cycle. But two years in a row will be a disaster. Many are on the brink of collapse,\" he says.With the cost of machinery, paying salaries and repaying loans, \"farmers need liquidity\" to remain afloat, says Asoliva's Pico, recalling that many in Spain live from olive oil production.                Andalusia is central to the industry in Spain, the world's top olive oil producer.             Runaway pricesFor consumers, the outlook is also bleak.\"The global price of olive oil depends largely on Spain,\" says Pico.In recent months, the price of oil has jumped.\"In mid-April, olive oil was selling at 5,800 euros ($6,400) per tonne, up from 5,300 euros in January,\" says Fanny de Gasquet of Baillon Intercor, a brokerage firm specialising in oils and fats.In January 2022, it was selling at 3,500 euros.And the upward trend looks set to continue.In Andalusia, young olive trees \"don't have sufficiently developed roots to be able to extract water\" from deep underground, meaning \"there will be losses\" that will have an impact on production over the next two or three years, she warns.At the end of 2022, the Spanish government moved to lower VAT on olive oil from 10 percent to five percent as part of a package of measures to help consumers in the face of soaring inflation.                Olive farmer Cristobal Cano has never seen such a worrying situation.             And to help farmers cope with the drought, the government has reduced the sector's income tax by 25 percent.But for many, it's too little in the face of the looming crisis.\"Lowering taxes for people who will have almost no income is of little use to them,\" says Dcoop's Sanchez de Puerta, calling for more ambitious moves to combat \"a drought that is lasting longer than it should\".    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Drought spells 'catastrophe' for Spain's olive harvest (2023, May 9)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-drought-catastrophe-spain-olive-harvest.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Working under an improvised shed hidden in the rainforest, Webson Nunes hears a shout and flips on his winch, hauling a colleague up from deep inside a giant hole with a bucket full of riches.          Nunes, 28, and his four colleagues are \"garimpeiros,\" illegal miners who dig for precious minerals\u2014in their case, at a wildcat copper mine outside Canaa dos Carajas, a small city at the edge of the Brazilian Amazon that has become a boom town in recent years thanks to mining.Canaa\u2014Portuguese for Canaan, the Biblical \"Promised Land\"\u2014is a place of extremes: At one end of the spectrum sits mining giant Vale, which runs one of the world's biggest open-air mines here.Known as S11D, the iron-ore mine made the city the richest in Brazil in 2020 in GDP per capita.At the other end are an estimated 100 illegal mines like the one where Nunes is employed, bootstrap operations where \"garimpeiros\"\u2014Portuguese for \"prospectors\"\u2014make a living digging holes in the earth, living on constant alert in case of a raid.\"I work with one eye here (on the mine), and the other outside. The police could arrive at any moment,\" says Nunes, inside the tarp-covered shack above the narrow, wet, 20-meter (22-yard)-deep hole into which he lowers his colleagues with a harness and steel cable to haul up big blue buckets of shiny, mineral-rich rocks.But Nunes, who has been doing this for seven years, says he sees it as just another job\u2014albeit a lucrative one. The mine owner pays him 150 reais ($30) a day, a nice salary in these parts.                Copper miner Valmir Souza Silva shows off a recent find from one of the 100 or so illegal mines, in Canaa dos Carajas, Para State, Brazil.             'Severe environmental damage'Illegal mines make around $800 per metric ton of copper they sell on the black market.This one typically produces more than that in a day, the miners told AFP.Authorities say the copper mined illegally in Canaa mainly gets exported to China.Police say they have also detected illegal gold mines in the area, which cause greater environmental damage because of the mercury used to separate gold from soil.Canaa's population has boomed along with its economy.Since 2016, when Vale launched S11D, employing 9,000 people, the town has nearly tripled in size, from 26,000 inhabitants to 75,000.The town, located in the northern state of Para, voted heavily in Brazil's presidential elections last year for far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, who narrowly lost to veteran leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.                'Garimpeiros,' as illegal miners are known in Brazil, live and work on constant alert in case of a police raid.             Bolsonaro, whose father was a garimpeiro, defended wildcat miners as president, pushing to allow mining on protected lands in the Amazon and drawing condemnation from environmentalists.Since taking office in January, Lula has cracked down on illegal mining in the world's biggest rainforest.Police have staged six raids in the Canaa region since August 2022, unearthing what they called \"severe environmental damage\" in the form of \"severely\" discolored rivers and forestland turned into giant pools of toxic mud.Officers typically destroy miners' operations, flooding their mine shafts and seizing or burning their equipment.But it does little to stop them: The same miners can sometimes be seen back at work the next day, says Genivaldo Casadei, a garimpeiro leader.Casadei, 51, is treasurer of a local small-scale miners' cooperative trying to win legal status for their work.Under Bolsonaro, miners were in advanced talks with the federal mining agency to do just that, he says.                Former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro talked of legalizing wildcat mines, a move opposed by environmentalists and his successor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.             Lula's victory put an end to that.\"In the cities, people see garimpeiros as criminals. But we're just workers trying to feed our families,\" says Casadei.\"If (wildcat mining) were regulated, it would create jobs and tax revenue. Canaa could be the richest city in the world.\"      'Dangerous job'Garimpeiros say it is unjust that Vale, the world's biggest iron ore producer, has a monopoly on mining rights on local land, but uses just 13 percent of it.Getting authorization for small-scale mines is nearly impossible, they say.Crouching over a pile of shiny rocks from a mining pit, Valmir Souza bangs at them with a hammer, separating the copper from the rest.\"It's a hard, dangerous job,\" says Souza, 33, who works in gloves, rubber boots and a white helmet.He arrived here seven months ago from his northeastern home state, Maranhao, the poorest in Brazil, where he worked teaching capoeira, a Brazilian dance form and martial art.                'Garimpeiros' complain that Brazilian mining giant Vale, whose Sossego copper mine is seen from above on April 19, 2023, has a monopoly on mining rights on local land.             There is more opportunity in Canaa, he says.But \"we have to work in secret,\" he adds. \"What else can we do?\"    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Illegal mining booms in Brazilian Amazon 'promised land' (2023, May 9)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-illegal-booms-brazilian-amazon.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has boosted the unnecessary use of antimicrobial chemicals linked to health problems, antimicrobial resistance, and environmental harm, warn more than two dozen scientists in Environmental Science & Technology.          Their critical review details how quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are increasingly marketed and used in home, health care, education, and workplace settings despite the availability of safer alternatives and in some cases limited evidence of reduced disease transmission.\"Disinfectant wipes containing QACs are often used on children's school desks, hospital exam tables, and in homes where they remain on these surfaces and in the air,\" said Courtney Carignan, a co-author and assistant professor at Michigan State University. \"Our review of the science suggests disinfecting with these chemicals in many cases is unhelpful or even harmful. We recommend regular cleaning with soap and water and disinfecting only as needed with safer products.\"Human studies have found associations between QACs and asthma, dermatitis, and inflammation. Laboratory animal studies also raise concerns about potential links to infertility, birth defects, and more. Further, there has been evidence dating back to the 1950s that QACs contribute to antimicrobial resistance, making certain bacteria species resistant both to QACs themselves and to critical antibiotics.\"It's ironic that the chemicals we're deploying in vain for one health crisis are actually fueling another,\" said Erica Hartmann, a co-author and professor at Northwestern University. \"Antimicrobial resistance was already contributing to millions of deaths per year before the pandemic. Overzealous disinfection, especially with products containing QACs, threaten to make it worse.\"QACs are increasingly used in disinfectant solutions, wipes, hand sanitizers, sprays, and foggers, and are also being incorporated into personal care products, textiles, paints, medical instruments, and more. Since the pandemic, levels of these chemicals in the environment and our bodies have increased in parallel.One of the most common QACs is benzalkonium chloride, but others can be identified on ingredient labels with names that end in \"ammonium chloride\" or similar. However, disclosure and regulation of QACs varies widely. For example pesticide labels are required to list QACs but paint labels are not. Most QACs are not regulated at all, nor are they comprehensively screened for health hazards.The scientists recommend eliminating uses of QACs that are either unnecessary or where their effectiveness has not been demonstrated. For example, disinfection with QACs often has no benefit over cleaning with plain soap and water. Other recommendations include requiring full disclosure of QACs in all products and closely monitoring their levels in people and the environment.\"Drastically reducing many uses of QACs won't spread COVID-19,\" said Carol Kwiatkowski, a co-author and scientist at the Green Science Policy Institute. \"In fact, it will make our homes, classrooms, offices, and other shared spaces healthier.\" More information:Erica Hartmann et al, Quaternary Ammonium Compounds: A Chemical Class of Emerging Concern, Environmental Science & Technology (2023).

  "text": "While conducting a study of Petermann Glacier in northwest Greenland, researchers at the University of California, Irvine and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory uncovered a previously unseen way in which the ice and ocean interact. The glaciologists said their findings could mean that the climate community has been vastly underestimating the magnitude of future sea level rise caused by polar ice deterioration.          Using satellite radar data from three European missions, the UCI/NASA team learned that Petermann Glacier's grounding line\u2014where ice detaches from the land bed and begins floating in the ocean\u2014shifts substantially during tidal cycles, allowing warm seawater to intrude and melt ice at an accelerated rate. The group's results are the subject of a paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\"Petermann's grounding line could be more accurately described as a grounding zone, because it migrates between 2 and 6 kilometers as tides come in and out,\" said lead author Enrico Ciraci, UCI assistant specialist in Earth system science and NASA postdoctoral fellow. \"This is an order of magnitude larger than expected for grounding lines on a rigid bed.\"He said the traditional view of grounding lines beneath ocean-reaching glaciers was that they did not migrate during tidal cycles, nor did they experience ice melt. But the new study replaces that thinking with knowledge that warm ocean water intrudes beneath the ice through preexisting subglacial channels, with the highest melt rates occurring at the grounding zone.The researchers found that as Petermann Glacier's grounding line retreated nearly 4 kilometers\u20142\u00bd miles\u2014between 2016 and 2022, warm water carved a 670-foot-tall cavity in the underside of the glacier, and that abscess remained there for all of 2022.\"These ice-ocean interactions make the glaciers more sensitive to ocean warming,\" said senior co-author Eric Rignot, UCI professor of Earth system science and NASA JPL research scientist. \"These dynamics are not included in models, and if we were to include them, it would increase projections of sea level rise by up to 200 percent\u2014not just for Petermann but for all glaciers ending in the ocean, which is most of northern Greenland and all of Antarctica.\"The Greenland ice sheet has lost billions of tons of ice to the ocean in the past few decades, the PNAS paper stresses, with most of the loss caused by warming of subsurface ocean waters, a product of Earth's changing climate. Exposure to ocean water melts the ice vigorously at the glacier front and erodes resistance to the movement of glaciers over the ground, causing the ice to slide more quickly to the sea, according to Rignot.

  "text": "New research provides clear evidence of a human \"fingerprint\" on climate change and shows that specific signals from human activities have altered the temperature structure of Earth's atmosphere.          Differences between tropospheric and lower stratospheric temperature trends have long been recognized as a fingerprint of human effects on climate. This fingerprint, however, neglected information from the mid to upper stratosphere, 25 to 50 kilometers above the Earth's surface.\"Including this information improves the detectability of a human fingerprint by a factor of five. Enhanced detectability occurs because the mid to upper stratosphere has a large cooling signal from human-caused CO2 increases, small noise levels of natural internal variability, and differing signal and noise patterns,\" according to the journal article, \"Exceptional stratospheric contribution to human fingerprints on atmospheric temperature,\" published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).Noise in the troposphere can include day-to-day weather, interannual variability arising from El Ni\u00f1os and La Ni\u00f1as, and longer-term natural fluctuations in climate. In the upper stratosphere, the noise of variability is smaller, and the human-caused climate change signal is larger, so the signal can be much more easily distinguished.\"Extending fingerprinting to the upper stratosphere with long temperature records and improved climate models means that it is now virtually impossible for natural causes to explain satellite-measured trends in the thermal structure of the Earth's atmosphere,\" the paper states.\"This is the clearest evidence there is of a human-caused climate change signal associated with CO2 increases,\" according to lead author Benjamin Santer, an adjunct scientist in the Physical Oceanography Department at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) in Massachusetts.\"This research undercuts and rebuts claims that recent atmospheric and surface temperature changes are natural, whether due to the Sun or due to internal cycles in the climate system. A natural explanation is virtually impossible in terms of what we are looking at here: changes in the temperature structure of the atmosphere,\" added Santer, who has worked on climate fingerprinting for more than 30 years. \"This research puts to rest incorrect claims that we don't need to treat climate change seriously because it is all natural.\"      The research was motivated by earlier work by Suki Manabe and Richard Wetherald, who in 1967 used a simple climate model to study how CO2 from fossil fuel burning might change atmospheric temperature.Their modeling found a very distinctive feature: an increase in CO2 levels led to more trapping of heat in the troposphere (the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere) and less heat escaping higher up into the stratosphere (the layer above the troposphere), thus warming the troposphere and cooling the stratosphere. This prediction of tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling in response to increasing CO2 has been confirmed many times by more complex models and verified by comparing model results with global-mean atmospheric temperature observations from weather balloons and satellites.Although these earlier studies considered global-mean temperature changes in the middle and upper stratosphere, roughly 25 to 50 kilometers above Earth's surface, they did not look at detailed patterns of climate change in this layer. This region can be better studied now because of improved simulations and satellite data. The new research is the first to search for human-caused climate change patterns\u2014also called \"fingerprints\"\u2014in the middle and upper stratosphere.\"The human fingerprints in temperature changes in the mid to upper stratosphere due to CO2 increases are truly exceptional because they are so large and so different from temperature changes there due to internal variability and natural external forcing. These unique fingerprints make it possible to detect the human impact on climate change due to CO2 in a short period of time (~10\u201415 years) with high confidence,\" stated co-author Qiang Fu, a professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington.\"The world has been reeling under climate change, so being as confident as possible of the role of carbon dioxide is critical,\" said co-author Susan Solomon, Martin Professor of Environmental Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"The fact that observations show not only a warming troposphere but also a strongly cooling upper stratosphere is unique tell-tale evidence that nails the dominant role of carbon dioxide in climate change and greatly increases confidence.\"Santer said that although it is intellectually gratifying to be able to extend fingerprinting higher up into the atmosphere to test the prediction by Manabe and Wetherald, it is also deeply concerning.\"As someone who tries to understand the kind of world that future generations are going to inhabit, these results make me very worried. We are fundamentally changing the thermal structure of Earth's atmosphere, and there is no joy in recognizing that,\" Santer said.\"This study shows that the real world has changed in a way that simply cannot be explained by natural causes,\" Santer added. \"We now face important decisions, in the United States and globally, on what to do about climate change. I hope those decisions are based on our best scientific understanding of the reality and seriousness of human effects on climate.\" More information:Benjamin D.

  "text": "Canada struggled on Monday to control wildfires that have forced thousands to flee, halted oil production and razed towns, with the western province of Alberta calling for federal help.          Some 30,000 people were ordered to leave their homes over the past three days, as nearly 100 fires flared across the province\u2014including 27 out of control.Federal disaster officials and the military were on standby, after Alberta leader Danielle Smith spoke with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to formally ask for assistance.\"Canadians stand with the people of Alberta as they deal with these terrible, terrible wildfires,\" Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa.\"We were watching images from the communities affected by these wildfires and I assured Danielle that we will be there to help,\" he said.Details of what supports would be made available were not immediately released.In Alberta, firefighters prioritized dousing flames threatening homes and businesses. Many roads near the provincial capital Edmonton were blocked off as temporary shelters welcomed evacuees.Officials said 390,000 hectares had burned, patients and long-term care residents had to be relocated and many schools were closed.Oil firms\u2014including Vermilion Energy and Crescent Point Energy\u2014announced temporary shutdowns of operations, slashing production by more than 125,000 barrels of oil per day.Many residents and oil workers rode to safety in motorhomes or with campers in tow, and set up in empty parking lots.                A helicopter carrying a \"Bambi Bucket\" flies toward a forest fire near the town of Drayton Valley in Canada's Alberta province.             Others are staying with friends or family, like Jerry Greiner, a resident from Dayton Valley, west of Edmonton, the capital of Alberta.\"We could see the smoke on Friday and there was a pretty strong wind,\" the 55-year-old told AFP, his eyes tearing up as he recounted receiving the order to evacuate that night.\"We quickly grabbed our bags (and went) to our friends' house. About 12 people stayed there,\" he said. This was the first time Greiner has ever had to flee wildfires.Dayton Valley, a small town of 7,000, was completely abandoned. Trees and grass fields all around were blackened by the fires, and smoke billowed from a few charred buildings, but most of the homes appeared intact, observed an AFP reporter.Black smokey skiesIt was not clear when residents would be permitted to return.Resident Randy Braun, 57, said the fire chief told locals it would be \"at least a week minimum.\"      Smith said the fires \"may continue on for several months,\" but added that evacuation orders had been lifted in the morning for three communities.Kathy Bereuwski, 61, escaped with her family and dogs. \"The sky,\" she told AFP, \"was pitch black\" with smoke and falling ash.In the northern community of Fox Lake, a fire destroyed 20 homes, a store and a police station. Residents had to be evacuated by boat and helicopter.                It was not clear when residents would be permitted to return.             The Alberta premier declared a state of emergency on Saturday, calling the wildfire situation \"unprecedented.\"The province\u2014one of the world's largest oil-producing regions\u2014\"has been experiencing a hot, dry spring and with so much kindling, all it takes is a few sparks to ignite some truly frightening wildfires,\" she said.Almost all of Alberta as well as much of neighboring Saskatchewan province, parts of British Columbia and a large swath of the Northwest Territories face extreme fire risks.Two out-of-control wildfires in westernmost British Columbia have also forced residents to evacuate, and authorities have warned they expect strong winds to swell those blazes.In recent years, western Canada has been hit repeatedly by extreme weather, the intensity and frequency of which have increased due to global warming.Forest fires in Canada's oil sands region in 2016 disrupted production and forced out 100,000 residents from Fort McMurray, pummelling the nation's economy.More recently in 2021, British Columbia suffered record-high temperatures over the summer that killed more than 500 people, as well as wildfires that destroyed an entire town.That was followed by devastating floods and mudslides.Christie Tucker, a spokesperson with Alberta's wildfire agency, said Monday brought \"a continuation of yesterday's break in the hot weather across most of the province, with light scattered showers.\"\"It's a much needed chance to make progress on some of these powerful, challenging wildfires,\" she said. \"But we're not out of the woods yet.\"    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Western Canada seeks urgent help to fight wildfires (2023, May 8)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-western-canada-urgent-wildfires.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_squad": " 175 miles",
  "text": "Discarded or drifting in the ocean, plastic debris can accumulate on the water's surface, forming floating islands of garbage. Although it's harder to spot, researchers suspect a significant amount also sinks. In a new study in Environmental Science & Technology, one team used computer modeling to study how far bits of lightweight plastic travel when falling into the Mediterranean Sea. Their results suggest these particles can drift farther underwater than previously thought.          From old shopping bags to water bottles, plastic pollution is besieging the oceans. Not only is this debris unsightly, animals can become trapped in it or mistakenly eat it. And if it remains in the water, plastic waste can release organic pollutants.The problem is most visible on the surface, where currents can aggregate this debris into massive, so-called garbage patches. However, plastic waste also collects much deeper. Even material that weighs less than water can sink as algae and other organisms glom onto it, and through other processes.Bits of this light plastic, which typically measure 5 millimeters or less, have turned up at least half a mile below the surface. Researchers don't know much about what happens when plastic sinks, but they generally assume it falls straight down from the surface. However, Alberto Baudena and his colleagues suspected this light plastic might not follow such a direct route.To test this assumption, they used an advanced computer model developed to track plastic at sea and incorporated extensive data already collected on floating plastic pollution in the Mediterranean Sea. They then simulated nearly 7.7 million bits of plastic distributed across the sea and tracked their virtual paths to depths as great as about half a mile.Their results suggested that the slower the pieces sank, the farther currents carried them from their points of origin, with slowest traveling an average of roughly 175 miles laterally. While observations of the distribution of plastic underwater are limited, the team found their simulations agree with those available in the Mediterranean.Their simulations also suggested that currents may push plastic toward coastal areas and that only about 20% of pollution near coasts originates from the nearest country. These particles' long journeys mean this plastic has greater potential to interact with, and harm, marine life, according to the researchers.

  "text": "In a first-of-its-kind analysis, Cornell researchers and partners at the Clinton Health Access Initiative found that pharmaceutical producers could reduce their environmental impact by roughly half by optimizing manufacturing processes and supply chain networks and by switching to renewable energy sources.          The findings were published on the cover of the May 1 issue of ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering. First author of the paper, \"Environmental Sustainability of the Globalized Pharmaceutical Supply Chains: The Case of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate,\" is Yanqiu Tao, M.S. '21, a doctoral student in the lab of Fengqi You, the Roxanne E. and Michael J. Zak Professor in Energy Systems Engineering and a senior faculty fellow with the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability.Pharmaceutical manufacturing is a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, similar in magnitude to the automotive industry, though it has not received anywhere near the level of academic or regulatory scrutiny, You said.\"Much of the focus of decarbonization centers on products like solar panels and electric cars, which are very important, but pharmaceuticals are also a tremendous and growing contributor,\" he said. \"We hope our study will become a motivating example for other academic collaborations and policy agenda studies around decarbonizing the pharmaceutical industry.\"Most previous studies investigating the environmental impact of pharmaceuticals have focused on the manufacturing or formulation stage, while this study explored the full life-cycle carbon impact of the HIV antiretroviral drug Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF), Tao said.\"We included extraction, procurement and production of raw materials, to manufacturing and formulation, to packaging, transportation and distribution, and to waste treatment post-consumption by the patient,\" Tao said. \"We are the first, very comprehensive and systematic assessment of the pharmaceutical life cycle of any drug.\"By far the biggest contributor to carbon impact is the energy source used in manufacturing, the researchers found. Many generic drugs, including TDF, are produced in India, which primarily relies on coal for its energy. Drug producers should be encouraged to power their operations with renewables instead, the authors said. Large transportation distances between raw material sources, production facilities and patients also contribute to carbon impact; carefully optimizing supply chain networks could alone reduce life cycle carbon footprint by up to 9.3%, the study found. Changes in the way TDF is manufactured, such as improving recycling of used solvent chemicals, and minimizing packaging, could also reduce environmental impact.The thorough analysis\u2014which concluded that TDF producers could realistically reduce their carbon footprint by up to 45%\u2014was possible only because of the close collaboration between faculty and students at Cornell and the nonprofit Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), You said. Because of CHAI's long-standing work to support equitable access to HIV treatment in low-income countries, the organization had access to unique information about supply chains and manufacturing processes, said Neel Lakhani, MBA '07, M.I.L.R. '08, senior director of strategy and innovation for CHAI and a co-author of the new study.\"This paper as a standalone was incredibly well done, shining a light on an understudied and complex area,\" Lakhani said. \"I believe this paper can also serve as a model for not just how this drug can be produced in a more environmentally conscious manner, but how many other drug molecules can be produced more sustainably.\"In addition to Tao, You and Lakhani, study co-authors are Shoudong Zhu, a master's student in You's lab, and Janet Smith, M.S.

  "text": "Scientific evidence shows that the tropical belt around the middle of the globe is expanding. For years scientists have proposed different mechanisms that might explain this expansion. A team of researchers has now determined that the poleward advancing mid-latitude meridional temperature gradient plays a leading role in the tropical expansion.          Their work is published in the journal Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Research.In 2006, scientists discovered that the Hadley Circulation, which determines the tropical belts, is expanding towards higher latitudes under changing climate. This expansion reshapes the patterns of precipitation, winds, clouds, and storms, and may potentially contribute to the migration of global populations.\"Despite the importance of this phenomenon, the underlying mechanisms driving tropical expansion have been debated for more than 17 years without reaching a consensus,\" said Hu Yang, now a principal investigator at the Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai), China. \"Many scientists believe that the mechanism is very complex.\"However, Yang and his colleagues think it can be very simple. In 2020, they published a paper, suggesting that tropical expansion is driven by poleward advancing of the meridional temperature gradient, which arises from the spatially non-uniform ocean warming pattern.However, this idea was questioned by several existing studies based on idealized experiments. For example, an earlier study found that in the abrupt 4xCO2 experiment, when the atmospheric CO2 content is instantaneously quadrupled on the coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere models, it results in an abrupt expansion of the tropics. Other scientists with differing views do not believe that the ocean can introduce a rapid migrations of temperature gradients because of the thermostat of the ocean.Furthermore, without involving any sea surface temperature warming pattern, the amip4K experiment, which introduce uniform 4 K ocean temperature anomaly into the atmospheric model, also reproduce tropical expansion, seeming contradict Yang's hypothesis.In 2023, the research team revisited these experiments, and found that they in fact all support the idea that the shift of meridional temperature gradients drives tropical expansion.The abrupt 4xCO2 experiment they revisited demonstrated a rapid subtropical ocean warming, which promotes abrupt migration of the mid-latitude meridional temperature gradient and tropical expansion. The amip4K experiment they revisited showed a consistent poleward shift of the mid-latitude meridional temperature gradient and jet streams in the troposphere, despite uniform surface warming. These are all in line with the meridional temperature gradient mechanism.The team also used an idealized global cooling experiment, to further simulate tropical expansion under conditions of reducing static stability and poleward shifting of the meridional temperature gradient. All of their results supported their hypothesis that meridional temperature gradient migration is the key driver of tropical expansion.\"The shift of the meridional temperature gradient can simply and consistently explain almost all the features of tropical expansion,\" said Hu Yang. Looking ahead, the team hopes their study of tropical expansion is helpful for future research. \"We hope this study can end the long debate of mechanism of tropical expansion, and scientists can use this mechanism to better understand and predict the tropical expansion in a changing climate.\" More information:Hu Yang et al, Evaluating the Mechanism of Tropical Expansion Using Idealized Numerical Experiments, Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Research (2023).

  "text": "For the climate, it is a shocking number: By the middle of last year, the capacity of new coal-fired power plants under construction or planned totaled 476 gigawatts worldwide. If all were built and ran until the end of their economic lifetime, this would make the international goal of limiting global heating to below 2 and preferably 1.5 degrees unattainable. However, a study now examines the official announcements, which are compiled by the U.S. information service Global Energy Monitor, in terms of their implementation\u2014and indicates that about 50% will be canceled.          The study was led by the Berlin-based climate research institute MCC (Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change), and published in the journal Environmental Research Letters. \"For the negotiations on the global coal phase-out, it is important to have a realistic appreciation of the increase in power plants that still lies ahead,\" explains Jan Steckel, head of the MCC working group Climate and Development and co-author of the study.\"Planning, and even construction of new plants may be put on hold if, for example, changes occur in finance, national energy strategies, or costs of renewable energies. We shed light on the baseline and thus the level of ambition of past and future coal agreements, the so-called JETPs.\"Since 2021, Just Energy Transition Partnerships, representing countries in the Global South and wealthy industrialized countries, have been negotiating on aid programs for phasing out this particularly climate-damaging form of power generation. For South Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam, initial deals worth billions have already been struck.The analysis now presented draws on a scientific survey of international experts. This is an established research method that is frequently used, especially in the energy sector, for topics where hard statistics are not yet available. In a systematic search process, the research team identified 29 particularly knowledgeable experts from 10 countries that account for 90% of the new coal-fired power plants under construction or officially planned: Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Mongolia, Pakistan, Turkey, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe. The experts were contacted in autumn 2021, that is, before the conclusion of the first JETP agreements, to provide expertise for their own country and, to an extent, for other countries.The responses show that the reduction in future coal investments negotiated with Vietnam and Indonesia corresponds more or less to what had been expected among experts anyway. The likely implementation of the announced coal-fired power plants varies greatly across countries: according to the forecast, the most cancelations are in Bangladesh and Mongolia, and the least in China.The research team also asked about the reasons for plan changes: in addition to technical and commercial aspects, the political economy of coal, i.e., consideration of regional jobs, tax payments or influence of the coal industry, also play an important role (MCC presented an extensive research work on this last year).Overall, the experts assume that in the coming years and decades, around 215 gigawatts of new coal-fired power plant capacity will be installed in the 10 countries examined. The study also looks at what this would mean for the climate.\"In three quarters of the scientific climate policy scenarios with only 1.5 degrees of global heating, coal use worldwide is down to zero by 2050,\" says Lorenzo Montrone, lead author of the study and until recently a Ph.D. student at MCC. \"Our study shows how important it is to have international support to phase out coal and develop alternatives. One way to deal with the newly built plants would be to limit their lifetime to 15 years. If that succeeded, the 1.5-degree limit would still be well within reach.\" More information:Lorenzo Montrone et al, Investment in new coal-fired power plants after the COVID-19 pandemic: experts expect 170\u2013270 GW of new coal, Environmental Research Letters (2023).

Seasonal temperature difference, also referred to as temperature annual cycle, is a dominant feature of climate systems outside the tropics and has important impacts on social and biological systems. Our understanding of seasonal temperature difference, however, is largely hampered by short observational records.In this study, the researchers analyzed tree ring records across East Asia and identified those that were separately sensitive to winter or summer temperature changes, but not to both. Using the selected seasonal temperature sensitive tree ring records, they reconstructed the difference of summer and winter temperatures over the past six centuries.They found that the reconstructed seasonal temperature difference of East Asia showed a sustained weakening trend as early as the 1870s, which is largely caused by anthropogenic forcing.The emergence time of the climate signal in the reconstructed seasonal temperature difference was assessed. \"The anthropogenic forcing has already driven the current state of seasonal temperature difference beyond the range of the natural variability since the 1370s,\" said Prof. Wang Jianglin from NIEER.\"Our study implies a further weakening of seasonal temperature difference in the future as a result of ongoing anthropogenic warming,\" said Prof. Wang. \"This may have important social and ecological implications, e.g., plant phenology and the transmission of seasonal diseases.\" More information:Jianglin Wang et al, Recent weakening of seasonal temperature difference in East Asia beyond the historical range of variability since the 14th century, Science China Earth Sciences (2023).

  "text": "Tens of thousands of people living in and around the Martinez Refinery Co. in Martinez, California, still don't know for certain if\u2014or to what extent\u2014they were poisoned last November.          But five months after 24 tons of toxic, dusty residue from gasoline, diesel and jet fuel flowing through the refinery first showered down on its next-door neighbors, new soil samples collected this week may finally confirm what dangers still linger there by late May or early June, county health officials announced Thursday.Last Thanksgiving, the company posted on Facebook that the fine white substance that blanketed cars, porches and plants over the holiday was from a \"non-toxic\", \"non-hazardous\" and \"naturally occurring\" catalyst dust expelled from its facility on the edge of town.But within a few days, the Contra Costa County Health Department alerted residents that the ashy grit actually contained aluminum, barium, chromium and other hazardous metals\u2014chemicals that are linked to nausea, vomiting, respiratory issues, immune system dysfunction, cancer and even death.People living nearby were told in March to discard any food grown in gardens and fruit trees, just to be safe.On Thursday, TRC, a Concord-based environmental consulting firm, started collecting soil samples from 14 different sites neighboring the refinery, which is located at 3485 Pacheco Blvd. Toxicologists will now evaluate the extent of contamination that residents were exposed to through skin contact, inhalation or consumption of food grown in the ground, according to Laura Trozzolo, a senior human health risk assessor with TRC.She said the soil sample locations were chosen based on a map of where the plume of particles likely landed, using models from the Bay Area Air Quality Management District created using residents' observations and wind simulations.Trozzolo said that neither the five-month delay in data collection\u2014due to the county's lengthy contracting procedures\u2014nor the recent historic storms that drenched the area should negatively impact lab findings.\"If we've had any deposition that might have landed on the surface over time, we're still going to be capturing that within that top six-inch soil layer,\" Trozzolo said during a press conference Thursday afternoon. \"We do believe that we're still characterizing and capturing conditions that occurred during that November event.\"      Nicole Heath, director of the county's hazardous materials program, said a 1990s-era industrial safety ordinance allows them to initiate an independent investigation and community risk assessment any time there's a \"major chemical accident or release,\" such as the Martinez Refinery Co. event.She said that ordinance allows the county to form an oversight committee, which brings together elected officials, county staff and community members with representatives from the refinery and its labor force.\"An independent incident investigation will look at root cause analyses, which would then determine exactly what happened, why it happened and what can we do to prevent things like this from happening again,\" Heath said, later adding that similar chemical releases happened twice before at the refinery in the early 2000s, which was owned by Shell at the time. \"We're responsible, as the oversight committee, for holding the facility accountable.\"Meanwhile, the Contra Costa District Attorney's office opened up a case in January on the refinery's failure to notify hazmat officials about the hazardous release, according to Matthew Kaufmann, the county's deputy health director.Kaufmann said that while the health department can invoice the refinery to reimburse expenses during their investigation, the DA will be in charge of deciding whether or not the Martinez Refining Company should be responsible for financially compensating residents who lost food and soil.Physical remediation efforts are also stalled until the upcoming lab results are complete, Heath said.In the meantime, the county is still recommending that residents impacted by the toxic dust avoid eating any produce planted in the soil. However, gardeners are also encouraged to plant new seeds, in the event that soil samples don't uncover any hazards.\"We are waiting to have the information from the soil sampling and risk assessment from TRC so that we can provide the answers that we know the community is so desperately, desperately seeking,\" Heath said. \"These corrective actions are in such a nature that they are intended to prevent something similar from happening again.\"    2023 MediaNews Group, Inc.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "text": "A team of researchers began their journey around frigid Patagonia, moving through water channels to reach the fjords, surrounded by ice and snow. They withstood freezing temperatures throughout their journey, all in the hope of extracting the perfect sediment core: the key to glacial history in the Southern Patagonian Ice Field.          Over the course of their research, which led to a study recently published in Quaternary Science Reviews, lead author Matthias Troch of Ghent University and his colleagues geochemically analyzed a 12.2 meter-long sediment core from an area in Patagonia called the Wide Channel to determine when glaciers retreated and stabilized in the geological past. Their findings on glacial waxing and waning patterns may offer insights as to how the area's glaciers may respond in the future as global temperatures increase.Located in the southernmost part of South America, the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, where the team did its research, is one of two major ice fields in the Patagonian Andes. Ice fields are a series of interconnected ice caps and glaciers. Patagonia's Northern and Southern Ice Fields are the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, apart from those in Antarctica. They are home to some of the world's fastest-flowing glaciers, and ice flow speeds vary between glaciers across the ice fields.The Southern Patagonia Ice Field stretches north to south for 220 miles, and it's drained by 53 main outlet glaciers. The remote landscape is characterized by a chilly, snowy climate with high mountain peaks and clouds that block most incoming sunlight. Westerly winds take up large amounts of moisture as they cross the Pacific, releasing up to 160 inches of precipitation onto the peaks each year. The elements pose many challenges for researchers seeking to understand the shrinking glaciers in the area; many are forced to spend weeks waiting for weather conducive to traveling, and researchers are often stuck in tents for long periods while waiting for unfavorable weather to clear.As ice flows through glaciers, it grinds up rock into fine particles as it passes over the bedrock. These fine particles are carried by streams that flow out of the glaciers, and the sediments are eventually deposited in oceans and glacier-fed lakes. As these sediments are deposited, they create distinct layers, each from a different period of time. Researchers then approach these sites with cylindrical tools, extracting long, cylindrical samples of sediment: these samples are sediment cores. Sediment cores, though fascinating in and of themselves, contain a record of past glacial activity.      The research team traveled through the Wide Channel alongside the ice fields, collecting samples from the fjord by boat. Sediment cores are composed of two main sections: gray clay on the bottom and alternating dark gray, light gray, and brown mud and clay layers on top. Since each layer of sediment represents a different period of time and draws on different portions of the underlying bedrock, the magnetic properties and grain sizes of the sediment particles vary. The study authors analyzed numerous sediment core properties to determine what grain sizes, rock characteristics, chronology, and sediment composition reveal about glacial patterns over the past 10,000\u201315,000 years.                Credit: Hannes Grobe/Wikimedia, Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license             The researchers analyzed numerous properties, allowing them to determine exact periods of glacial stability and retreat dating back 15,000 years, providing valuable insights regarding environmental changes during those times. The findings indicate outlet glaciers fluctuated synchronously over many centuries throughout the Neoglacial period (which covers the last 5.8 thousand years). Two major glaciers in the Southern Ice Field, namely Penguin and Europa, remained relatively stable throughout the Holocene (11.2\u20135.8 thousand years ago), but they fluctuated considerably during the Neoglacial period. At times in the Neoglacial period, glaciers retreated further inland than the present day, providing insight into how these icecaps may respond in the future as CO2 emissions continue to rise.Bethan Davies, a senior lecturer at Newcastle University, specializes in glaciology and glacial geology research. In an email interview with GlacierHub, Davies, who was not associated with the paper, discussed the specifics of glacial sediment core research. She explains that when doing this sort of research, \"the general aim is twofold: to understand a process, and to understand the timing of the process.\" In other words, sediment cores provide important insight regarding the processes of sediment formation, transport and deposition, the environment in which they occurred, and the timescale on which they occurred.Understanding the details sediment cores provide requires \"specialist skills,\" like being able to identify what the sediment colors and composition say about the surrounding environment, according to Davies.Sediment cores have the ability to recreate a geological landscape dating back thousands of years. This is important information, Davies says, for addressing the current climate crisis: \"Glaciers are responding today to climate change, but the observational record is very short. In order to understand how they respond to extremes of climate change we need a longer data set.\"Analyzing sediment cores to determine periods of glacial waning allows scientists to compare their findings with other resources, such as ice cores, to see how the climate responds when glaciers melt and water levels rise. Much of the work on glaciers and climate has occurred in the Alps, Himalayas, and Alaska; recent glacier research in Patagonia, which is quite distant from other research sites, may help determine the similarities and differences in regional patterns.Many Patagonian glaciers have been shrinking since the end of the Little Ice Age about 150 years ago, and increasing rates of melting in recent years have made the Patagonian Ice Sheets one of the largest contributors to sea level rise. Thus, understanding glacial waxing and waning patterns via sediment cores is becoming increasingly important in our ability to respond to a changing climate.

  "answer_squad": " Beaufort Gyre",
  "text": "A new study provides the first observational evidence of the stabilization of the anti-cyclonic Beaufort Gyre, which is the dominant circulation of the Canada Basin and the largest freshwater reservoir in the Arctic Ocean.          The study uses a newly extended record of \"dynamic ocean topography\" satellite data from 2011-2019 provided by two of the co-authors, along with an extensive hydrographic dataset from 2003-2019, to quantify the changing sea surface height of the gyre in recent years.Previous observations and modeling that relied on earlier dynamic ocean topography data up to 2014 have documented that the gyre has strengthened and increased its freshwater content by 40% compared with 1970s climatology. Stabilization of the gyre could be a precursor of a huge freshwater release, which could have significant ramifications including impacting the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a key component of global climate.The Beaufort Gyre \"has transitioned to a quasi-stable state in which the increase in sea surface height of the gyre has slowed and the freshwater content has plateaued. In addition, the cold halocline layer, which isolates the warm/salty Atlantic water at depth, has thinned significantly due to less input of cold and salty water stemming from the Pacific Ocean and the Chukchi Sea shelf, together with greater entrainment of lighter water from the eastern Beaufort Sea. This recent transition of the Beaufort Gyre is associated with a southeastward shift in its location as a result of variation in the regional wind forcing.\"This is according to the journal article \"Recent state transition of the Arctic Ocean's Beaufort Gyre,\" published in Nature Geoscience.\"Our results imply that continued thinning of the cold halocline layer could modulate the present stable state, allowing for a freshwater release,\" the article states. \"This in turn could freshen the subpolar North Atlantic, impacting the AMOC.\"Because there could be many potential local and remote impacts of the changing gyre on the hydrographic structure, physical processes, and ecosystem of the Arctic, \"it is of high interest to better understand the factors associated with such changes\u2014including the underlying causes,\" the article notes.\"People should be aware that changes in the circulation of the Arctic Ocean could threaten the climate. It's not only the melting ice and animals losing their habitat that should be a concern,\" said Peigen Lin, lead author of the paper. Lin, who is an associate professor at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University's School of Oceanography in China, conducted his research as a postdoctoral investigator at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in Massachusetts.                Collecting measurements in the ice, the western Arctic Ocean. Credit: Peigen Lin/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution             With the gyre being the Arctic Ocean's largest freshwater reservoir, \"if that freshwater gets released and ends up spreading into the North Atlantic, it could impact the overturning circulation, and, in an extreme case, disrupt it,\" said co-author Robert Pickart, a senior scientist in WHOI's Department of Physical Oceanography.The study, which includes an examination of long-term trends of the Beaufort Gyre and the causes of the thinning of the cold halocline layer, quantifies the evolution of the gyre in terms of its sea surface height as well as its freshwater content. \"Both of these indicate that the Beaufort Gyre has stabilized in the second decade of this century,\" Lin said.The study also addresses the causes of the halocline thinning considerably as the gyre has evolved. The study notes that the recent decrease in the amount of Pacific origin winter water exiting the Chukchi Sea explains some of the thinning, and that the enhanced influence from the eastern Beaufort Sea\u2014due to the gyre's southeastward shift\u2013 likely also contributes to the thinning.The recent documented state of the gyre \"does not represent a return to the initial condition of 2003 when the gyre was weak and located partially in the southeastern basin. Instead, under the strengthened wind stress curl, the gyre has continuously intensified even though it has contracted, and it has maintained its excess freshwater storage,\" the article notes.                Collecting measurements at the ice edge, the western Arctic Ocean. Credit: Peigen Lin/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution             Lin said a goal regarding the gyre is to understand the mechanisms behind its changes, which ultimately could allow scientists to predict what the gyre might do in the future.\"The community has been confounded by the fact that this gyre has kept growing and growing, and everyone is expecting it to release,\" Pickart said. \"Wouldn't it be something if the gyre system and its freshwater accumulation and release could be become somewhat predictable? Then, perhaps, we could also shed light on what a warming climate is going to do to this system.\" More information:Peigen Lin, Recent state transition of the Arctic Ocean's Beaufort Gyre, Nature Geoscience (2023).

  "text": "A team of environmental engineers at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland and Dalhousie University Halifax in Canada has found that techniques for recycling plastics may inadvertently lead to increased environmental microplastics. In their study, reported in the Journal of Hazardous Materials Advances, the group tested water used to clean plastic at a recycling plant.          By most accounts, plastic recycling efforts have been a resounding failure. Prior research has shown that only 9% of plastic worldwide is recycled\u2014in the U.S., it is only 5%. This is despite millions of people around the world dutifully separating out their plastic bottles; most of them wind up in landfills anyway. And now, it appears that the recycling process itself might be making things worse. In this new effort, the research team received permission to test a plastic recycling plant to see if it was emitting plastic pollution.The problem, the researchers note, is that for plastic to be recycled, it must first be cleaned. This is done by washing it in water several times. The rest of the process involves shredding and melting to create pellets. Prior research has suggested washing may result in the release of microplastics into the water. In this new effort, the group found that the plastic was being washed four times. Each water source was tested to find out how much plastic (in the form of micron-sized particles) remained in the water.The research team found microplastics in all four sources. They also noted that most of the water is routed to sewage systems or directly into the environment at most recycling plants. After adding up all the particles they observed, the team estimated that the facility could be emitting approximately 6.5 million pounds of microplastics into the environment each year.But there was more to the story. The researchers revealed that the facility under study had installed a filtration system, which reduced the number of particles by approximately 50%. However, there was a caveat\u2014the researchers only tested for plastics down to 1.6 microns. Plastic particles can be much smaller than that. Prior research has shown that some can be small enough to make their way into individual cells in an animal's body.

  "text": "New research finds that Canada's electrical and electronic waste (e-waste) has more than tripled in the last two decades, the equivalent of filling the CN tower 110 times and generating close to a million tons in 2020 alone.          The University of Waterloo researchers completed the first comprehensive estimate of e-waste in Canada to understand its lifecycle, from sales of electronic items to e-waste generation. Their findings reveal that the e-waste generation per person has increased from 8.3 kg in 2000 to 25.3 kg in 2020. The e-waste in Canada is expected to continue rising in the near future and underscores the need for proactive forecasts to better manage the evolving electronics sector.\"This study provides useful insights to policymakers for setting up targets for e-waste reduction and recycling to recover valuable resources from e-waste,\" said Komal Habib, professor in the School of Environment, Enterprise and Development. \"E-waste could also help to create a secondary supply chain of critical materials, reducing the risks of potential supply disruptions.\"The estimated growth of e-waste is attributed to consumer habits and Canada's growing population. As the number of households increases, so does consumption. The study found that large household appliances, such as refrigerators and washing machines, dominate the e-waste stream considering mass. However, the less bulky items dominate in quantity; household lighting is the top item, followed by toys and sports equipment, and information technology (IT) and telecommunications equipment, such as cellphones and laptops.There are pros and cons of the expected increase in e-waste for the recycling industry. When it comes to IT and telecommunication equipment, the industry's efforts to make lightweight products are leading to the dilution of precious and critical materials per product, creating a challenge for recyclers to recover. However, increasing quantities of this e-waste could lead to potential incentives for the continuous operation of the recycling industries.\"The findings will be beneficial for stakeholders to explore possible material and revenue generation opportunities from e-waste,\" said Habib. \"For example, it can help electronic manufacturers and recyclers to understand the potential for urban mining, plan for future extractions of critical materials, and identify the need for safe handling of any hazardous materials.\"The study also indicates that more attention should be given to improving repair, refurbishment, and product life extension opportunities rather than focusing solely on recycling and material recovery. In the future, the researchers indicated that assessing consumer behavior data to create a more accurate and complete picture of e-waste management in Canada is necessary to better inform sustainable management practices.The study, \"A first comprehensive estimate of electronic waste in Canada,\" appears in the Journal of Hazardous Materials.

  "answer_squad": " Global Biogeochemical Cycles",
  "text": "In a new pair of studies, a global team of scientists reassessed greenhouse gas emissions stemming from rivers, streams, lakes, and reservoirs. The studies update previous estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from inland water sources at a global scale.          One decade ago, the Regional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes initiative (RECCAP-1) reported that these water bodies could emit as much as 7.7 petagrams of carbon dioxide (CO2) each year. Recently, in a pair of papers by Lauerwald et al published in Global Biogeochemical Cycles, the team introduced the inland water chapter of RECCAP-2. This latest effort synthesizes recent emissions estimates to include two additional greenhouse gases: methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O).The first piece reviews state-of-the-art estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from inland waters. The second pairs those estimates with global inland water surface maps to provide regionalized estimates of greenhouse gas emissions.The study authors found that inland waters contribute 5.5 petagrams of CO2 per year, of which one third emanates from South American rivers. Meanwhile, inland waters emit 82\u2013135 teragrams of CH4 annually, one third of which comes from North American and Russian lakes. N2O emissions were comparatively small at 248\u2013590 gigagrams N2O per year, and a quarter of N2O emissions stem from North American inland waters.Inland waters could represent approximately 20% of the total global CH4 emissions, the authors found. In contrast, the contributions of inland waters to the global CO2 and N2O budgets are relatively minor.These estimates are conservative because they do not include ephemeral water bodies, small wetlands, and water bodies smaller than 0.1 square kilometer, the authors say. Nevertheless, the results will improve climate models and global greenhouse gas budgets while spotlighting natural systems' roles in climate change.

  "text": "For millions of people with seasonal allergies, springtime means runny noses, excessive sneezes and itchy eyes. And, as with many things, climate change appears to be making allergy season even worse.          Researchers reporting in ACS Earth and Space Chemistry have shown that common allergen-producing plants ryegrass and ragweed emit more smaller, \"subpollen particles\" (SPPs) than once thought, yet climate would likely be most affected by their intact pollen grains, which can boost cloud formation.In addition to annoying sinuses, pollen naturally functions as a way for plants to exchange genetic material and reproduce. When exposed to moisture, these pollen grains can burst into tiny SPPs less than a micron long. Their smaller size allows them to reach the lower respiratory system, where they can last longer and cause more inflammation than their larger counterparts.Both SPPs and whole pollen grains are also thought to act as ice nucleation sites\u2014miniature starting points for clouds. But compared to regular clouds, SPPs and pollen form smaller, more numerous clouds that tend to hold onto their precipitation, helping trap in radiant heat and contributing to climate change. In turn, higher temperatures can extend pollen-release periods, further exacerbating the problem.Previously, Brianna Matthews, Alyssa Alsante and Sarah Brooks studied how oak trees emit SPPs at different humidity levels. But this time, the team wanted to investigate how two other common allergen-producing plants, ragweed and ryegrass, release SPPs under humid conditions, and how those particles could affect ice cloud formation.The researchers collected samples of ryegrass and ragweed, then placed them into a specialized \"pollen chamber.\" There, the samples were exposed to different humidity levels and bursts of wind over several hours to simulate real-world conditions.The group assessed the number of SPPs per pollen grain, as well as the abilities of both to nucleate ice. Surprisingly, the team found that previous experiments on the same types of plants underestimated the amount of SPPs by a factor of 10 to 100. This was likely because the other experiments used a less realistic means of spreading the pollen and generating the SPPs, say the researchers.Ragweed and ryegrass SPPs were very poor ice-nucleating sites, however\u2014barely better than plain water\u2014while whole pollen grains facilitated cloud growth. The researchers say that these updated parameters and numbers of emitted pollen grains and particles could ultimately be used to create more-accurate climate models. More information:Brianna H.

As prolonged rains and rising seas continue to raise water table levels, their septic systems are failing, causing wastewater to back up into their homes and creating risks to clean water, ecosystems, and public health.The solution, according to a University of Miami College of Engineering graduate student, lies not solely in connecting existing septic systems to public sewer lines but also in finding alternative adaptation strategies to make those systems more resilient to the effects of climate change.\"Connecting to a municipal sewer line is not always a feasible option, especially for residents who live outside city service areas, so they need to rely on septic to dispose of their home's wastewater,\" said Lamis Amer, a fourth-year industrial engineering doctoral student.\"But today, with more precipitation and flooding raising groundwater levels, some septic systems aren't functioning as they should. So, we need to look at adaptation strategies like mound systems and micro sewer treatment plants to mitigate the risks climate change poses to septic systems.\"Amer has spent the past three years studying those risks and developing a decision-making model that could help communities adapt septic systems in response to climate change.      Her research is part of a study led by her faculty mentor, associate professor Murat Erkoc, who is applying principles of systems engineering to help coastal communities in Florida and elsewhere deal with and mitigate the effects of sea level rise.With about 2.6 million septic tanks in Florida\u2014120,000 in Miami-Dade County alone, according to the environmental nonprofit Miami Waterkeeper\u2014Amer's research couldn't be timelier, she noted.Using records from Miami-Dade's Open Data Hub as well as other publicly available sources, she identified properties in the county that have active septic systems, then designed a resilience index scale of 0 to 1 to determine how resilient those septic systems are to the effects of rising groundwater. She eliminated septic systems that had been abandoned.She used current sea levels rates and examined other data such as a property's proximity to flood-risk zones, finding that nearly 32% of the existing sites in her study have a resilience index below 0.5 and that approximately 18% have a resilience index less than 0.1.\"A resilience index of 1 means that the system is not subject to failure; or if it did malfunction, the likelihood of polluting other freshwater sources would be minimal,\" Amer explained. \"Lower resilience values mean that those systems are not meeting the minimum operating requirements for septic and could already be contaminating groundwater.\"As sea levels continue to rise, septic sites that are currently resilient could be compromised, she warned.Amer said her results, which she plans to share with Miami-Dade and EPA officials, can help inform decisions about which septic sites should be prioritized for adaptation measures.She also hopes to expand her study to examine how climate change is contributing to higher rates of septic system failures in poorer, underserved communities.In a move to safeguard public health and natural areas such as Biscayne Bay, Miami-Dade is already addressing the problem of failing septic systems, implementing its Connect to Protect program aimed at extending sanitary sewer service to residents with septic systems. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava recently detailed that program at the University's Climate and Health Symposium, where Amer's study won first place in a student research competition.For properties that cannot connect to sewer lines, adaptation strategies proposed in her study would be beneficial, she pointed out.The mound system Amer describes is an option for areas with shallow soil depth and high groundwater. Waste from the septic tank flows to a pump chamber, where it is pumped to a mound. Treatment of the wastewater occurs as it is discharged to the trench and filtered through the sand, then dispersed into the native soil.\"Micro sewer treatment systems, also known as community sewer systems, are compact, self-contained wastewater treatment plants that serve a limited number of residences,\" Amer explained.The graduate student, who also has conducted research on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from coal supply chain networks, said industrial and systems engineers can be valuable assets in helping to combat climate change. \"We develop decision models to optimize solutions to problems,\" she said. \"So, our skill set can certainly be applied to tackle problems of a changing climate.\" Provided byUniversity of MiamiCitation:Rising seas are causing septic systems to fail, finds researcher (2023, May 8)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-seas-septic.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "A study led by researchers at Peking University in China suggests that extreme rainfall will significantly threaten global food production due to climate change and the accompanying extreme weather events.          The paper, \"Extreme rainfall reduces one-twelfth of China's rice yield over the last two decades,\" published in the journal Nature Food, used long-term weather observations and multi-level rainfall manipulative experiments to explore the magnitude and mechanisms of extreme rainfall impacts on rice yield.The study found reductions due to extreme rainfall were comparable to those induced by extreme heat over the last two decades, projecting up to 8.1% in lost yield by the year 2100. Jonathan Proctor has published a News & Views article in the same journal issue discussing the study.Researchers designed a comprehensive series of conditional rainfall experiments to isolate the mechanisms related to extreme rainfall impacts. In the experiments, four rainfall levels of intensity and event frequency were used to observe the impacts on three different growth phases; vegetative, reproductive, and ripening.Under various conditions of rain intensity, water volume, plant exposure and nitrogen manipulation, with multiple controls, the researchers could differentiate biophysical and biochemical mechanisms operating on distinct growth phases.Extreme rainfall with high intensity damaged plant tissues directly in some instances. In other scenarios, high-volume rain limited nutrient uptake by washing out or waterlogging soil. There was also a clear sign that during the reproductive phase extreme rainfall was preventing successful pollination.Rainfall simulations across China showed that physical disturbance induced by extreme rainfall was the most critical yield determinant across 47% to 95% of rice sowing areas, accounting for approximately an 8% reduction in yield already, separate from the projected 8.1% reduction by the end of the century. The authors suggest that future farmers of China could choose areas to sow that will be less affected by increases in extreme weather events.A substantial percentage of humans live in China, with more than 18% of all humans calling it home. Conditions that affect the food supply of China have wide-ranging impacts on economies, agriculture and water usage around the world.China currently imports rice from Vietnam, Pakistan, India, Burma, Thailand and is Asia's largest buyer of California rice. Each of these regions will have their own issues with crop yield due to a changing climate, so understanding the mechanisms behind these impacts helps all producers better prepare for an agricultural future that is changing along with the climate.

  "text": "Known around the world as an oasis of overindulgence, the desert city of Las Vegas has emerged as a surprising model of austerity and prudence when it comes to water.          Some 2.3 million people live in the arid Las Vegas Valley, and 40 million tourists are drawn each year to its giant casinos and hotels.Yet because Nevada is allowed to use less than two percent of the drought-hit Colorado River's total water, it has taken drastic action, from banning lawns to capping the size of swimming pools.Even as the region's population has exploded by more than half in the past two decades, use of the mighty but dwindling river\u2014by far Las Vegas's main water source\u2014has declined by almost a third.\"Las Vegas has done a very good job selling the facade of excess and decadence,\" said Bronson Mack, Southern Nevada Water Authority spokesman.\"But the reality is that our community is extremely water-efficient.\"This is due to a package of strict laws, financial incentives and education, created during severe drought in the early 2000s, when Nevada exceeded its river allocation.Now, at a time when federal officials are mulling mandatory cuts across the parched US West, Las Vegas \"has become a water conservation rock star\" and \"a model for cities\" across the region, said researcher Brian Richter.'Water cops'On the Las Vegas Strip, famous casino attractions like the Bellagio's fountains and the Venetian's canals use non-potable groundwater from private wells.                Cameron Donnarumma patrols Las Vegas neighborhoods to check if residents are wasting water.             Out in the sprawling suburbs, early morning \"water patrol\" cars with flashing lights crawl the streets, hunting for broken sprinklers and leaky hoses.Investigators film any violation, before planting a warning flag on the lawn for first-time offenders, or logging a fine for repeat transgressors.Some homeowners become \"a bit frustated\" to find \"water cops\" on their lawn before dawn, said investigator Cameron Donnarumma, but most are cooperative.Indeed, his work relies on residents reporting their more water-profligate neighbors via an app, which daily yields 20-50 home visits by patrols.\"People recognize when you land in Las Vegas in the Mojave Desert it is a very dry place,\" said Mack. \"It is a different environment from where you came from.\"By 2027, any watering of \"non-functional\" grass\u2014there purely for aesthetic rather than recreational reasons\u2014will be banned, except at single-family residences.Las Vegas offers homeowners $3 for every square foot of grass they remove and replace with water-efficient alternatives, like drip-irrigated plants.It is a program that has been copied in other major US cities, such as Los Angeles and Phoenix, though smaller towns find it harder to emulate, said Richter.\"Smaller budgets and limited ability to offer financial incentives in smaller cities can severely constrain\" water conservation programs, he wrote in a recent study.                Las Vegas offers homeowners $3 for every square foot of grass they remove and replace with water-efficient alternatives, like drip-irrigated plants.             'Political'The programs are not always popular.Tedi Vilardo, a Las Vegas stay-at-home mom, told AFP she has complied with new rules limiting her to watering her lawn for 12 minutes, but is \"seeing a ton of dead spots.\"\"I'm gonna go against the rules,\" she said, noting that \"we got lots of rain\" this winter.She dislikes fake grass, because she has two children and \"it burns their feet.\"A recent rule limiting new swimming pools to 600 square feet (56 square meters) has infuriated contractors like Kevin Kraft, who designs giant pools for wealthy homeowners.The industry was not consulted until the legislation was a \"done deal,\" and Kraft says a cap based on percentage of a home's total lot size would save more water.Nevada officials were \"under the gun\" from the federal government and \"had to show savings,\" he said.\"A lot of it is political,\" he added.Even so, Kraft described Southern Nevada's water conservation as \"world class.\"\"Now, the other states such as California? It's not even close,\" he said.                Las Vegas returns water to Lake Mead, the nation's largest reservoir, via the Las Vegas Wash.             'Step up'The rules limiting Nevada's access to the Colorado River, which supplies water to 40 million people including California's cities and giant farms, were drawn up in 1922.Back then, Las Vegas \"barely even existed,\" said Mack, and was \"just a whistlestop for the train between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City.\"Now, with water levels plummeting at nearby Lake Mead\u2014the nation's largest reservoir\u2014federal officials are planning steep cuts across the West.These will either be a uniform percentage reduction for all states, or by \"senior rights\"\u2014basically, who got there first, which would put Nevada near the back of the line.Mack said Las Vegas's record of water reductions \"could actually be a challenge for us in the future\" if mandated cuts are based on current usage levels.Las Vegas \"should get credit for the amount of water that we have already saved in this community over the past 20 years,\" he said.\"Other communities are just now starting to step up to the conservation plate.\"    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:The 'water cops' of Las Vegas make city a model in drought-hit US (2023, May 8)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-cops-las-vegas-city-drought-hit.html  This document is subject to copyright.

At least 394 bodies have been recovered after last week's floods, said Thomas Bakenga, administrator of Kalehe territory where the affected villages are located.He had announced a toll of at least 203 people on Saturday.Heavy rainfall in the Kalehe region of South Kivu province on Thursday caused rivers to overflow, triggering landslides that engulfed the villages of Bushushu and Nyamukubi.The hillside also gave way at Nyamukubi, where the weekly market was held on Thursday, Bakenga has previously said.\"It's like the end of the world. I'm looking for my parents and my children,\" Gentille Ndagijimana said, tears in her eyes.The 27-year-old and her family had sought refuge in Nyamukubi after fleeing fighting in neighbouring North Kivu province between army forces and rebels in January.Now, she has lost her two children, two sisters and parents, while her husband is injured and in hospital.\"I no longer have a family and I don't have a field. Now, I have to look for somewhere to sleep,\" she added.Mud and stones fill one neighbourhood, where homes, a market, two schools, a health centre, community hall and warehouse once stood\u2014now all gone.Bakenga told AFP on Sunday by telephone that there were now \"more than 390 bodies recovered\".He said that 142 bodies were discovered at Bushushu, 132 at Nyamukubi and 120 had been found floating on Lake Kivu near Idjwi, an island in the middle of the large volcanic lake.\"Since Thursday we've been finding bodies every minute and we are burying them,\" Bakenga said.National mourningThe provincial government has sent a boat filled with beans, flour and other food, tarpaulins and medicine, he said.In all, several villages were submerged, many houses washed away, and fields devastated, when rivers in the region burst their banks due to the heavy rains.\"Out of 11 people in the family, only two remain,\" Roger Bahavu, a father of seven, told AFP.He went out to see friends after work and returned home later to find it and his family gone.Isaac Habamungu, a Red Cross worker in the area, said there was no funding for the recovery effort.Teams were digging \"with hands and some shovels\" to search for bodies, he said.A day of national mourning will be observed on Monday, with flags lowered at half-mast \"in memory of the lost compatriots\", the government announced.It also said it would deploy a government mission to support provincial authorities in dealing with the \"disaster\".Doctors Without Borders (MSF) also said it had sent an emergency team to the scene on Saturday.Eastern DR Congo's disaster came two days after floods killed at least 131 people and destroyed thousands of homes in neighbouring Rwanda, which lies on the other side of Lake Kivu.On Saturday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres offered his condolences to the victims of the \"catastrophic floods\" in Rwanda and DR Congo.\"This is yet another illustration of accelerating climate change and its disastrous impact on countries that have done nothing to contribute to global warming,\" he said during a visit to Burundi.Experts say extreme weather events are happening with increased frequency and intensity due to climate change.Last month, a landslide provoked by torrential downpours killed around 20 people in North Kivu, a province that neighbours South Kivu.DR Congo, a vast nation the size of continental western Europe, is one of the poorest countries in the world, riddled by corruption and conflict in its east.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Toll from DR Congo floods rises to nearly 400: official (2023, May 8)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-toll-dr-congo.html  This document is subject to copyright.

For the past three months, much of the kingdom has been choking on dangerous air pollution, with smoke from forest fires and farmers burning crop stubble suffocating northern Chiang Mai and cloaking the capital with hazardous smog.Despite the region facing recent record-breaking heatwaves and worsening flooding due in part to rising sea levels, green movements have gained little traction with Thai voters.\"People acknowledge it but they have no hope that politicians can solve this problem,\" Green Party leader and founder Phongsa Choonaem told AFP while he campaigned for the May 14 vote.As he distributed tree leaves rather than paper flyers to bemused bystanders, he said the public's understanding of environmental issues was improving.But the party is fielding just a handful of candidates for the 500-seat lower house.\"We are not aiming for the prime minister position, we want to solve the environmental problem,\" said Phongsa.'Public health crisis'Thailand's election is gearing up to be a clash between reformist movements\u2014the Pheu Thai and Move Forward parties\u2014and establishment outfits like Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP) and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-Cha's new United Thai Nation Party.                Despite Southeast Asia being among the most vulnerable regions in the world to climate change, green movements have gained little traction with voters.             But alongside the circus of parties vying to outbid each other with populist welfare policies, environmental issues have been a sideshow.Move Forward has rolled out proposals to drive growth and reduce carbon emissions, including agricultural subsidies and promoting electric vehicle technology, while Pheu Thai has pledged to stop the stubble burning within a year.Pheu Thai\u2014along with PPRP, and the Democrat Party\u2014has also backed a version of the Clean Air Act, initially drafted and proposed by the citizen think tank Clean Air Network (CAN).\"This is a real public health crisis,\" said CAN's Weenarin Lulitanonda, noting that about two million people have needed hospital treatment this year because of air pollution.She cautiously welcomed politicians finally talking about the issue, but characterised many of their election promises as \"loosey-goosey\" in detail.Delivering results in the form of legislation is what will count, she said.A long-time campaigner on air pollution, Weenarin said voters' growing awareness of the issue was encouraging, but warned against framing it as a choice between the environment on one side and economic growth, healthcare and democracy on the other.\"These things can be done in parallel, because maintaining your health and being alive is a really important precondition for any other issue that you care about,\" she said.                Smoke from forest fires and farmers burning crop stubble has suffocating northern Chiang Mai and cloaked Bangkok with hazardous smog.             \"This is something that has to be above political or business interests, whether that's the case or not is to be seen.\"Hampering substantive change is Thailand's system of political patronage, in which wealthy clans leverage links to further their business interests, said Danny Marks, assistant professor of environmental politics and policy at Dublin City University.Air pollution is blamed on poor rural farmers burning their crops, he said, but they are paid by huge multinational Thai firms.\"Those who benefit basically from everyone breathing the bad air, unfortunately, are those who are quite close to the government,\" Marks told AFP.He noted that even leading opposition parties like Pheu Thai had never prioritised air pollution or environmental issues.\"I think they have always been allied to big business,\" Marks said.      'Hear us'The northern city of Chiang Mai, long a favourite with backpackers, has this year earned an unenviable international reputation for poor air quality, regularly beating notorious hotspots such as Beijing and Delhi in the list of most polluted cities.                Alongside the circus of parties vying to outbid each other with populist welfare policies, environmental issues have been a sideshow.             Verapol Charasirilert was studying in Chiang Mai but returned to Bangkok because the pollution was so bad.\"I don't think political parties have enough policies on the environment,\" the 19-year-old told AFP, saying he planned to vote for Move Forward.An ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute climate report late last year found 66 percent of Thais felt political parties did not prioritise climate change enough.On the front line of the public health crisis caused by pollution, Chiang Mai cardiologist Rungsrit Kanjanavanit agreed.\"The policymakers need to understand the science and they need to realise the importance of it,\" he told AFP.\"People have been yelling, screaming a lot so they are beginning to hear us.\"    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Thailand chokes on pollution but greens struggle to be heard in election (2023, May 8)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-thailand-pollution-greens-struggle-heard.html  This document is subject to copyright.

Dr. Domenico Vicinanza, a Senior Lecturer at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, England, is a leading expert in data sonification, which is the process of converting scientific measurements into sound, and the event will be the first time that data sonification using live geophysical data has been attempted on stage.During the performance at the 2023 Internet2 Community Exchange conference in Atlanta, Georgia, which brings together universities and researchers from across the United States and beyond, Dr. Vicinanza will access seismographic data being recorded by the US Geological Survey in Yellowstone National Park.The music will be produced live on stage with the help of a computer program developed by Dr. Vicinanza, which will map the seismographic data to musical notes. It will then be performed by Dr. Alyssa Schwartz, Visiting Assistant Professor of Flute and Musicology at Fairmont State University.Yellowstone is one of the most seismically active areas of the United States, with as many as 3,000 earthquakes recorded annually. Earthquakes at Yellowstone often occur in \"swarms\", with many happening in a short space of time.This element of chance makes it impossible to predict what the music will sound like, and the duo are ready for whatever nature throws at them.Dr. Vicinanza, who in addition to his role at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) is the coordinator for the arts and humanities at G\u00c9ANT, the European network for research and education, said, \"We have absolutely no idea how the music will turn out.\"Using my program I'll be converting the data to musical notes and if there's significant seismic activity and big spikes in the data we're receiving at that time, the music will be incredibly dramatic. Equally it could be quite serene, so it's a huge artistic challenge for Alyssa to interpret, and it's really Alyssa who will be taking all the risks.\"Alyssa won't be able to change any note, but she will be able to interpret the piece of music created before her eyes, and she will be able to creatively use speed, articulation, or make certain parts softer or louder. It might be really difficult to play, but that's what makes it exciting, and Alyssa is incredibly brave to be doing this in front of a live audience.\"Dr. Vicinanza's ongoing work with Yellowstone National Park is the first time the US National Parks Service has recognized music as a research output. He will visit Yellowstone next year to capture his own recordings among the hot springs and geysers, but in the meantime he's delighted to have this opportunity to bring scientific data from the country's oldest national park to a wider audience.Dr. Vicinanza added, \"By being able to 'perform' what would otherwise be viewed on a graph, we're able to bring the power of nature to life and help more people experience the natural wonders of Yellowstone.\"Music, and sound in general, can be a really useful way of experiencing science\u2014for scientists as well as the general public. After all, our ears are much more sensitive to small changes than our eyes.\"Every pattern, spike, or sudden change in the music is a direct representation of what is happening at that spot in Yellowstone at that time. Rather than just looking at a seismograph we can listen to it, and that's an incredible thing.\" Provided byAnglia Ruskin UniversityCitation:Will Yellowstone's geology produce rock music?

  "text": "The Middle East and North African region lose about $13 billion a year because of increasing sand and dust storms. By combining learnings from artificial intelligence and 3000-year-old sustainable methods, researchers might be on the way to finding out how to mitigate the damages.          Sand and dust storms cause damage to crops, human and animal health, buildings and infrastructure, and force shutdowns for several weeks. There are natural sources of these storms, but also human-induced factors have added to the problem in the last decades.Hossein Hashemi, Associate Professor in Water Resource Engineering, and the Center for Advanced Middle Eastern Studies at Lund University, has been studying the causes and trends for several years.His research provides further understanding of the challenges, but also some possible solutions:\"We must look at these issues from a multidisciplinary perspective, adding socio-political, economical, and management aspects to the technical and natural science-based facts. There is much to learn from traditional practices that are naturally adapted to the ecosystems and use sustainable methods,\" says Hossein Hashemi.Sand and dust storms are more frequent todayThe highest density of dust sources in the Middle East is in Iraq between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and along the Syria-Iraq border. This is the focus area for Hossein Hashemi\u00b4s current research which also includes neighboring T\u00fcrkiye and Iran.The natural sources of sand and dust storms are mainly deserts and dry lands. In the hot months in the summertime, the strong north-easterly winds carry large amounts of particles across the region.However, these storms are becoming more frequent, they span over longer periods of time and spread to a wider area. Climate change is likely a driver, but also anthropogenic factors such as more abandoned agricultural land, water management upstream, migration to urban areas, and depopulation caused by conflicts and war.\"The environmental data from the area related to climate change and human activities are scarce and not sufficient for strong conclusions on this correlation,\" says Hossein Hashemi.However, Hossein Hashemi and his team monitor the development over time, using input from both remote sensing and advanced data modeling, allowing him to study various changes and time periods separately to define probable causes and effects.\"There is less water inflow to the lakes and marshlands in the Middle East due to factors such as dam constructions upstream and climate change. With the support of artificial intelligence and satellite data, we can define areas where we see that land is more susceptible to becoming new dust sources,\" explains Hossein Hashemi.The entire region is now mapped using artificial intelligence, and adding to the spatial analysis, the novelty of the project run by Hossein Hashemi and his team is that with temporal changes, they can dynamically show how dust sources vary over time.\"Next, we want to relate these dust sources to socio-political changes. We are looking into the relationship between land use changes and war in the region, especially in Iraq. How has the war affected the land use, and has these changes led to the transformation of lands into dust sources,\" says Hossein Hashemi.      Correlations of dust sources and causes from warThe research team that brings perspectives from natural geography, sociology, and engineering, has recently published a study of the lakes in the area. Poor water management and drought periods have caused them to shrink and become potential dust sources.Now, the team will look at a more detailed analysis of land use over the last twenty years and correlations with another map that shows the effects of war.\"We have data about how many people have been killed in some regions, which is also a cause for more abandoned land. We want to see the correlation with regards to land use with our dust source map and war map,\" says Hossein Hashemi.As more of the soil is turning into sand and water shortages are increasing, many villagers in Iraq have been forced to move into cities. The stress on land and people are challenges that can cause unrest and add to the already conflicted area.Learning from a 3000-year-old qanat systemThe next step is to look at possible solutions. Again, by using artificial intelligence to apply different management scenarios and see what could improve the situation or at least mitigate the effects.There are agreements on water collaboration between the countries in the region, but they are not always followed. The old system of qanats has become interesting as a complement due to its resilience and sustainable way of harvesting water.The qanat is a traditional water harvesting and conveyance system that is more than 3000 years old, originated in Persia. It consists of a network of underground channels that use gravity to bring groundwater from so-called aquifers up to the surface. These can span over many kilometers, and on the surface, the water can be carried further in an open channel and distributed for agricultural use or for drinking water.\"Nature-based solutions may increase local water supply. Using water harvesting systems, such as floodwater spreading and qanat, there could be less impact on environmental water and surface water supplies, such as lakes and marshlands. Studies have shown that dried areas of lakes, such as Urmia and Therthar, are primary sources of emerging dust storms in the Middle East,\" says Hossein Hashemi.Loss of water is a risk to biodiversity and food securityModern water infrastructure and rural depopulation have reduced the use of qanats, and so some have dried up or are not well maintained. However, in some regions, communities still rely on them as the main source of water supply.The water flow in a qanat is controlled by the level of the water table. It can not cause a significant drawdown of the underground aquifer, thus making it a sustainable way to harvest water. As the qanats are underground there is little loss of water to evaporation. The system also has advantages as it is less sensitive to variations from wet to dry years.\"Loss of water means loss of biodiversity and a loss of resources for food security. Lake Urmia, not far from the Tigris and Euphrates River basin, has now become a dust source. The depletion of natural resources causes risks for society. That is why we need to work with these matters from a multidisciplinary view, and the solutions need to take both human well-being and nature into consideration,\" concludes Hossein Hashemi.

  "text": "The implementation of effective policies at local and regional level, and the cooperation of all countries in the Mediterranean Sea basin is urgently needed to successfully reverse the environmental problems in this marine area.          This is evidenced by a report carried out by the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology of the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (ICTA-UAB) presented in the European Parliament by oceanographer Patrizia Ziveri, who stresses the need to urgently fight against the growing pollution caused by marine litter and plastics in the Mediterranean, to improve current legislation and to monitor new pollutants that require immediate regulation.The study, requested by the Committee on Regional Development (REGI) Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies of the European Parliament, provides an exhaustive analysis of the current situation of the Mediterranean Sea, a global pollution hotspot, as well as the actions taken by the cities and regions of the Mediterranean countries of the European Union to reduce the generation and dispersion of marine pollutants. The study makes policy recommendations and points out that pollution affects both marine environment and fauna, as well as human health.The Mediterranean is one of the world's marine areas under human pressure. Its high rates of population and urbanization (150 million inhabitants on its coasts), industrial activity, tourism (one third of the world's volume) and fishing have led to a rapid increase in pollution. It accounts for up to 30% of global shipping activity. This, combined with a geomorphological configuration in the form of a semi-enclosed basin and its specific oceanic circulation, has made the Mediterranean Sea one of the most polluted spots on the planet and a natural trap for marine litter, mainly plastics.Between 80 and 90 percent of marine litter in the basin is plastic, and an estimated 230,000 tons of land-sourced plastic leak into the sea each year. Tourism is the main sector contributing to beach litter (up to 60%) followed by fishing and aquaculture (5-10%). Only 10 types of items account for 66.4% of the beach litter in the Mediterranean Sea, 9 of them are made partly or entirely of plastic, and 7 of them of single-use plastic. Cigarette butts and cigarette filters are the most common (27.3%). Shipping activities are estimated to contribute up to 20,000 tons of plastic per year.      The ICTA-UAB report, \"Actions of cities and regions in the Mediterranean Sea area to fight sea pollution,\" indicates that the main cause of this situation is the massive waste generation and its mismanagement. Other causes include industrial and urban waste discharge, sewage, agricultural run-off, shipping, fishing, and maritime traffic, as well as tourism.\"To tackle pollution, management policies must be applied to waste reduction and treatment, tourism, pollution from plastics and other pollutants, sewage and other waste from rivers,\" explains Patrizia Ziveri, oceanographer at ICTA-UAB. It is necessary to target the production model, consumption patterns and waste disposal practices.In this context, \"it is essential that the fight against pollution in the Mediterranean Sea is endorsed not only by EU countries, but that regulations are implemented by all Mediterranean countries through effective cooperation\", she says. The implementation and success of the actions to fight marine pollution should be monitored at different stages. Best practices should be highlighted, shared, and implemented in different suitable Mediterranean regions.The scientists stress that significant progress has been made in terms of treatment and prevention, including the implementation of the single-use plastic directive and the promotion of recycling. However, more and continued efforts are needed. The study examines the implementation of the EU's single-use plastics directive in France, Spain, Italy, and Greece, and calls for a strategy to reduce plastics which includes market restrictions, improved waste management and agreements between consumers and producers.\"Efforts to reduce the use of plastics must continue in order to meet environmental targets. There is an urgent need to focus on the EU's strategy targets for key sectors, such as consumption patterns, production, and waste management,\" says Michael Grelaud, ICTA-UAB oceanographer and co-author of the report.\"Some actions to limit marine-based pollution (fisheries, aquaculture, shipping, mining) already exist, but they often face challenges in terms of effective implementation because this is often reduced to voluntary collaborations by states,\" says Jorge Pato, also co-author of the report.Some of the other measures they propose in different areas are:Emerging pollutants. This refers to new pollutants such as pharmaceuticals, UV filters, flame retardants or pesticides that reach the sea through agricultural, urban and industrial runoff or coastal wastewater treatment plants.Microplastics. They point out that there are no regulations for the growing problem of microplastics. \"Microplastic pollution should be established as a priority issue in the Mediterranean agenda, capable of leading to binding agreements\". They point to the establishment of bans and reduction targets in the manufacture of fabrics and cosmetics, monitoring the entry of microplastics into the sea in all water-channels, including rivers and sewage outflows. Strict regulation of ship paint and antifouling coatings is needed.Marine noise pollution. Shipping, oil and gas exploration, construction and maintenance of offshore structures, and military activities are a dangerous source of noise pollution affecting marine fauna, causing behavioral disturbances, communication disruption, hearing damage, stress and even death. They propose the creation of particularly sensitive sea areas where noise levels are restricted (with special attention to migratory routes, breeding grounds and biodiversity hotspots), the use of quieter ship models and the reduction of ship speeds.Rivers, wastewater treatment and harbors. The challenge in managing water pollution lies in the implementation of policies by the signatory countries. This is particularly evident given the varying levels of economic development among the Mediterranean nations. They are committed to the cyclical reuse of treated effluent for agriculture to reduce spending on fertilizers and the recovery of organic wastewater from urban areas as a valuable agricultural resource.Aquaculture. Pollutes by discharging untreated waste, using chemicals, and releasing excess nutrients. This harms aquatic life, promotes harmful algal blooms, and poisons fish and other marine species with antibiotics and heavy metals, so regulation of these excess nutrients in aquaculture is needed. EU policies for Mediterranean countries should implement the Voluntary Guidelines on the Marking of Fishing Gear to eliminate abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear and encourage the recovery of marine litter through compensation.Implementation of initiatives in coastal cities on waste characterization and monitoring. Examples include the use of smart waste bins that alert waste management teams when they are full; awareness-raising campaigns oriented to beach users; monitoring of debris and litter on the main commercial routes in the Mediterranean or the adaptation of packaging that is not possible to ban with alternative sustainable solutions.Mediterranean islands. Promote sustainable tourism; limit the generation of coastal litter by improving general awareness of the problem; limit the impact of tourism by introducing a visiting fee for litter-free coastal attractions; develop comprehensive waste management plans with the involvement of local communities; and introduce regulations to create smoke-free beaches.More information:Report: www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData \u2026 U(2023)733123_EN.pdfProvided byAutonomous University of BarcelonaCitation:Researchers demand European Parliament take action to fight pollution in the Mediterranean Sea (2023, May 5)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-demand-european-parliament-action-pollution.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "The Okinawa Trough is a newly formed back-arc basin located in the outer margin of the continental shelf of the East China Sea. The submarine hydrothermal activities are widely developed in the Okinawa Trough. A typical feature of the basin is that the hydrothermal fluids are highly rich in CO2.          An increasing number of studies suggest that CO2 in hydrothermal fluids may come directly from magmatic degassing. However, the process of CO2 degassing in the Okinawa Trough magmas is poorly understood, and it is unclear whether the magma can release enough CO2 into the hydrothermal system.Recently, Dr. Zhang Yuxiang of Prof. Zeng Zhigang's team from the Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IOCAS), in collaboration with Prof. Glenn Gaetani from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, selected volcanic rock samples from the areas near the hydrothermal fields of the southern Okinawa Trough, analyzed the volatile compositions (CO2, H2O, S, F, Cl) in mineral-hosted melt inclusions and matrix glass using ion probe, and discussed the process of magmatic degassing.The study was published in Lithos on March 23.The researchers found that the CO2 contents in the matrix glass and some of the melt inclusions were very low (< 10 ppm), the CO2 contents positively correlated with water contents, and the CO2 contents in the matrix glass were even lower than the instrumental detection limit (< 1 ppm). On the one hand, this ruled out the possibility that CO2 came from leaching the basement rocks. On the other hand, it suggested the magma had experienced an intense CO2 degassing process.                Fig. 2 Plots of H2O/Ce versus B isotope (\u03b411B). Credit: IOCAS             They estimated that at this level of CO2 degassing, 1 km3 of magma could support a high CO2 flux of hydrothermal vents for more than 500 years. Therefore, from the perspective of magmatic degassing, this study illustrates that magma is an important potential source of CO2 for hydrothermal system.The researchers also found that the magma in the Okinawa Trough also underwent a certain degree of S degassing, but the halogens (F and Cl) did not change significantly during the magma degassing.\"These understandings can provide research support for investigating the material correlation between the magmatic system and the hydrothermal system in the subduction zone,\" said Dr. Zhang, first author of the study.In addition, melt inclusion analysis and plagioclase hydrometer were combined to estimate magma water content and its variation from the modern arc front to the back-arc spreading centers. Together with data from the Mariana and Tonga subduction zones and the mid-ocean ridge basalts, a good positive correlation between H2O/Ce and boron isotope (\u03b411B) were established for volcanic rocks in subduction zones.Boron isotope is an effective indicator of subducted serpentine, which is very rich in water and is considered an important source of fluid in subduction zone. This correlation also indicates that fluids derived from subducted serpentine have an important contribution to the water budget of arc magma.

  "answer_squad": " incomplete maps of where these forests are found",
  "text": "Old-growth forests are of exceptional importance for biodiversity and climate protection in Europe, but they are increasingly rare. Despite the European Union's (EU) pledge in its Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, legislation to protect old-growth remnants still has not been implemented in many member states. Old-growth forest loss continues at alarming rates.          A new commentary in Science argues that comprehensive mapping of old-growth forests\u2014and an immediate moratorium on logging where these are most likely to occur\u2014is urgently required to stop the loss of these unique forests.Old-growth forests are under high and rising pressure in many parts of the world, including Europe. In most EU countries, very few old-growth forests remain, and they are typically small and isolated. While the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 mandates their legal protection, an international team of scientists warns in a new commentary published in Science that despite this, old-growth forests loss continues unabated.\"These forests are critical for biodiversity conservation; many endangered species depend on them, including wolves, lynx and bears, and a myriad of beetles and fungi,\" explains Dr. Mikol\u00e1\u0161 from the Czech University of Life Sciences, Prague, the lead author of the article. \"They also store vast amounts of carbon, so they offer a natural solution against climate change. Despite their importance, we are currently failing to protect this natural heritage. Urgent action is required to better protect old-growth forests before it is too late.\"According to the researchers, a key barrier to better old-growth forests conservation is incomplete maps of where these forests are found. \"We urgently need a systematic mapping effort to generate the basis for the sufficient protection of old-growth forests,\" co-author Prof. Tobias Kuemmerle from Humboldt-University Berlin in Germany, argues. \"Without this, old-growth forests might be logged before they are identified. Or these forests might be logged because they are locally still relatively widespread, and their outstanding conservation value from a European perspective is overlooked.\"While their remoteness often protected old-growth forests in the past, this has changed recently. \"Logging old-growth forests offers higher profit for forest owners than to protect them,\" adds Dr. Miroslav Svoboda, a co-author from the Czech University of Life Sciences. \"Timber prices are high and stricter protection is on the horizon. At the same time, owners are currently not sufficiently compensated for conserving their forests. All this translates into a high incentive to log old-growth forests now, before regulation tightens.\" The authors note that this is already happening in many countries, including Romania and Sweden.\"The last remaining old-growth forests are disappearing before our very eyes, and this is in strong contradiction with the EU biodiversity targets,\" Tobias Kuemmerle explains. \"But we have all the tools to halt this loss.\" According to the researchers, what is needed is equitable financial compensation for forest owners when they manage their old-growth forests sustainably so that they keep their ecological value. The EU should immediately adopt a logging moratorium on areas potentially containing old-growth forests, so that they do not disappear before they are even identified. Finally, there must be a binding requirement that member states include old-growth forest protection in their national strategies.\"Successful examples exist,\" says co-author Prof. Gianluca Piovesan from University of Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy. \"Eighteen countries in Europe have been collaborating for years now to strictly protect over 100,000 hectares of old-growth beech forests.\" This effort has led to the creation of the world's largest UNESCO heritage site. \"The time to act is now,\" adds Dr. Mikol\u00e1\u0161. \"We must take the necessary steps to safeguard this irreplaceable natural heritage for future generations.\" More information:Martin Mikol\u0101\u0161 et al, Protect old-growth forests in Europe now, Science (2023).

  "text": "A changing climate is upon us, with more frequent land and marine heatwaves, forest fires, atmospheric rivers and floods. For some, it is the backdrop to day-to-day life, but for a growing number of people it is a life-changing reality.          It is now more remarkable when a year is not the hottest since our species began to develop civilizations.Whenever we experience extreme climate events, it can be hard to engage with the concept that they are minor blips in the planetary experiment we are conducting. But the main act is taking place elsewhere in the oceans, which soak up more than 90% of the excess heat energy.We are winding up a clockwork spring without knowing exactly when, how fast and how it will unspool. Ocean heating is not so much a canary in a coal mine but a thrashing shark we've inadvertently (at least initially) hauled up into our fishing boat.A bonfire of recordsA drop in the area covered by sea ice, both in the Arctic and more recently also in Antarctica, is one of the latest record-breaking changes. These floating expanses of frozen seawater are central to how our world works. They regulate how much light our planet reflects, help ventilate the oceans, and host important ecosystems in the form of algal meadows on their underside.But now, due to the warming of the ocean, we have the lowest sea ice area ever recorded.Ocean scientists are not used to thinking of rapid change, but the trajectory of the global average temperature on the surface of the ocean has now entered uncharted territory\u2014and fast.We know about the scale of this thanks to satellite technology that can sense small changes in temperature at the ocean surface.These surface data are just that: the temperature of the very skin of the ocean. To get a sense of warming in the deeper ocean, we use ship-based measurements and a fleet of underwater robots known as Argo.      The global ocean heat transportThe deep ocean is clearly changing. This is because polar sea ice acts as a connector between the atmosphere, the surface of the ocean and deeper waters. With less sea ice, there is less cold, salty, oxygenated water sinking to the deep ocean.                What satellites measure can differ from temperatures just below the surface or in the deeper ocean. Author provided, CC BY-ND These freezing coastal waters of Antarctica are a crucial engine room for global currents that convey energy around the planet\u2014and this ocean transport mechanism is now changing.One of the unknowns of ocean warming is how the oceans will adjust and store all the heat. Heating the ocean surface makes the upper reaches more stable. This in turn changes how the upper ocean absorbs carbon dioxide.The difficulty for researchers determining how best to respond is that the processes that move and mix this heat operate over very small scales. It is beyond even our most powerful climate simulators to model exactly how the heat is spread, making predictions less certain.Even if our models could work at very big and very small scales at the same time, they would have few data for validation. This is because very little of the ocean's mixing has been observed directly.While we can predict some of this mixing, the ocean is full of surprises. Recently, the Drake Passage has been shown to be even more of a mixing hotspot than previously thought.A warming PacificDespite the connected ocean, the individual basins have their own characteristics and contributions to climate. Aotearoa New Zealand sits in the southwest corner of the Pacific Ocean, which covers about a third of the globe's surface.The Pacific is so large it has its own internal cycles, such as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We have to disentangle these to understand long-term changes.While El Ni\u00f1o conditions can bring marine heatwaves to some areas of the Pacific, the oceans around Aotearoa New Zealand, especially to the south, are already experiencing nearly constant marine heatwaves.The scale of the oceanic contribution to storing heat means any small change to how this has operated over the past millennia may have very large impacts. It is impossible to overstate the urgency with which we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Technologies that can capture already emitted carbon dioxide have many proponents, but they must not come at the expense of efforts to turn off emission sources. Without removing the drivers of emissions, these stop-gap measures will only delay the inevitable.

  "text": "Think back to September last year. What happened early that month? What news shook the world and reverberated for weeks, if not months?          That's a question I've been asking friends and colleagues lately.On September 8, 2022, at 6.30pm in Britain, Buckingham Palace announced the death of Queen Elizabeth II. The news broke just 30 minutes before the press embargo lifted on a major review of climate change tipping points in the journal Science.The paper in Science was truly earth-shattering, as it heralded changes that could threaten the future of civil society on this planet. But it was the other news that captured the world's attention.So, in case you missed it, I'd like to alert you to this important paper by British climate researcher David Armstrong McKay and colleagues.Grappling with tipping pointsThe question of when global warming might push elements of the climate system past points of no return has come into focus over last the decade or so. And tipping points once thought to be far off in the distance have come into sharp relief.The research examines major features of the global climate system, such as ice sheets, glaciers, rainforests and coral reefs. It asks when melting of ice sheets on Greenland and West Antarctica would become irreversible, ultimately contributing many meters to sea level. Or when thawing of frozen ground in the Arctic might start producing so much methane and carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) that it blows the global emissions budget.Amazonian forest die-back is another major part of the Earth's climate system. Global heating and regional reductions in rainfall could cause trees to die, releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases. Fewer trees ultimately means less rainfall for those that remain, creating a vicious cycle.The pivotal paper in Science reviewed more than 220 papers published since 2008 to estimate what level of global temperature rise (relative to pre-industrial levels) would trigger each of the global and regional climate tipping points.The world has already warmed 1.1\u2103 (see the horizontal line \"current warming\" in the chart above). The 1.5\u2103 and 2\u2103 lines represent the Paris Agreement on climate change targets agreed to internationally in 2016.Climate Tipping Points: The Point of No Return? A Quick Guide.Once initiated, irreversible melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet would add about 5m to global sea level. Disturbingly, the threshold for this tipping point may have already been crossed. If not, it is \"very likely\" to be crossed at 2\u2103.Ice sheets in West Antarctica contain about another 3.5m of sea level rise, and again, irreversible melting is likely to begin at around 2\u2103.So, that's about 5m from Greenland and another 3.5m from West Antarctica. Add thermal expansion from warming oceans, and mountain glacier melt, and we have more than 10m of sea level rise to contend with.While that will unfold over many centuries, it will be irreversible and inexorable. It means children born today will likely see sea levels rise by well over 1m early in the 22nd century. Longer-term, these changes will shape the planet for the next 150,000 years or so, until the next ice age.Consider how 10m of sea level rise might change the map at ClimateCentral.Much of the world's tropical coral reefs will likely die at 1.5\u2103 to 2\u2103 of warming. And thawing of Arctic permafrost would start releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases, equal to about 10% of human emissions. That would likely push global temperature up by another 0.5\u2103 to 1.0\u2103 (on top of 2\u2103).Thankfully, logging and wildfire aside, the Amazon forest looks relatively safe until about 3\u2103 of warming. But the combination of some of those other tipping points might get us there, setting off a further cascade of tipping points.      Can we avoid disaster?After decades of delay, our chances of keeping global warming below 1.5\u2103 are pretty slim. But, clearly, this research shows that limiting warming to 2\u2103 will not keep us safe.The focus on \"net zero by 2050\" has in fact done us a disservice. If we let emissions remain anywhere near current levels for much longer, by 2030 we will have used up the carbon emissions budget that would allow us to stay near 1.5\u2103.We need to act quickly and at least halve current emissions by 2030 on the way to net zero before 2050. This research shows that failing to do so will trigger 10m or more of sea level rise. That will gradually displace hundreds of millions of people and many of the world's major cities.                Global warming threshold estimates for climate tipping elements, ranging from the minimum in yellow where tipping is possible, through to maximum in dark red where tipping is very likely, central dotted line is the best estimate. Compare to the Paris Agreement range of 1.5\u2103 to <2\u2103 (green horizontal bar). Future projections are shown in more detail in (B) along with estimated 21st century warming trajectories. In (C), the number of thresholds potentially passed in the coming decades (depending on warming trajectory) is shown per decade (bars) and cumulatively (lines).

(https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abn7950) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has begun talking about the possible failure of civil society in response to increasing extreme events. We are seeing early indicators of this in Australia, with people living in tents for years after floods made worse by climate change. They face decisions about whether or not to rebuild on that land.How long will there be money available to provide disaster relief in Australia and around the world? Where will hundreds of millions of people go after being displaced by extreme wet bulb temperature, crop failure, fire, flooding and sea level rise?How did we get here?Arriving at this juncture in human history feels like a massive failure. A failure of leadership, of decision making, of information dissemination through media, and perhaps our priorities, has left us in this extremely challenging position.Many factors have conspired against us. These include fossil fuel companies funding misinformation and climate-related \"green washing\"\u2014exaggerating or misrepresenting their climate credentials. Elected leaders being influenced by donations from the fossil fuel industry. Earlier low-resolution climate models failing to capture local scale processes, and therefore underestimating climate system sensitivity. Poor media communication of the urgency of the issue. And throw in some good old human \"optimism bias\" towards positive outcomes.As a climate scientist, with almost 18 years experience in operations at the Bureau of Meteorology and more recently, in my work on high resolution climate projections for state government, I deeply know the climate grief so eloquently communicated by climate researcher Joelle Gergis.In response, I have had to draw on tools such as meditation and mindfulness to deal with the awareness the science presents including the likely future suffering of so many. It is challenging to see where we are heading and\u2014with what is at stake\u2014to see life going on as if everything is fine.A turning pointFuture events are going to challenge us in many ways. Humanity faces a choice between retreat into fear and war, or cooperation and collaboration. There is much already happening and a lot we can do, as individuals and communities. We can restore landscapes, reward sustainability, create a circular economy and electrify everything. But we need to act fast.So, as King Charles III's coronation plays across our TV screens and media feeds in coming days, keep the incredibly urgent climate crisis in mind. Ask our leaders to step up. Do not be distracted, as future generations will judge us for the choices we make today.

  "text": "Being an environmentally friendly tourist can be challenging. Tourism is an industry that brings many negative environmental impacts\u2014our pleasure often comes at the expense of local habitats or wildlife.          Maya Bay on Thailand's uninhabited Phi Phi Leh island became famous as the location of the 2000 Hollywood movie \"The Beach.\" But this led to rapid growth in visitors to the bay\u2014as many as 8,000 a day at its peak\u2014and put enormous strain on the bay's natural habitats.In 2018, the bay was closed to tourists for four years to let its coral reefs and wildlife recover.But tourism can also be an inspiring way to connect with oneself, with others and with new places. As tourists, we can learn, share and contribute to positive environmental practices.As a tourist, you also have influence. The money you spend, the social interactions you have and the resources you consume all help to shape an area.So here are four pieces of advice for making your next holiday better for the environment.Spend locallyWe've all heard variations on the mantra \"take only memories, leave only footprints.\" This message of less consumption and lower impact is a good ethos for environmentally sensitive tourism. The first thing to do is think about how you can leave more positive footprints behind.An excellent way to make the most of your economic footprint is to stay and shop in independent businesses. These businesses tend to pay local taxes and are owned by and employ local people. More of the money you spend stays in the immediate area as a result.Where tourist money directly benefits local people and businesses, their support for conservation is often encouraged. Tourists visiting rhino sanctuaries in Botswana, for example, bring income and support jobs. In 2010, the country's Khama Rhino Sanctuary employed 26 permanent staff and many more casual laborers.This economic security can, in turn, prompt local people to appreciate the importance of protecting vulnerable animal species like rhinos. Separate research on people living around Kenya's Maasai Mara nature reserve found that people whose livelihoods were dependent on tourism were more likely to support efforts to conserve local wildlife.      Tread lightlyTourism creates waste and uses up resources. Treading carefully will minimize the environmental impact you have on your holiday destination.A simple way to lower your environmental footprint is to use fewer resources at every stage of your holiday. A single tourist uses 300 liters of water in their holiday accommodation on average each night. Reusing towels, flushing the toilet less and shortening your shower time can all help to reduce demand for water resources.Thinking about the footprints you leave as a tourist is a useful mindset. You may even become more aware of the positive legacy you can leave behind.Learn about the local area and the environmental issues that matter there. If habitat loss is a problem, contribute to local organizations that support conservation. Organizations like the National Trust even offer holidays in the UK that help to fund their work.Place mattersTourism shifts you away from the familiar and gives you space for self-reflection. Research has found that people have been inspired by travel to make life changes such as relocating or shifting career.Many keen rock climbers, for instance, adopt a minimalist and mobile lifestyle. One study on climbers' lifestyles in the US showed that the challenges of life on the road, gatherings at campgrounds and the considerable amount of time spent in nature can be enriching.Rock climbers' lifestyles are inspired by and connected to natural settings. And many alternative types of tourism are too. These tourists can become powerful advocates for the protection of the places they care deeply about. Surf tourists, for example, have driven various campaigns against the discharge of sewage into UK bathing waters.You and those you travel with can be similar cheerleaders for the places you care about. Join organizations fighting for their conservation, contribute to their sustainable development and share your appreciation of these places with others.Stay curiousA final thing you can do as a tourist is to keep exploring. It can be tempting to stay in a tourist bubble and not leave the confines of your resort or stick with familiar travel groups and activities.Cruises are a classic example of bubble tourism. The places visited do not really matter; the floating hotel is the main attraction.But cruise tourism rarely benefits local populations and brings significant negative environmental impacts. In the Trujillo Bay area of Honduras, for example, increases in garbage and sewage have been reported since commercial cruise tourism began operating in the area in 2014.Similar concerns have prompted calls to restrict cruise tourism in popular European destinations like Venice, Marseille and Barcelona. In 2022, more than 50,000 people signed a petition to ban cruise ships from Marseille.Going beyond familiar or fashionable tourist bubbles can help you avoid such negative associations. Short-haul city breaks are a more environmentally friendly option.Travelers to these destinations are more likely to use means of transportation that are associated with less CO\u2082 emissions than long-haul travel, such as trains or coaches. And in urban areas, their activities are likely to take place in a concentrated geographical area.Thinking about the footprints you leave and the memories you take can help you to become a more environmentally aware tourist. Leave positive imprints behind, tread carefully, put yourself out there and keep exploring.This is a mantra to adopt and share with your travel groups to get the most out of your holiday experiences while simultaneously reducing your impact on the planet.

  "text": "The extreme heat that engulfed the Iberian peninsula and parts of North Africa last week would have been \"almost impossible without climate change\", an international scientific study found on Friday.          The \"exceptional early heatwave\" involved \"local temperatures up to 20 degrees hotter than normal and April records being broken by up to 6 degrees\", said the report by the World Weather Attribution (WWA), whose scientists study the link between extreme weather events and climate change.A mass of hot, dry air from North Africa reached the Iberian peninsula early last week, driving temperatures to record highs for April, with the mercury hitting 38.8 degrees Celsius (101.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in southern Spain and 36.9C in central Portugal.Such temperatures only tend to occur in July.In Morocco, local records were broken with temperatures soaring above 41C in some places, while in Algeria, they exceeded 40C.Spain this year recorded its driest and hottest April since at least 1961, when such records began, national weather agency AEMET said.\"Human-caused climate change made the record-breaking heatwave in Spain, Portugal, Morocco and Algeria at least 100 times more likely and the heat would have been almost impossible without climate change,\" the WWA report found.It caused \"temperatures up to 3.5 degrees C hotter than they would have been without climate change\", provoking an event they described as \"rare\".More frequent, more intense\"We will see more frequent and more intense heatwaves in the future as global warming continues,\" Sjoukje Philip, a researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, said at the report's launch.Such abnormally high temperatures followed \"a historical multi-year drought in those regions, exacerbating the impacts of the heat on agriculture which is already threatened by an increasing water scarcity,\" the WWA said.In Spain, which is known as Europe's vegetable garden, the main farmers' union, COAG, has warned that 60 percent of agricultural land is currently \"suffocating\" from the lack of rainfall.With water reservoirs at half their capacity, Spain has asked Brussels to help by activating the European Union's agriculture crisis reserve funds.Experts say parts of Spain are the driest in a thousand years, with the ongoing drought prompting some farmers to choose not to sow crops this year.\"The Mediterranean is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change in Europe,\" said Friederike Otto, a senior climate science expert at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at London's Imperial College.\"The region is already experiencing a very intense and long-lasting drought and these high temperatures at a time of the year when it should be raining is worsening the situation.\"Spain forecasters under attackAfter experiencing its hottest year on record in 2022 and the extreme April heatwave, Spain's government was on Friday forced to come to the defence of AEMET, whose forecasts have been met with a barrage of threats and abuse from climate conspiracy theorists.\"Murderers\", \"Criminals\", \"You'll pay for this\" and \"We're watching you\" were just some of the anonymous messages sent to AEMET in recent weeks on social media, by email and even by phone.\"Enough is enough,\" wrote Ecology Minister Teresa Ribera on social media.\"Lying, fuelling conspiracies and fear, being insulting... impoverishes us as a society and has unacceptable consequences,\" she said.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:April heat in western Med 'almost impossible without climate change' (2023, May 5)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-april-western-med-impossible-climate.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_race": " Critical.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the ancient, sacred town in the Himalayas?",
  "answer_squad": " Joshimath",
  "text": "In northern India, a tragedy is playing out in slow-motion. Located at about 2,000 meters elevation in Chamoli District in the Himalayas, Joshimath is an ancient, sacred town of about 17,000 people. Popular with pilgrims and visitors wanting to ski or climb the nearby mountains, the town is a beautiful refuge from the bustle of the plains.          Late in 2022, a new chapter started in the long history of Joshimath as cracks started to develop in buildings across the town. These quickly spread over a large area, ripping apart roads, houses and hotels. These events were widely reported by the Indian media, which generally ascribed them to \"subsidence.\" The reality is something else: the town is built upon debris from an ancient landslide.And that landslide has started to move.The age of the landslide is unclear, but it is likely to be hundreds or even thousands of years old. The debris has been covered with soil and plants, hiding it from sight and giving local people the impression they were living on solid ground.The existence of the landslide, and the hazard that it poses, was identified about 50 years ago, but little action has been taken to mitigate the risk. To date at least 860 houses have been rendered uninhabitable, and the landslide continues to move. Hundreds of people are living in temporary camps, with no real clarity as to their future prospects, and thousands more worry that the landslide movement will spread to their part of the town.Why the landslide started moving again in late 2022 is unclear. In the past few months many fingers have been pointed. Over the past decade, a large hydroelectric \"run of the river\" scheme has been built in the valleys near the town, which meant building tunnels beneath Joshimath. Shaking caused by blasting has been reported throughout the area. It is unsurprising that people believe that there is a link.In early 2021, a large debris flow swept down the valley below Joshimath, triggered by the collapse of a mountainside high in the mountains, severely damaging the dam from the hydroelectric power scheme and killing more than 200 people, mostly dam workers. Some people link the reactivation of the Joshimath landslide to this flow.A third theory is that climate change, which has caused more intense rainfall in the area, has triggered the landslide. All of these mechanisms are possible. In the absence of detailed scientific investigations, rumors dominate.      Many other Joshimaths go unreportedSadly, Joshimath is not an isolated case. Landslides are destroying communities right across the high mountains of South Asia, most frequently small, isolated settlements that do not command the attention that has been heaped on Joshimath. Over and again, people lose their major economic assets\u2014their house and land\u2014and are rendered destitute. Women and girls often fare particularly poorly in these circumstances.In the vast majority of cases, the landslides result from things outside of the control of the people affected, making these events a travesty of social justice. At the macro-level, the increases in rainfall intensity that are occurring in many mountain areas result principally from greenhouse gas emissions that occurred thousands of kilometers away in far richer economies.In other cases, the landslides are the result of large energy projects that will bring security of supply to distant cities, while isolated communities may still have no reliable supply, and that will generate profits that will bring little benefit to the mountain regions. More locally, landslides often result from roads that serve to bypass their communities, and are sometimes associated with local corruption as, for example, the owners of construction machinery bribe officials to allow road building in unsuitable areas.A safety net for landslide victimsThere is a paucity of social justice, or even of discussion about social justice, when it comes to these landslides. The victims at every stage are the local people, who lose their home, their land, their possessions and their livelihood, and sometimes their lives. Even in richer countries landslides are often not an insurable risk, in contrast to floods or windstorms. For most people it is not possible to assess the likelihood of a property being affected by a landslide, so home owners are in effect having to gamble.It is time to make changes. In the mountains of South Asia, the current rampant, poorly-coordinated development needs to be controlled for the sake of the environment and the local population. There is no case for an embargo on construction across the region, but there is a strong rationale for ensuring that there are proper technical assessments of large schemes; for environmental impact assessments that are scientifically rigorous; for land use planning controls on the basis of hazard and for the careful management of water. When things go wrong, and they will, there is a need for a safety net, either through insurance or through government schemes.Sadly, failure to act will further drive inequality, causing a further breakdown in the fragile social balance of high mountain areas.

  "answer_squad": " 200-liter",
  "text": "The need for a smaller, more transportable version of ANSTO's 1,500-liter atmospheric radon-222 monitor, and with a calibration traceable to the International System of Units, prompted the team to develop a 200-liter radon monitor that would meet those needs.          This world-leading dual-flow-loop two-filter ANSTO technology is used in more than 30 locations around the world, but demand is growing as the need for a better understanding of the processes that drive urban air pollution and climate becomes more important.Recognized by the World Meteorological Organization as the best in the world for global and atmospheric compositional baseline studies, it is used by the International Atomic Energy Agency and leading environmental monitoring organizations around the world.The ANSTO-designed radon monitors, that are made and serviced by environmental scientists, provide invaluable data on atmospheric mixing to support accurate monitoring of changing atmospheric conditions.\"Several years ago, we learned that a competitor had built a product that wasn't as sensitive, but it was more portable and that spurred us to see if we could reduce the size,\" explained environmental Atmospheric Physicist / Senior Researcher Dr. Scott Chambers.\"With some funding support from the National Metrology Institute in Germany, who were interested in purchasing one of the new detectors as part of an international Trace Radon Project, we went ahead,\" said Dr. Chambers.Using the same detection method but with a vertically oriented design, they were able to reduce the size from 3.0 meters by 1.7 meters by 0.9 m (4.6 m3) to 1.6 meters by 48 centimeters by 48 centimeters (0.37 m3).The critical change was the volume of the main measurement chamber from 1,500 liters to 200 liters while retaining the capacity to reliably measure radon activity down to 0.14 Becquerels per cubic meter.                A relative size comparison of the 1500 L, 700 L, and 200 L model radon detectors. Credit: Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO)             \"There are essentially fewer alpha particles and decay products to count in the smaller volume of air, but the results are still very good for most purposes,\" says Dr. Chambers.\"We are trying to improve the sensitivity with some modifications to the measurement head.      \"The new size will be ideally suited to buildings, where environmental authorities are monitoring radon concentrations, as they can be harmful. It is important to have baseline data to make assessments. Our new detector is more manageable, breaking into two parts to fit in a normal vehicle, with a total weight less than 80 kilograms.\"It will also be possible to calibrate these instruments in the field much more accurately than the larger models.The technology is useful in places where even relatively low radioactivity levels need to be monitored quickly and accurately, such as for urban pollution studies, in buildings and underground science facilities, such as the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory.Emissions of naturally occurring radon from the ground are more threatening in the Northern Hemisphere, where building insulation tends to trap the gas.Some extremely high levels have been recorded in the U.K.The instrument, which is made from marine-grade stainless-steel, has a service life of over ten years. Apart from some cursory pressure checks, it can operate independently and relatively free of maintenance for years at a time.                A schematic of the new portable 200 L Radon Monitor.\u00a0 Credit: Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO)             Compared to other scientific instruments, that is very minimal.Detectors are currently assembled by ANSTO technician Mr. Ot Sisoutham but ANSTO is negotiating for them to be built externally to keep up with demand.Background atmospheric data captured by radon detectors in isolated, strategic locations is referred to as baseline because it is unaffected by local pollution sources and represents the world's most pristine air.The highly precise atmospheric data improves an understanding of climate impacts and anticipate future effects.\"We are proud of this innovation that was undertaken entirely by ANSTO scientists and technicians, that is supported with our expertise in radon analysis,\" said Dr. Alistair Williams, research leader, Atmospheric Research Group.\"The only thing it is missing is a name for marketing purposes, but as scientists we don't always think about those things,\" he added.Environmental monitoring of radon is one of ANSTO's many activities to monitor contaminants that move through the atmosphere and affect the people, animals, and plants all around us.\"The new portable monitor is the first research grade radon detector in the world to have been traceably calibrated to the SI system,\" says Chambers. \"Radon monitoring is also useful in looking at greenhouse gas emissions. Because we can estimate the flux of radon reasonably well, the emission of greenhouse gases from the same region is proportional to the ratio of the radon and greenhouse gas concentrations. This provides a convenient 'top-down' method of estimating regional emissions of greenhouse gases to crosscheck 'bottom-up' emission estimates based on reported inventories.\" Provided byAustralian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO)Citation:One of the world's best radon detectors just got smaller (2023, May 5)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-world-radon-detectors-smaller.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_race": " Air quality changes with EVs",
  "question_squad": " What is the third factor that causes poor neighborhoods to not have better air quality?",
  "answer_squad": " higher cost of EVs",
  "text": "A trio of environmental scientists and city planners from the University of California, Berkeley, the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and the University of Miami has found that as motorists slowly make the jump from gasoline-powered vehicles (GVs) to electric-powered vehicles (EVs), people living in the same general area experience different levels of change in air quality. The researchers found air quality tends to improve in higher-income neighborhoods and remains the same or grows worse in poor neighborhoods.       In their study, reported in PLOS Climate, Jaye Mej\u0131\u00b4a-Duwan, Miyuki Hino and Katharine Mach examined the impact of introducing EVs in California and resulting changes in air quality.To learn more about the true impact of the switch to EVs from GVs, the researchers obtained and studied environmental data gathered as part of a government EV rebate program over the years 2010 to 2021. They found that as EV sales rose, air quality in higher-income neighborhoods tended to improve as expected, but the same could not be said for poor neighborhoods, where conditions did not change much or became worse.The researchers found three major factors with regard to this disparity. The first was non-engine produced pollutant emissions. Vehicles traveling on highways, which tend to be closer to poor neighborhoods, produce other pollutants due to road and tire wear. Tire tread particles and brake pad particles become airborne. And in many places, speeding cars continuously whip dust, dirt and other particles near the road surface into the air.The second reason air quality does not improve in poor neighborhoods is that air pollution from power plants increases as demand increases to charge all the new EVs on the road. And power plants tend to be located closer to poor neighborhoods. The third factor is the higher cost of EVs. People in poor neighborhoods quite often cannot afford to buy them; thus, EVs are less likely to be driven there.

  "text": "An international team led by researchers from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has detected aerosols from the Hunga Tonga eruption in the Northern Hemisphere stratospheric westerlies for the first time.          This discovery, published in Science Bulletin, will aid in simulating the physical and chemical processes in volcanic plumes.The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano, located in the South Pacific Ocean, erupted in January 2022, spewing ash and gas into the atmosphere. The eruption was one of the largest in recent years and was closely monitored by scientists worldwide.The purpose of the Sounding Water vapor, Ozone, and Particle (SWOP) campaign is to better understand the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of atmospheric compositions over the Tibetan Plateau. Capturing the volcanic aerosols from the Hunga Tonga eruption was unexpected, according to Prof. Bian Jianchun, an IAP scientist and a team leader of the SWOP campaign.\"We happen to have captured the volcanic aerosols from the Hunga Tonga eruption 12 weeks after it erupted. To my knowledge, this is the first time that it's been detected at the stratospheric westerlies in the Northern Hemisphere,\" said Prof. Bian.Large uncertainties still remain in understanding physical properties and evolutionary process of volcanic aerosols in the stratosphere, particularly SO2 oxidation in volcanic plumes and clouds and the interaction between ash and sulfate aerosols after volcanic eruptions. In-situ measurements obtained in volcanic plumes, especially measurements of the microphysical parameters of volcanic aerosols, provide compelling evidence that reduces these uncertainties. However, it is difficult to obtain these parameters, especially during the occurrence of volcanic eruptions.During the SWOP campaign carried out over the Tibetan Plateau, a balloon-borne payload consisting of the Compact Optical Backscatter Aerosol Detector (COBALD) and the Portable Optical Particle Spectrometer (POPS) was released in Lijiang, Yunan province on April 9, 2022. Unexpectedly, the balloon captured the size spectrum of volcanic aerosols at 24\u201325 km.The Hunga Tonga volcanic aerosol was identified by the size distribution of the aerosol diameter, which was centered at approximately 0.42\u20131.27 \u03bcm, larger than the background mode (0.22\u20130.42 \u03bcm) of stratospheric aerosols, and particle number densities of approximately 1 cm-3. The backscatter ratios derived from the COBALD measurements at 455 nm and 940 nm both showed enhanced aerosol signals between 24 and 25 km. Additionally, measurements showed that the aerosol and water vapor layers were separated in the Hunga Tonga plume.These findings suggest that volcanic eruptions have potential impact on regional and global atmospheric circulation and climate, even thousands of kilometers away from the source. The possible mechanisms that led to the separation of aerosol and water vapor layers in the Hunga Tonga plume will be examined in future study.

  "answer_squad": " Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Research",
  "text": "Researchers have used data from previous publications aiming to answer the question of why the Arctic sea ice is responding much more quickly and obviously to climate change than the Antarctic sea ice, which has stayed relatively stable according to the long-term studies monitoring the Antarctic region's sea ice patterns. Their results were published in the journal Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Research.          \"The differences in responses are explained in terms of geographic, climatic and meteorological differences between the two regions. Arctic sea ice is located in the polar area and encircled by land, while sea ice in the Antarctic is located far from the polar area outside the Antarctic circle,\" said Mohammed Shokr, first author of the paper.The Antarctic sea ice is still being impacted in the form of calving (formation of icebergs by splitting of glaciers) and the melting of ice shelves, just not as quickly as it appears the Arctic sea ice is melting and thinning in an annual cycle. Naturally, this leads to more discussion surrounding the relevant melting in the Arctic, where its impacts are more immediately noticeable due to the population density in the Northern Hemisphere.\"It is expected that Arctic sea ice will mimic the seasonal behavior of the Antarctic sea ice, namely forming in winter and almost completely vanishing in summer,\" said Yufang Ye, author and researcher at Sun Yat-sen University.The seasonal melting of Arctic sea ice and Antarctic ice shelves can vary with atmospheric and oceanic conditions, both of which can lead to less desirable effects on transportation, economies, and the weather. Both regions have melting incidences, but they're occurring for different reasons. This would suggest each problem has the potential for its own answer, and that the two should not necessarily be looked at through the same lens.The authors suggest an alternate question to the popularly posed inquiry of why the Arctic sea ice is more responsive to climate change than Antarctic sea ice: how did the Arctic ice patterns come to mimic the Antarctic's through the impact of global warming?To gain a comprehensive understanding of how sea ice behaves in response to climate change in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions, continuous monitoring is essential. Given the unique quirks and peculiarities of each region, it is crucial to investigate them separately to better answer to the question of how global warming has triggered the shift in Arctic sea ice patterns. Addressing these region-specific questions may lead to further research and insights on the impacts of climate change on sea ice.

  "text": "Her grandfather defended native lands in the Brazilian Amazon with bows and arrows. Today, the weapon of choice for Txai Surui and many young Indigenous activists like her is technology.          The 26-year-old Brazilian is one of the stars of Web Summit Rio, the world's biggest annual technology conference, which was held for the first time outside Europe this week, gathering more than 20,000 entrepreneurs and investors in Brazil.\"Today, technology is like a weapon for us... We use technology and ancestral knowledge as a form of resistance, to protect our land\" against illegal logging and mining, Txai told AFP on the sidelines of the conference in Rio de Janeiro.Using video cameras, drones, GPS, cell phones and social networks, a group of young people from her community monitors land invasions, using an application to report them, says Txai, who stands out in the high-tech conference venue with her feather headdress and traditional face paint.\"But technology can also be used for evil,\" adds the young activist, the coordinator of the Kaninde Ethno-Environmental Defense Association, which represents 21 Amazon Indigenous peoples.\"The same satellites we use to protect our territory are used by land invaders to destroy it. There are people who use Facebook to sell protected Indigenous lands.\"Brazil is home to around 800,000 Indigenous people, according to the latest census.Numerous studies have found that protecting their lands\u201413.75 percent of the country's territory\u2014is one of the best ways to defend forests like the Amazon, a key resource in the race to curb climate change.Family of activistsTxai is following in the footsteps of her parents, both activists who received death threats for fighting illegal logging.                Txai Surui's grandfather defended the rainforest with bows and arrows; she is part of a new generation of Indigenous activists doing it with technology, she says.             Her mother, the environmentalist and Indigenous expert Ivaneide Bandeira, has spent decades fighting to protect native lands.She played a central role in the documentary \"The Territory\"\u2014produced by Txai, and released by National Geographic last year\u2014which follows the Uru-eu-wau-wau people's fight to protect their land in the northern state of Rondonia.Txai's father, the Indigenous chief Almir Surui, was the first to use technology to defend the forest, she says, in 2007, he visited Google headquarters in California and convinced the US tech giant to help his people create the \"Surui Cultural Map,\" an interactive experience on Google Earth.Almir, whom Txai calls a \"visionary,\" was also the first to organize an Indigenous group to sell credits on the carbon market.Barefoot in the conference hall, Txai urges the international technology jet set to visit the rainforest.\"We need people who work with technology to reconnect with nature,\" says the activist, who is studying for a law degree.\"When they tell me they want to help me with new apps, I tell them: 'Come get to know us, and see what we need.'\"      Lingering 'prejudice'Txai, who also attended the UN climate talks in Glasgow in 2021, said she regrets being the only Indigenous representative at Web Summit Rio.\"There's still a lot of prejudice, a lot of racism,\" she said.                Txai is following in her family's footsteps: her parents were both activists who received death threats for fighting illegal logging.             But there are signs of change.Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who took office in January, has vowed to make protecting the Amazon a priority. Last week, the veteran leftist created Brazil's first protected Indigenous reservations in five years.His predecessor, far-right ex-army captain Jair Bolsonaro, made good on his vow not to allow \"one more centimeter\" of reservation land during his presidency.Under Bolsonaro (2019-2022), average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon surged by more than 75 percent from the previous decade.\"A lot has changed\" under the new administration, Txai said. \"But we know we still have a long road ahead.\"\"My role is to pressure, to demand results. There are still a lot of Indigenous lands to protect.\"The biggest obstacle is Brazil's current Congress, which is \"very conservative, even more than during the (Bolsonaro) administration,\" she said.At the global scale, she urged people to think of climate change in more than just economic terms.\"We're almost at the point of no return,\" she said.\"We have to stop just thinking about the economy and think about people.\"    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Indigenous youths use tech as 'weapon' to protect Amazon (2023, May 5)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-indigenous-youths-tech-weapon-amazon.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Special permission is required to clear forest in Switzerland. Until now, the system has worked well. However, plans to increase wind and solar electricity generation could increase conflicts.          Around 185 hectares of forest\u2014equivalent to 260 football pitches\u2014are cleared in Switzerland each year. This is not due to felling or storm damage, but to create space for roads, mobile phone masts, drinking water catchment installations, gravel pits and other infrastructure. And even more forest is expected to be sacrificed as renewable energy sources such as wind and solar farms continue to grow, even though it is in principle necessary to compensate for lost woodland.In Switzerland, forest land may not be cleared for infrastructure without a permit, and meticulous records are kept. \"Every single project from the last 120 years has been recorded,\" explains agricultural economist David Troxler. \"This data collection is unique in the world and has barely been used for research up to now.\" Until now, research into forest clearance has focused primarily on the tropics and developing countries.As part of the National Research Programme \"Sustainable Economy\" (NRP 73), the ETH Ph.D. student has analyzed the digitalized data sets for 2001 to 2017, which comprised over 6,000 projects. He combed the data for links between the reasons for forest clearances and factors such as landscape and population density. His aim was to gain a better understanding of the driving forces and highlight solutions to potential conflicts.By and large, the Swiss forestry protection system is currently working well, Troxler says. For example, forest clearance is not more common in intensively farmed areas than anywhere else.\"It's not like the tropics, where forests with good access are sacrificed to make space for new crops.\" Furthermore, he found no evidence of particularly heavy forest clearances for new ski lifts or similar infrastructure in Alpine tourist areas. He interprets the lack of such typical patterns as a sign that the control mechanisms are working. In the Alps, there is even an increase in forestation as a growing number of alpine meadows are being returned to nature.      Virtually no space in the MittellandLosses in terms of existing forest area were greatest in the Mittelland (Swiss Plateau), with temporary or permanent clearance affecting around 0.5 percent of forested areas between 2001 and 2017. This reflects the fact that conflicting demands are most pronounced in this heavily populated area.\"It's a region where forests are exposed to a particularly high number of converging needs,\" Troxler explains. While local populations see the forests as an important recreational space and precious ecosystem, people also want more living space and good transport links. The Mittelland is also an attractive region for commercial forestry since it is flat and served by a good transport network.It is therefore increasingly difficult to find space for the reforestation required by law to compensate for clearances. Farmers are unwilling to give up a single square meter of ever-dwindling farmland, and no one wants to rezone building land as a non-building zone.\"Since it is increasingly difficult to find reforestation space, it will become increasingly necessary to make use of the exemption rules that already exist,\" Troxler explains. Among other things, these provide for an ecological upgrading of existing forest instead of planting new forest. Troxler is currently ascertaining how often these exemptions are applied.As regards the immediate future, Troxler expects conflicting demands to increase. This is because the expansion of renewable energy sources will also come at the cost of forested land, particularly in the Alps and Mittelland, even though the wide range of projects makes it difficult to quantify how much space will be needed.Space will not only have to be created for the wind turbines and solar panels themselves, but also for the associated high-voltage lines, construction site access roads and dams. \"And this infrastructure forms part of a sustainable economy that is actually socially desirable.\" This dichotomy is already apparent in legal rulings. Since 2017, forest conservation has no longer had a higher legal status than the construction of infrastructure for renewable energy.To minimize conflicts going forward, Troxler advises proactive planning on the part of the authorities to secure space for like-for-like reforestation at an early stage\u2014for example by creating interregional land pools. \"The cantons should already have ideas up their sleeve to prevent forest conservation requirements being further eroded.\"The findings are published in the journal Forest Policy and Economics.

  "text": "Geoscientists have detected specific gases being released from fractured rocks in real time after a series of small chemical explosions set underground.          This fundamental research, led by Sandia geoscientist Steve Bauer, could one day improve the prediction of earthquakes or detection of underground explosions.\"In the different shots, we were able to measure different relative amounts of noble gases, which we hope is consistent with the amount of deformation caused by the explosion,\" said Steve, who recently retired.\"The chemical explosions had the same amount of TNT equivalent, but produced different amounts of liquids and gases, so they deformed the rock to different extents. My pie-in-the-sky goal is to measure the amount of noble gas at a location after an explosion or earthquake and then be able to understand the amount of strain the rock has experienced.\"Fundamentals of noble gases and lab testsInert noble gases, including helium, neon and argon, naturally form underground as radioactive elements in rock decay into lighter, more stable elements. These gases become trapped in the structure of nearby rock and some of it can be released when the rock is cracked, whether by a natural earthquake or a human-caused underground explosion, Steve said.\"The release of noble gases had been observed in the field in relation to earthquake activity, so we thought we would have a good chance of making these measurements in the field,\" Steve said.But before Steve and his colleagues Scott Broome, a Sandia geoscientist, and Payton Gardner, a geosciences professor at University of Montana, conducted their experiments in the field, they deformed, or crushed, a two-inch-diameter cylinder of rock along three axes\u2014the top-bottom, left-right and front-back\u2014inside a sealed container.\"In the lab we learned that when we stress or strain different types of rock to a certain point, it begins to fracture, and at the time the rock fractures, it releases noble gases that we can sense with mass spectrometry,\" Steve said. \"We can sense the gas coming out when the rock is fractured internally. We've done this experiment with numerous types of rock: tuff, salt, granite, other igneous and sedimentary rocks. We were probably the first to make the gas measurements in real time as the rock was being deformed.\"Mass spectrometry is a powerful method for measuring ions to either determine what an unknown material is made up of, or as in this case, to precisely determine the ratios of different elements in a sample. The team used a quadrupole mass spectrometer for these tests.Then they moved on to in-field experiments, using the same powerful method to detect noble gases.      Moving to field testsThe team was involved in a collaboration where three underground explosions were conducted at the Energetic Materials Research and Testing Center outside of Socorro, New Mexico, in the Blue Canyon Dome made of rhyolite rock.Each of the test explosions used a different explosive compound but the same basic setup. The explosion was set off down a well less than a foot across at a depth of 130-200 feet. Arrayed 15-23 feet away around this central hole were eight other monitoring wells that went down about 200 feet.Steve's team monitored the naturally formed noble gases and trace gases after the chemical explosions in these wells while other teams from Sandia and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory looked at large-scale changes in the permeability of the rock, the release of radon, as well as traditional and emerging seismological measurements.\"Conducting these experiments in the field is technically challenging,\" Scott said. \"To measure these gases, you need equipment that is very sensitive to pressure fluctuations and inherently, when you explode rock underground, it creates large pressure fluctuations. You need to protect the mass spectrometer from the initial shock of the experiment. We have seen noble gas released from these tests, and we have also not seen it. We've been able to publish on both of these observations. This is pretty fundamental research.\"The first explosion didn't release any noble gases that could be recorded, which led the team to infer that the explosion caused shifts in existing fractures underground, rather than creating new fractures, Scott said. They published their results and conclusions from this first test in 2021 in the journal Geofluids.\"In the two additional explosions we got much better data; we were able to document the release of noble gases as a function of time after the explosions,\" Steve said. \"After the explosion, it takes a certain amount of time for the gases to travel through the damaged rock to get to our detection array.\"They plan to continue their work with another set of experiments in the field, in a different type of rock, called tuff. For this set, they will not measure the gases in real time, but instead collect samples from different locations and at different times after the explosions for later analysis.In addition to monitoring earthquakes and underground explosions, improved understanding of how and why rocks fracture could also be valuable for enhanced geothermal systems and strain detection in unconventional oil and gas production.

  "text": "The bushfire outlook for many parts of Australia has changed drastically over the past decade. Environmental conditions have transformed, producing larger and more destructive bushfires.          The frequency of bushfires that alter the atmospheric conditions around them has also increased. Nowhere was this more evident than during the Black Summer bushfires of 2019\u20132020.As we continue to experience the effects of climate change, these environmental changes and destructive fire events will only become more prevalent.Thanks to satellite imaging data collected over the past 20 years, we can map and quantify the region-by-region impact of climate change and how this has affected the prevalence of fire in different parts of Australia. With more accurate bushfire modeling, we can assist fire services and land managers to determine where they need to refocus their efforts as we adjust to the long haul of adaptation to climate change.To this end, the maps in this article show where fires occurred in two consecutive decades, and show the changes between them. They also show regions where those changes exceed a threshold, indicating a significant increase in fire activity. This enables better-targeted fire risk management.Two decades of satellite fire monitoringMore than 20 years ago NASA launched two satellites, (Terra in 1999 and on Aqua in 2002), to monitor the Earth's surface with specialized sensors. One sensor, MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), was able to see both smoke plumes and the infrared signature of fires. An algorithm was developed to classify image pixels containing fire, producing a set of \"hotspots\".                The ratio of hotspots in 2019-20 to the first decade average for zones around Australia. Credit: Rick McRae             Both satellites have lasted well beyond their planned mission durations. This is significant for fire managers, who now have two decades of continuous hotspot data.Mapping Australia's fire hotspotsFor many years I have been analyzing MODIS data from the perspective of seasonality. I have been looking at when fires occurred and whether that reflected expectations. The aim is to validate seasonal bushfire outlooks.The past 20 years of annual seasonality reviews are now available online. Each year the previous 12 months' data were compared against those from a set time range or control period. This was a decade-long period covering a mix of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a years, indicating \"average\" conditions.Recently, we passed the end of the second decade of MODIS data. This opened the prospect of comparing two decades (starting in July 2002 and in July 2012) and looking for differences.In a year with a lot of fire, Australia creates more than 450,000 hotspots. This makes the 20 years of MODIS data an irreplaceable tool for seamless, quantitative assessments of fire dynamics across Australia. The datasets are freely available online and have been used to create useful products to assist fire managers.Several caveats apply to hotspot datasets. Low-intensity fires (especially well-planned, hazard-reduction burns), fires under heavy cloud cover, and fire runs that burn out quickly may not produce a hotspot. The latter was the case for many of the worst fire events during the Black Summer fires.                Hotspot count maps for decade one (left) and decade two (right). Larger symbols indicate higher counts. Credit: Rick McRae             There is also no way to separate wildfire from planned fire. This has to be a goal, as both contribute to the fire regime but the balance varies a lot between regions. Future burn planning may become a major challenge as big wildfire events like Black Summer put much of the landscape into a single fire age. This makes burning difficult until the forest recovers.To determine how fire activity had changed between the first and second decades of data, hotspots were aggregated into grid-cells. Each spanned half a degree of both latitude and longitude.By comparing the number and ratio of hotspots in the grid-cell count from decade one to that from decade two, we could determine where fire frequency was changing the most.Some areas, such as eastern New South Wales, have a very high ratio of change between the first and second decade, reflecting Black Summer. Some areas, such as Arnhem Land, have a very high hotspot count and a slight increase from the first decade to the second, which may produce a significant challenge in future.To encompass the effects of both high counts and high ratios, a threshold was set and any region that exceeded this was an area that needed the most attention.This produced a set of geographic regions with consistent patterns.The impacts detailed in the interactive map below (click on the dots for details) must be considered as longer-term management issues for the highlighted regions.                Hotspot count ratios from decade one to decade two, showing where fire activity has increased and decreased. Credit: Rick McRae             Year-to-year fire patterns have been showing extreme swings in recent years, which may swamp the longer-term trends. However, these trends have picked up many of the key operational challenges, including fire thunderstorms, of recent years.These challenges are evident in forests in the south-east and south-west of Australia, south-east Queensland, central Tasmania and the tropics.      Hotspot mapping in the futureChallenges as we move forward include developing ways to merge the MODIS data with data from the next generation of satellites, and to separate data for wildfire and prescribed burning.This and other work will allow us to better anticipate what the next decade will bring.

  "answer_squad": " photosynthesis",
  "text": "New research led by an Oregon State University scientist begins to unravel the role dust plays in nourishing global ocean ecosystems while helping regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.          Researchers have long known that phytoplankton, which are plantlike organisms that live in the upper part of the ocean and are the foundation of the marine food web, rely on dust from land-based sources for key nutrients. But the extent and magnitude of the impact of the dust, which consists of particles from sources such as soil that are lifted by the wind and impact the Earth's climate, have been difficult to estimate globally.\"This is really the first time it has been shown, using the modern observational record and at the global scale, that the nutrients carried by dust being deposited on the ocean are creating a response in the surface ocean biology,\" said Toby Westberry, an oceanographer at Oregon State and lead author of the paper published in Science on May 4.The ocean plays an important role in the carbon cycle; carbon dioxide from the atmosphere dissolves in surface waters, where phytoplankton turn the carbon into organic matter through photosynthesis. Some of the newly formed organic matter sinks from the surface ocean to the deep sea, where it is locked away, a pathway known as the biological pump.In the new paper, Westberry and other scientists from Oregon State; University of Maryland, Baltimore County; and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center estimate deposition of dust supports 4.5% of the global annual export production, or sink, of carbon. Regional variation in this contribution can be much higher, approaching 20% to 40%, they found.\"That's important because it's a pathway to get carbon out of the atmosphere and down into the deep ocean,\" Westberry said. \"The biological pump is one of the key controls on atmospheric carbon dioxide, which is a dominant factor driving global warming and climate change.\"                Africa dust on June 18, 2020, NASA-NOAA\u2019s Suomi NPP satellite. Credit: NASA Earth Observatory.             In the ocean, vital nutrients for phytoplankton growth are largely provided through the physical movement of those nutrients from deep waters up to the surface, a process known as mixing or upwelling. But some nutrients are also provided through atmospheric dust.      To date, the understanding of the response by natural marine ecosystems to atmospheric inputs has been limited to singularly large events, such as wildfires, volcanic eruptions and extreme dust storms. In fact, previous research by Westberry and others examined ecosystem responses following the 2008 eruption on Kasatochi Island in southwestern Alaska.In the new paper, Westberry and Michael Behrenfeld, an Oregon State professor in the Department of Botany and Plant Pathology, along with scientists from UMBC and NASA built on this past research to look at phytoplankton response worldwide.Westberry and Behrenfeld focused their efforts on using satellite data to examine changes in ocean color following dust inputs. Ocean color imagery is collected across the global ocean every day and reports changes in the abundance of phytoplankton and their overall health. For example, greener water generally corresponds to abundant and healthy phytoplankton populations, while bluer waters represent regions where phytoplankton are scarce and often undernourished.The scientists at UMBC and NASA focused their efforts on modeling dust transport and deposition to the ocean surface.\"Determining how much dust is deposited into the ocean is hard, because much of the deposition occurs during rainstorms when satellites cannot see the dust. That is why we turned to a model,\" said UMBC's Lorraine Remer, research professor at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research Center II, a consortium led by UMBC. The UMBC team used observations to confirm a NASA global model before incorporating its results into the study.                China dust. Credit: NASA Earth Observatory.             Working together, the research team found that the response of phytoplankton to dust deposition varies based on location.In low-latitude ocean regions, the signature of dust input is predominately seen as an improvement in phytoplankton health, but not abundance. In contrast, phytoplankton in higher-latitude waters often show improved health and increased abundance when dust is provided. This contrast reflects differing relationships between phytoplankton and the animals that eat them.Lower latitude environments tend to be more stable, leading to a tight balance between phytoplankton growth and predation. Thus, when dust improves phytoplankton health, or growth rate, this new production is rapidly consumed and almost immediately transferred up the food chain.At higher latitudes, the link between phytoplankton and their predators is weaker because of constantly changing environmental conditions. Accordingly, when dust stimulates phytoplankton growth, the predators are a step behind, and the phytoplankton populations exhibit both improved health and increased abundance.The research team is continuing this research, bringing in improved modeling tools and preparing for more advanced satellite data from NASA's upcoming Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite mission, some of which will be collected by the UMBC-designed and -built HARP2 instrument.\"The current analysis demonstrates measurable ocean biological responses to an enormous dynamic range in atmospheric inputs,\" Westberry said. \"We anticipate that, as the planet continues to warm, this link between the atmosphere and oceans will change.\" More information:T.

  "text": "Continents are part of what makes Earth uniquely habitable for life among the planets of the solar system, yet surprisingly little is understood about what gave rise to these huge pieces of the planet's crust and their special properties.          New research from Elizabeth Cottrell, research geologist and curator of rocks at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, and lead study author Megan Holycross, formerly a Peter Buck Fellow and National Science Foundation Fellow at the museum and now an assistant professor at Cornell University, deepens the understanding of Earth's crust by testing and ultimately eliminating one popular hypothesis about why continental crust is lower in iron and more oxidized compared to oceanic crust. The iron-poor composition of continental crust is a major reason why vast portions of the Earth's surface stand above sea level as dry land, making terrestrial life possible today.The study, published today (May 4) in Science, uses laboratory experiments to show that the iron-depleted, oxidized chemistry typical of Earth's continental crust likely did not come from crystallization of the mineral garnet, as a popular explanation proposed in 2018.The building blocks of new continental crust issue forth from the depths of the Earth at what are known as continental arc volcanoes, which are found at subduction zones where an oceanic plate dives beneath a continental plate. In the garnet explanation for continental crust's iron-depleted and oxidized state, the crystallization of garnet in the magmas beneath these continental arc volcanoes removes non-oxidized (reduced or ferrous, as it is known among scientists) iron from the terrestrial plates, simultaneously depleting the molten magma of iron and leaving it more oxidized.One of the key consequences of Earth's continental crust's low iron content relative to oceanic crust is that it makes the continents less dense and more buoyant, causing the continental plates to sit higher atop the planet's mantle than oceanic plates. This discrepancy in density and buoyancy is a major reason that the continents feature dry land while oceanic crusts are underwater, as well as why continental plates always come out on top when they meet oceanic plates at subduction zones.      The garnet explanation for the iron depletion and oxidation in continental arc magmas was compelling, but Cottrell said one aspect of it did not sit right with her.\"You need high pressures to make garnet stable, and you find this low-iron magma at places where crust isn't that thick and so the pressure isn't super high,\" she said.In 2018, Cottrell and her colleagues set about finding a way to test whether the crystallization of garnet deep beneath these arc volcanoes is indeed essential to the process of creating continental crust as is understood. To accomplish this, Cottrell and Holycross had to find ways to replicate the intense heat and pressure of the Earth's crust in the lab, and then develop techniques sensitive enough to measure not just how much iron was present, but to differentiate whether that iron was oxidized.                Apollo 8 pilot Bill Anders took this iconic photo of Earth from lunar orbit on Christmas Eve, Dec. 24, 1968. Earth\u2019s continents\u2014unique in the solar system\u2014are visible, rising above the ocean. Credit: NASA             To recreate the massive pressure and heat found beneath continental arc volcanoes, the team used what are called piston-cylinder presses in the museum's High-Pressure Laboratory and at Cornell. A hydraulic piston-cylinder press is about the size of a mini fridge and is mostly made of incredibly thick and strong steel and tungsten carbide. Force applied by a large hydraulic ram results in very high pressures on tiny rock samples, about a cubic millimeter in size. The assembly consists of electrical and thermal insulators surrounding the rock sample, as well as a cylindrical furnace. The combination of the piston-cylinder press and heating assembly allows for experiments that can attain the very high pressures and temperatures found under volcanoes.In 13 different experiments, Cottrell and Holycross grew samples of garnet from molten rock inside the piston-cylinder press under pressures and temperatures designed to simulate conditions inside magma chambers deep in Earth's crust. The pressures used in the experiments ranged from 1.5 to 3 gigapascals\u2014that is roughly 15,000 to 30,000 Earth atmospheres of pressure or 8,000 times more pressure than inside a can of soda. Temperatures ranged from 950\u00b0C to 1,230\u00b0C, which is hot enough to melt rock.Next, the team collected garnets from Smithsonian's National Rock Collection and from other researchers around the world. Crucially, this group of garnets had already been analyzed so their concentrations of oxidized and unoxidized iron were known.Finally, the study authors took the materials from their experiments and those gathered from collections to the Advanced Photon Source at the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. There the team used high-energy X-ray beams to conduct X-ray absorption spectroscopy, a technique that can tell scientists about the structure and composition of materials based on how they absorb X-rays. In this case, the researchers were looking into the concentrations of oxidized and unoxidized iron.The samples with known ratios of oxidized and unoxidized iron provided a way to check and calibrate the team's X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements and facilitated a comparison with the materials from their experiments.The results of these tests revealed that the garnets had not incorporated enough unoxidized iron from the rock samples to account for the levels of iron-depletion and oxidation present in the magmas that are the building blocks of Earth's continental crust.\"These results make the garnet crystallization model an extremely unlikely explanation for why magmas from continental arc volcanoes are oxidized and iron depleted,\" Cottrell said. \"It's more likely that conditions in Earth's mantle below continental crust are setting these oxidized conditions.\"Like so many results in science, the findings lead to more questions: \"What is doing the oxidizing or iron depleting?\" Cottrell asked. \"If it's not garnet crystallization in the crust and it's something about how the magmas arrive from the mantle, then what is happening in the mantle? How did their compositions get modified?\"Cottrell said that these questions are hard to answer but that now the leading theory is that oxidized sulfur could be oxidizing the iron, something a current Peter Buck Fellow is investigating under her mentorship at the museum.This study is an example of the kind of research that museum scientists will tackle under the museum's new Our Unique Planet initiative, a public\u2013private partnership, which supports research into some of the most enduring and significant questions about what makes Earth special. Other research will investigate the source of Earth's liquid oceans and how minerals may have served as templates for life.

  "text": "Under the watchful eyes of neighbors, scientists in white lab coats knelt to spread a flour-like mineral over a lawn in Huntington Park.          The dusting of zeolite doesn't take long, but it could be key to mitigating a disaster that has festered for decades across southeast Los Angeles County: lead contamination in the soil around thousands of homes.\"It's 20 minutes of work, and it's a lifetime of lead remediation for a person's backyard,\" said Aaron Celestian, mineral sciences curator with the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and lead scientist with the Prospering Backyards project.Zeolite is naturally adsorbent, meaning it can collect other substances on its surface. The porous mineral, often used in agricultural products, detergents and cat litters, acts like a sponge, trapping lead atoms when it's sprinkled on the contaminated lawns. That stops the lead from seeping back up into the air or breaking away into the soil, rendering it safe for plants, animals and humans, Celestian said.For nearly a century, the now-shuttered Exide Technologies battery recycling plant in Vernon dispersed lead and other toxins across neighborhoods home to predominantly Latino and low-income residents. According to the California Department of Toxic Substances Control, as many as 10,000 properties near the plant could have been affected by the pollution pouring out of Exide.California has requested the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency list the area around the plant as a Superfund site to pay for the cleanup, because Exide abandoned the plant in 2020. The $750-million remediation effort, which began six years ago, is the largest and most expensive environmental cleanup in state history.Though the state toxics agency said it has cleaned thousands of properties, including homes, schools, parks and day-care centers, a Times investigation this year found that numerous properties remediated at great cost to state taxpayers have been left with concentrations of lead in their yards in excess of state health standards.What's more, the cleanup zone recognized by the state extends to a radius of only about 1.7 miles around the former Exide plant, leaving out many properties with concerning levels of lead contamination.      Michelle Jimenez's home in Huntington Park, about 2.5 miles from the plant, is among them.Soil samples taken at her home show lead levels several times higher than what California considers safe, according to Prospering Backyards, which is part of a long-term research project with the Natural History Museum and made up of scientists, artists, activists and community members developing an alternative method to reduce lead exposure in the hardest-hit communities.Growing up in Huntington Park, the 27-year-old Jimenez has been aware of the toxic history behind the Exide plant. Her father, Luis Jimenez, has Parkinson's, anxiety and heart issues she attributes to the neighborhood's exposure to industrial waste. He's lived in Huntington Park since the early 1980s.Children who grew up near the Exide plant have elevated levels of lead in their teeth and blood, according to a 2019 study from the Keck School of Medicine of USC.\"I've known that my community has been exposed to environmental injustices for so long in our soil, water and air,\" Jimenez said. \"I'm so desensitized.\"On a recent April morning, Jimenez and community scientists with Prospering Backyards donned their white lab coats and took soil samples from her frontyard.After they took the samples, the scientists applied the zeolite, which billowed down to the soil in a yellow cloud, and watered the lawn with a hose. Maru Garcia, project lead with Prospering Backyards, placed green flags in the soil where samples were taken.Jimenez's parents watched from the side. They arrived in California in the 1970s from Jalisco, Mexico, and raised five children in the Huntington Park home.After the zeolite was applied, Jimenez's mother, Micaela Jimenez, told her daughter she thought her plants and flowers in the backyard would not have been affected by the lead contamination.Garcia chimed in to tell them about the high amounts of lead concentration in soil samples taken from their frontyard. It's likely there is more lead in the backyard, Garcia said, because toxins from the Exide plant were airborne when they descended on the neighborhood.\"The idea is we want to help more people to become aware of the situation through education, and this is also how to heal our soil,\" Garcia said in Spanish. \"It is not through just information, but through coming to the houses to offer a method that we could develop together to do this remediation.\"The zeolite has been deployed in 15 backyards across multiple neighborhoods in an ongoing experiment that started in December, Garcia said. But research into the project began in 2021, when the Self Help Graphics & Art gallery and community space in Boyle Heights was selected to receive a grant from the Getty Foundation to participate in \"Pacific Standard Time: Art x Science x L.A.\" in 2024.The exhibit, \"Sinks: Places We Call Home,\" will examine the communities around a former petroleum storage facility known as the Athens Tank Farm in Willowbrook as well as the neighborhoods around the Exide plant. The exhibit's title alludes to the idea that these communities have often served as reservoirs or sinks for industrial waste, curators said.\"I'm using this exhibition to elevate this topic of lead contamination,\" said Marvella Muro, director of artistic programs and education at Self Help Graphics.The project is at the intersection of social justice and art, with the voices of the community at the forefront, Muro said. Prospering Backyards invited percussionist Rude Calder\u00f3n to play a djembe drum, because they feel the process is a form of healing for the earth.Muro thinks the project will serve as a reminder that this problem is still unfolding.\"It's about understanding the facts behind the contamination and why the obstacles to cleaning them up are so big. They're so much bigger than one person can handle,\" Muro said.It has taken roughly two years for researchers with Prospering Backyards to train residents on how to become community scientists and take soil samples from yards. There was also a bit of trial and error to determine which type of zeolite would be best to soak up lead atoms, Celestian said.At the Natural History Museum, Celestian pointed to several puck-shaped soil samples taken from yards across Los Angeles County, explaining how each sample is examined to determine how effective the zeolite is at pulling out the lead.Zeolite clinoptilolite, the type of mineral used in the project, is marketed for both human consumption and even for pets and livestock, Celestian said. It's a naturally growing mineral that if digested does not break down at the molecular level and simply passes through the body.\"The hope is that this will be a mode that can be adopted by the county. Even if it isn't the final strategy for lead remediation, it's a way to keep lead out of people's bodies,\" Celestian said.The current process to clean a lawn contaminated with lead is expensive and time-consuming. California has only enough funding to clean about 5,600 properties around the Exide plant, according to a Department of Toxic Substances Control spokesperson. The state has requested federal funding, but the toxics agency still only recognizes the roughly 1.7-mile radius around the former Exide plant as the cleanup zone.The EPA says it is working with the state to collect data to determine if a Superfund status could be considered. The federal agency will begin collecting soil samples in May through August, according to a department spokesperson, and the data will be evaluated later this year.Federal officials visited the site earlier this year and met with local residents, adding that the EPA \"understands and acknowledges the negative impacts Exide operations and the subsequent bankruptcy have had on the surrounding community, which is historically overburdened and underserved, and we'll ensure these impacts are documented during the process of considering a Superfund listing.\"Homes that have been tested by the state have elevated levels, meaning it's unclear where the zone of toxicity ends, said mark! Lopez, a community organizer for East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice. The group has advocated for a more vigorous cleanup and for the state to expand the toxic cleanup zone to a radius of at least 4.5 miles.As an activist, Lopez has been pushing for more accountability from California lawmakers to respond to the Exide cleanup. East Yard Communities is working in a similar vein to Prospering Backyards in educating residents about the lead in the yards.Currently, Lopez is working with the Get the Lead Out research project with Occidental College and the Keck School of Medicine at USC. Project volunteers are meeting with residents, taking soil samples and providing new information to residents who may have not known they were moving into a toxic mess.The project is also teaching people how to reduce their exposure to the toxins in the ground by making sure they wash their hands, leave their shoes outside their homes so they don't track in contaminated soil and recognize all the resources that are available through the county, like blood testing.\"The reality is that the state's not going to come and clean up within the next couple of years,\" Lopez said. \"So it's something that we're having to do on a more community level.\"    2023 Los Angeles Times.

  "text": "With sea surface temperatures swelling to new highs in recent weeks, scientists warn that humanity's carbon pollution has the potential to turn oceans into a global warming \"time bomb\".          Oceans absorb most of the heat caused by planet-warming gases, causing heatwaves that harm aquatic life, altering weather patterns and disrupting crucial planet-regulating systems.While sea surface temperatures normally recede relatively quickly from annual peaks, this year they stayed high, with scientists warning that this underscores an underappreciated but grave impact of climate change.\"The ocean, like a sponge, absorbs more than 90 percent of the increase in heat caused by human activities,\" said leading oceanologist Jean-Baptiste Sallee, of the French research agency CNRS.Year by year ocean warming is increasing at \"an absolutely staggering rate\", he told AFP.In early April, the average surface temperature of the oceans, excluding polar waters, reached 21.1 degrees Celsius, beating the annual record of 21C set in March 2016, according to data from the United States NOAA observatory that goes back to 1982.Although temperatures began to drop at the end of the month, they have remained above seasonal records for the past six weeks, with fears that the looming warming El Nino weather phenomenon could load even more heat into the climate system.The most immediate consequence of the surge in ocean temperatures is more marine heatwaves, which he said \"act like underwater fires\" with the potential to irreversibly degrade thousands of square kilometers of underwater forest\u2014for example of kelp or corals.Higher sea surface temperatures disrupt the mixing of nutrients and oxygen that are key to supporting life and potentially alter the ocean's crucial role in absorbing carbon from the atmosphere.                Graphic showing the rise in global sea surface temperatures since 1982.             \"As the water is warmer, there will be increased evaporation and a high risk of more intense cyclones, and perhaps consequences on ocean currents,\" said oceanologist Catherine Jeandel, of CNRS.Temperatures are also rising throughout the water column and all that heat does not disappear.Scientists expect that excess heat stored in the world's waters will eventually be returned to the Earth system and contribute to more global warming.\"As we heat it up, the ocean becomes a bit like a time bomb,\" said Jeandel.      El NinoThe recent record might be explained by the end of the temporary atmospheric phenomenon known as La Nina\u2014which tends to have a cooling effect\u2014and the expected arrival of its warming opposite, El Nino.\"During El Nino years, the deep ocean releases heat to the surface and warms the atmosphere,\" said Sallee, one of the authors on the landmark UN reports on climate change.But scientists have cautioned that the real concern is the temperature rise over decades\u2014and beyond.When you take into account the background rise in sea surface temperatures, \"2023 doesn't look too out of place relative to other El Nino years,\" climate scientist David Ho, a professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said on Twitter.\"It's the long-term sea surface temperature trend that should alarm us,\" he added.                Sea surface temperatures hit a new high in April.             Heating the deepIn January, an international group of researchers said heat content in the upper oceans in 2022 exceeded the previous year's levels by around 10 Zetta joules\u2014equivalent to 100 times the electricity generation worldwide in 2021.Records going back to the late 1950s show a relentless rise in surface temperatures with almost continuous increases going back to around 1985.While the sea's surface responds relatively quickly to global warming, the deep ocean \"typically adjusts over centuries to millennia\", said Karina Von Schuckmann, a researcher specialized in ocean monitoring at Mercator Ocean.Just like the sea level rise that will play out over hundreds of years as a result of today's carbon emissions, she said ocean heat content will \"continue to increase long after surface temperature stabilizes\".\"In other words, projections suggest that historic ocean warming is irreversible this century\", with the ultimate net warming dependent on our emissions.For Frederic Hourdin, research director at the CNRS Dynamic Meteorology Laboratory, the latest surface temperature should raise awareness of the bigger climate change picture.Clearly, he said, we are still \"not sufficiently aware that the objective is to do without oil and coal\".    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Record sea surface heat sparks fears of warming surge (2023, May 4)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-sea-surface-surge.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Atmospheric rivers\u2014long, concentrated flows of moisture in the sky\u2014are a key factor in the complex conditions accelerating glacial melting over northern Greenland, according to new research from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.          Led by Kyle Mattingly, a researcher at UW\u2013Madison's Space Science and Engineering Center, the new study of the rivers of moisture over Greenland was published in Nature Communications.Sometimes stretching thousands of kilometers, atmospheric rivers transport moisture away from the tropics to other parts of the globe. They are a necessary part of the global weather cycle and can bring needed rains to drought-stricken areas. But they can also contribute to dangerous flooding.\"The Greenland ice sheet has seen an acceleration in glacial melt over the last 30 years,\" says Mattingly. \"Our research shows the major impacts atmospheric rivers can have over the northeast part of the ice sheet.\"Greenland is covered by a 3,000-meter (9,800-foot) thick ice sheet that contains enough water to raise sea levels by 7 meters, or 23 feet. For millennia, it has played a major role in regulating Earth's temperature and climate, but that stability is at risk due to climate change.Warming conditions begin with atmospheric rivers that form on the northwest side of Greenland and move eastward, creating what are known as Foehn winds. The winds commonly occur when moist air meets an elevation change like a mountain or the steep Greenland coastline. As that wet air climbs higher, it condenses and can precipitate in the form of rain or snow, releasing heat into the atmosphere. Now warmer and dryer, the air continues to flow over the ice sheet and back down the northeast side of Greenland.According to Mattingly, these warming conditions are amplified over the northeast Greenland ice stream, an area of fast-moving ice that extends far into the interior and drains a huge chunk of the ice sheet into the ocean. The increase of warm air conditions from atmospheric rivers results in meltwater pools and rivers that absorb more sunlight than the nearby glacier.\"The amount of moisture transported within atmospheric rivers is projected to increase in climate warming scenarios,\" says Mattingly. \"This may increase melt impacts in northeast Greenland if atmospheric circulation patterns continue to favor atmospheric rivers tracking into northwest Greenland.\" More information:Kyle S.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the CU professor who worked on the show?",
  "answer_squad": " Maxwell Boykoff",
  "text": "A new show streaming on Apple TV+ creatively envisions how artificial intelligence, other advanced technologies and climate change might impact people's lives this century. In Extrapolations, Scott Burns\u2014who produced Al Gore's 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth\u2014tells the fictional and interconnected stories of several people living through climate collapse.          Eight episodes, set over a span of 33 years (2037 to 2070), paint a picture of a society that makes great technological strides but fails to limit its carbon emissions: By midcentury, humanity has eradicated cancer and set foot on Mars, but the Earth has also warmed 3.3\u00b0F (1.83\u00b0C) and is drowning beneath 15 inches of sea level rise.Throughout the series, characters don oxygen masks to safely breathe despite toxic air outside, sit through services in synagogues flooded by rising seas, and stay indoors to avoid soaring temperatures that make daytime travel potentially deadly. Miami residents debate whether to take \"ReLo deals,\" or relocation deals, to move to Northern cities, while those who remain plead with the Department of Sea Level Mitigation to save beloved buildings threatened by rising water levels.The film's creator reportedly consulted with Gore, climate activist and writer Bill McKibben and former NASA climate scientist James Hansen, among others, to develop the series. But could any of this really happen in our lifetimes? And is it useful to imagine the future this way? CU Boulder Today spoke with several CU experts to learn more.Is the science accurate? There are moments when the creators nail the science, and a few times they get it wrong, according to Maxwell Boykoff, chair of the Department of Environmental Studies and fellow in the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES).First, temperature: The show posits that by 2037, the average global temperature could be 2.8\u00b0F (1.55\u00b0C) higher than pre-industrial levels. As a result, in fictional 2059, 93 million people are displaced and 1 million die due to extreme heat each year. By 2069, carbon dioxide levels soar to 564 parts per million (ppm), and Earth's average global temperature reaches 4.7\u00b0F (2.59\u00b0C) above pre-industrial levels\u2014144 ppm and 2.8\u00b0F (1.49\u00b0C) more than today. (In 2023, the world is already at 420 ppm of carbon dioxide and 1.9\u00b0F, or 1.1\u00b0C, above pre-industrial levels.)Those numbers are most likely based off one of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) four Representative Concentration Pathways, or RCPs\u2014which are greenhouse gas concentration trajectories\u2014Boykoff said.One RCP, considered an \"intermediate scenario,\" projects that carbon dioxide concentrations will rise above 500 ppm by 2070 and that average global temperature will rise between 3.6\u00b0F (2\u00b0C) and 5.4\u00b0F (3\u00b0C) by 2100. It's considered one of the possible scenarios if the world doesn't do enough to address climate change.So unfortunately, all of this \"is totally in the realm of possibility,\" Boykoff said. \"That level of displacement is certainly possible in our future, which is tragic.\"Extreme events, such as hurricanes, extensive droughts and rising sea levels are already causing people to move within and between countries, Boykoff said. And when it comes to extreme heat, it's often a matter of infrastructure.\"Places aren't set up for that kind of heat,\" Boykoff said, \"and if they're not set up for it, people die.\"      What about the oceans? In an episode set in 2046, a biologist works to document vanishing species. She says the ocean temperature exceeds 90\u00b0F most days and it's too acidic to support krill, a keystone species in the world's oceans. She uses advanced technology to communicate with the last humpback whale, which is hanging on somewhere off the coast of Columbia.Although global sea surface hit a record high temperature in April, Cassandra Brooks doubts that ocean temperatures would exceed 90\u00b0F before 2050, based on the IPCC's recent Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC).Brooks, assistant professor of environmental studies, studies the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, where large numbers of krill live and humpback whales migrate to and from each year. Humpback whale populations are steadily increasing right now, with a full recovery from 20th century harvesting predicted by 2050, and she doesn't see them suddenly dying out two decades from now.She said that while acidification is an alarming threat to the global oceans, it is unlikely the chemistry would change so much as to kill off all krill by mid-century. These small creatures are vulnerable to the array of impacts from climate change\u2014not only acidification, but also warming waters and reductions in sea ice\u2014but even under these cumulative impacts, krill populations are expected to decline and contract poleward, but not to disappear altogether by 2050.\"But there is still a lot of uncertainty about what will happen in the oceans as a result of climate change this century,\" said Brooks.What about the politics? In the first episode, a Tel Aviv-based COP (Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) set in 2037 grapples with increasing the global temperature limit from the 1.5\u00b0C set (in real life) in the historic 2015 Paris COP to a ceiling of 2.0\u00b0C or even 2.3\u00b0C degrees. Palestine compromises on this temperature increase for access to fresh water, and a corporate technology CEO gives a major press conference that has a huge influence on the decision.While it may not have been the most accurate representation of a COP, Boykoff\u2014who has attended six of these climate conferences since 2008\u2014says that based on our current trajectory, this scenario is possible.\"We're going to blow through that 1.5\u00b0 [Celsius] target, and so 2 versus 2.3\u00b0s could very well be the conversation that is being had 14 years from now,\" Boykoff said. \"As in: What is that next threshold that we don't want to cross?\"Climate policy and trade policy are not intertwined today in the way the show depicts, but as water becomes scarce, people will likely come up with ways to try to secure access to it, either by force or through trade, Boykoff said.As there is also already a heavy business presence at these conferences, a corporate CEO having that much influence at a future climate change conference is again within the realm of possibility, he said.How is this helpful? Boykoff, author of Creative (Climate) Communications and lead project investigator for the Media and Climate Change Observatory (MeCCO), points out that there is no silver bullet strategy for effectively communicating climate change and its impacts to the public.Different audiences respond differently to certain approaches. While his work with Inside the Greenhouse at CU Boulder focuses on using comedy to address the issue, he said that \"some of these darker approaches can reach different audiences in a really effective way.\"This show is valuable in that \"it meets people where they are,\" he said. \"It brings that future into the messiness of the here and now.\"For example, some people might think: \"I don't want that future!\" and take action, he said.Will we see climate change more often in popular media? Rick Stevens, associate professor of media studies in the College of Media, Information and Communication, previously noted that this uptick in science fiction content may be due to the smaller budgets and economic flexibility that come with streaming services.\"Because of the rise of the number of quality streaming shows and movies about important social issues, there are more people willing to use these platforms to say important things,\" Stevens said.Boykoff agrees. He previously helped with the online action platform that accompanied Don't Look Up, has since been invited to speak at the Hollywood Climate Summit in June and is now on Netflix's advisory team for sustainability.Personally, he would love to see comedy used more to raise awareness of climate change and examine climate actions. If given a green light and a budget, he would create a Portlandia-esque TV show about the climate hub that is Boulder.His working title: \"Boulder Than Thou.\" Provided byUniversity of Colorado at BoulderCitation:Fact or fiction?

  "text": "Volcanic eruptions are spectacular, violent and dangerous. Large explosive eruptions can even have global impacts. To classify the size of volcanic eruptions, the magma volume and the deposition volume are determined. Volcanologists estimate these values in order to compare the size of different volcanic eruptions or to obtain a measure of the explosiveness of the eruption. However, it is often not possible to determine the values accurately.          This makes it difficult to infer the actual volume of magma and to measure the complete extent of such eruptions. In particular, because the deposits of the most violent historical eruptions are partially or completely under water, which makes geological investigations difficult. This has also prevented the accurate sizing of past eruptions and thus a reliable risk assessment.An international team of researchers led by marine geoscientist Dr. Jens Karstens of GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel has now, for the first time, combined the latest geophysical and geological methods to resurvey the Minoan eruption, which took place 3,600 years ago, of the Greek island of Santorini.Their study has now been published in the journal Nature Communications. The analyses presented within lead to one of the most accurately determined volume estimates of any large volcanic eruption, and provide an approach to better classify and measure other volcanic eruptions worldwide. The publication thus provides a basis for better assessing the hazard of such events and establishes a benchmark for more precisely determining magma volumes.\"Volcanic eruptions can result in measurable effects worldwide, such as a global temperature decrease,\" says Dr. Karstens, lead author of the study. \"While we can assess climate change risks through models, and we have a relatively good understanding of the risk from earthquakes, we are much worse off when it comes to volcanoes. We have a blind spot there. It is therefore essential that we learn to assess the consequences of large explosive volcanic eruptions more accurately. To better assess the risk, it is necessary to know how frequently eruptions of a certain size occur. The basis for this is volume calculations that are as precise as possible. We have made an important contribution to this with our study of the Minoan eruption.\"                Excavation site of the city of Akrotiri on Santorini, buried by the Minoan eruption. Credit: Jonas Preine             The Minoans were the earliest advanced civilization in Europe. The eruption named after them took place about 3,600 years ago in the Holocene epoch, burying an entire city, now the excavation site of Akrotiri. Estimates from previous calculations suggested that the eruption was as large as 86 cubic kilometers of ejected magma. This would have made it one of the largest in the past 10,000 years. The science team's new analysis yields much smaller numbers: Only one-third to one-half as large, 26\u201341 cubic kilometers, was the event at the time, according to current estimates.      For their calculations of the volcanic magnitude, the researchers combined different methods from several research cruises. For example, they were able to detect ash deposits from the Minoan eruption in 41 sediment cores collected during research cruise POS513 aboard the research vessel POSEIDON in 2017, and thereby determine the ash volume of the eruption.Because ejected magma solidifies into material with varying porosities, they used a computed tomography-based technique to determine the density of the sediment cores and thus the actual pure magma volume ejected. Using seismic reflection data from research cruise POS538, they also identified and characterized the deposition of pyroclastic flows\u2014avalanches of hot gases, ash, and debris ejected by the volcanic eruption\u2014around the island. These data also enabled them to characterize material that fell into the center of the crater, known as the caldera.Combining the data collected, the scientists were able to draw conclusions about the extent of the Minoan eruption. This is the first time that such precise values have been calculated for all individual components. Estimates of the eruption volume were previously based either on estimates of the volume of the caldera collapse or on incomplete estimates of the eruption products. Both approaches by themselves are limited in their explanatory power.\"Volcanic eruptions can costs lives and affect climate. Our results contribute another piece to the puzzle of understanding explosive volcanic eruptions and their magnitudes, which should lead to improved risk assessments,\" says Dr. Karstens.

UC Ph.D. student Cameron McErlich used a range of models and satellite observations to examine daily rainfall. \"Through the research we discovered that if you know how often it rains annually in one place you can make a strong prediction of the size and likelihood of extreme rainfall in that place.\"\"By watching changes in rainfall occurrence, we can use our findings to understand regions where extremes might change.

  "answer_squad": " Environmental Research: Health",
  "text": "A new study, published in the journal Environmental Research: Health, reveals that Indigenous people in the Amazon Basin are twice as likely to die prematurely from smoke exposure due to wildfires than the broader South American population. Regions in Peru, Bolivia and Brazil are identified as particular hotspots for smoke exposure, with mortality rates rising to as high as 6 times that of the general population.          The results show that smoke from wildfires in South America account for approximately 12,000 premature deaths every year from 2014 to 2019, with approximately 230 of these deaths occurring in Indigenous territories. Exposure to harmful smoke particles is found to be much higher during the Amazonian dry season, from July to November each year, when wildfires more than double the increase in PM2.5 concentrations.Dr. Eimy Bonilla, lead author of the study, says, \"While Indigenous territories account for relatively few fires in the Amazon Basin, our research shows that the people living in these territories experience significantly greater health risks from smoke particles, compared to the general population.\"Previous research in the field focuses on the health impacts of countries on larger scales or is heavily reliant on hospital admission data. This does not accurately highlight the impact on people living in Indigenous territories as they are often located much closer to the fires, are exposed to smoke particles for longer periods of time, and lack access to appropriate medical care, hygiene materials, and clean water.The new study, led by researchers at Harvard University, uses a combination of atmospheric chemical transport models and an updated concentration response function to estimate the rate of premature mortality for Indigenous populations exposed to high concentrations of PM2.5.In recent years, the rate of biomass burning in South America has surged. This surge is driven by forest degradation due to human activity (such as mining, logging, and agricultural land use) as well as variations in climate conditions. Wildfires release tiny smoke particles called PM2.5, which are known to significantly contribute to aerosol concentrations and negatively impact human health.Exposure to these particles can result in cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, cancer, premature births, metabolic dysfunction, and other physiological symptoms. Smoke particles from biomass burning in the Amazon Basin travel great distances, affecting air quality across several countries in South America.\"These fires are having a disproportionate impact on people living in Indigenous territories. With longer exposure times, and limited access to medical attention, Indigenous populations are at much greater risk of death from fires,\" says Bonilla. \"We recommend that governments provide financial assistance to monitor air quality in these regions, supplying low-cost sensors to study the impact of short- and long-term exposure to the smoke.\" More information:Health impacts of smoke exposure in South America: Increased risk for populations in the Amazonian Indigenous territories, Environmental Research: Health (2023).

  "text": "The Grand Canyon is visited by millions of admirers each year. So, naturally, you'd think that all of its rock layers had been studied and named. But you'd be wrong.          In a new report published this spring in the journal Geosphere, a UNLV-led research team outlines how it identified and bestowed a moniker upon a previously unexplored 500 million-year-old Grand Canyon formation: The Frenchman Mountain Dolostone.The newly named rock layer has lain hidden in plain sight throughout the Grand Canyon for millennia, but\u2014until now\u2014geologists had not named it or studied it in detail.The UNLV research team named it the Frenchman Mountain Dolostone (FMD) \u2014after a similarly named mountain that lies adjacent to Las Vegas, Nevada. That's where the FMD is thickest, most complete, and most accessible for study. Through scientific detective work, the researchers were able to narrow down the age of this stratigraphic interval and its relationship to strata in the Grand Canyon.\"For decades, geologists were unable to precisely correlate the succession of strata at Frenchman Mountain with those in the Grand Canyon, in part because Frenchman Mountain was tectonically displaced about 40 miles to the west since the rocks were deposited,\" said lead author Steve Rowland, an emeritus professor of geology at UNLV and paleontologist at the Las Vegas Natural History Museum. \"Establishing detailed descriptions and thickness measurements of the strata at Frenchman Mountain and also in the Grand Canyon has finally allowed us to solve this problem.\"                Quartermaster Canyon (Arizona) exposure, with stratigraphic units labeled. Frenchman Mountain Dolostone here is 117m thick. Credit: Stephen Rowland/UNLV             The FMD is over 1,200 feet thick at Frenchman Mountain, Rowland said, but it thins dramatically toward the east. The portions exposed within the Grand Canyon range in thickness from nearly 400 feet near the \"West Rim\" Skywalk to less than 100 feet in Marble Canyon, in the eastern part of Grand Canyon National Park.In 1945, geologist Edwin McKee distinguished\u2014but did not formally name\u2014the cliff-forming interval of rocks that occur just above the well-known Muav Formation. The FMD contains no fossils, so McKee was unsure of its age. Rowland's team used a relatively new technique to determine the FMD's age\u2015subtle differences in the ratio of stable isotopes of carbon. Fluctuations in the ratios of these isotopes occurred at the same time all over the Earth as the layers were deposited.The researchers compared fluctuations in the Frenchman Mountain strata with those identified in precisely dated rock layers elsewhere in the world. The results indicate that the newly named formation was deposited over an interval of 7.3 million years, during the Cambrian Period, between 502.8 million and 495.5 million years ago.The FMD is the first new formation to be named in the canyon since 1985 when the Surprise Canyon Formation was named. It is also the first rock layer exposed in the Grand Canyon to be named for a location outside the Grand Canyon region.In addition to Rowland, the research team included former UNLV graduate student Slava Korolev, Denver Museum of Nature and Science geologist James Hagadorn, and UNLV mathematics professor Kaushik Ghosh.

  "question_squad": " What is the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere?",
  "answer_squad": " 0.04 percent",
  "text": "The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has now made its message very clear. Our actions during the next seven years will influence the development of the global climate for the next one thousand. This means that we must make use of all measures available to limit the rise in global temperatures.          In a DAC facility, carbon dioxide is effectively 'vacuumed' from the atmosphere, thus reducing its concentration in the air and mitigating its greenhouse effect. DAC technology is useful because it has the potential to help remove CO2 directly from the air, and not simply arrest the emission of CO2 from fossil sources. However, DAC facilities also present a challenge because they have to process large volumes of air in order to achieve a discernible impact, thus making the process expensive.\"The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is only 0.04 percent,\" says Jon Hovland, who is a Chief Research Scientist at SINTEF Industry. \"Because of this low concentration, a lot of energy is needed to extract the gas, and facilities require a large area. This makes the cost per ton of captured CO2 very high,\" he says.What do we need to do to roll out DAC in Norway?Around the globe, we know of about 18 test and demonstration facilities for DAC, operating with a combined annual capture capacity of about 9,000 tons of CO2. The largest facility currently in operation is in Iceland, capable of capturing up to 4,000 tons of the gas annually.In Norway there are many factors in favor of the country being able to develop a DAC infrastructure. Norway has major volumes of geological storage capacity on its continental shelf, favorable climatic conditions and high levels of expertise in the fields of carbon capture and storage (CCS).Many Norwegian companies are in the process of evaluating or actively planning the construction of DAC facilities based either on technology developed entirely in Norway or in collaboration with overseas companies. So, what is needed for these plans to become a reality?SINTEF has carried out a study for the Norwegian Environment Agency and has concluded that more research is needed into DAC technology. A key part of such work will be to learn from our current experience in terms of keeping energy consumption and costs as low as possible. As the technology matures, construction and operational costs will fall, and energy costs will constitute an ever-increasing proportion of total costs because energy consumption is directly linked to the volume of CO2 that is captured.In its own report, the Environment Agency points out that DAC technology will require operational subsidies if negative emissions are not to be assessed using other instruments. Such instruments may include the Norwegian state 'mirroring' the existing CO2 tax with a reverse tax per ton of CO2. In such a scenario, companies will be paid for each ton of CO2 they remove from the atmosphere. Such a measure can be combined with funding for technology development and perhaps also for the establishment of a transport and storage infrastructure.\"DAC technology offers major potential, but it is important to emphasize that it will be complementary, and not an alternative, to measures such as CCS technologies being applied to achieve the reduction of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\" says Hovland.

  "text": "The experiences of people affected by the extreme floods in New South Wales and Queensland in 2022 are providing vital insights on preparedness, response and the early stages of recovery to help reduce future flood risk.          Findings from independent research conducted by Natural Hazards Research Australia in partnership with Macquarie University, the University of Southern Queensland and the Queensland University of Technology were released today at the Natural Hazards Research Forum in the report, Community experiences of the January\u2014July 2022 floods in New South Wales and Queensland.A total of 192 flood-impacted residents (100 in New South Wales/92 in Queensland) were interviewed using an approach that invited residents to share their flood story. A further 430 residents participated in an online survey.Lead researcher and occupational psychologist A/Prof Mel Taylor from Macquarie University said the personal experiences of those impacted by the floods are captured by the research.\"Each person's experience is unique and the power of this research is that it captures the lived experiences\u2014before the floods, during the floods, and the early recovery stage\u2014of so many people who have been through some of the worst flooding on record in Australia, and some people multiple times,\" A/Prof Taylor said.\"What we found is that there are big picture issues that affect how people were impacted by the floods\u2014community connection and communication, local capacity for action, flexibility in disaster adaptation and personal control over decision making. If we can make change in these areas we can improve not just disaster preparedness, response and recovery, but capacity for managing any kind of adversity.\"The research report provides vital context that will assist emergency management organizations, government departments, local councils, community organizations and community members in better understanding the complexities of community experiences before, during and after severe weather.The results of the research will be used to inform strategies to improve flood safety across Australia explained Andrew Gissing, CEO of Natural Hazards Research Australia.\"There are always lessons to be learnt from each and every natural hazard. The insights from this research apply right across Australia and show the complexity in which people experience a natural hazard, in this case flood.\"      \"There is no one definitive flood experience but we can make change to improve the outcome when it starts raining. The detailed knowledge available from this research will inform insights nationwide and shape the future we need as we work towards making communities safer from the severe weather we know will worsen,\" Gissing explained.The report identifies themes from the community interviews and surveys, including the accuracy of flood data, the inclusion of local knowledge, the need for timely official information, the sense of being forgotten, the changing role of community responders, and the impacts of planning decisions and infrastructure maintenance.Respondents reported a range of challenges arising from the large-scale clean-up, insurance claims, the bureaucracy of financial support, temporary housing, and the longer-term struggles with \"community recovery fatigue.\"The researchers investigated the levels of preparedness and the role of prior flooding experience to identify why some residents were more prepared than others and what actions they had taken. Residents were also asked what actions they took in the lead up to and during the floods, and the challenges they faced.The researchers also asked how residents received information and who they trusted for information. They looked at the types of housing impacted, their pre-flood modifications and the challenges posed in reconstruction under the threat of future floods. They assessed the residents' satisfaction with the support provided by external organizations and the community.There are four broad challenge areas identified by the research. These are:the gradual erosion of trustthe need to embrace self-activating communities and integrate community into all phases of disastermanaging the long-term psychological impacts of an increasingly complex disaster landscapethe need to see disaster support as part of a holistic person-centered approach.NSW State Emergency Service Commissioner Carlene York APM said the research provides a wealth of data following several years of severe to catastrophic flooding.\"We have seen significant impacts on communities, many of which still have a long period of recovery ahead and are at risk of future flood events. This research is vital to address gaps and improve community preparedness and safety,\" Commissioner York said.\"It is through learning from community experiences and working together that we grow our collective capability to improve community safety before and during disasters, and to recover afterwards. The important insights gained through this research project will inform future preparedness, response and recovery work undertaken by the NSW SES.\"A/Commissioner Mike Wassing of the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services said accurately gauging, considering and applying community experience and perspective is an important part of contemporary emergency service agencies and the services they deliver.\"This research demonstrates that community members directly impacted by the 2022 rainfall and flood events have valuable insights that they are willing to share, together with an optimism that lessons learned from their tragedy can genuinely contribute to the evolution of prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery policy. QFES looks forward to seeing the uptake and application of these important findings and to expanding research partnerships on further community-focused topics.\" More information:Community experiences of the 2022 Australian floods: www.naturalhazards.com.au/floods2022Provided byNatural Hazards Research AustraliaCitation:Australian report: Flood-threatened communities strengthened by their collective insights (2023, May 3)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-australian-flood-threatened-communities-insights.html  This document is subject to copyright.

However, these frameworks generally use detailed assessments and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods that are time-consuming and require specialist training or software.\"Consequently, existing frameworks typically compare only two or three FLW management options and do not consider a broad range of available options because it is too expensive. The SeqFLoW framework we developed allows a company to identify a broad range of FLW management options and shortlists options according to key indicators.\"For instance, when considering citrus processing waste, where up to 50%\u201360% of the fresh fruit weight is discarded as pulp, peel and seeds, we identified more than 80 possible management options and using the SeqFLoW framework we were able to shortlist five options for further consideration.\"The SeqFLoW framework is designed to be accessible and require minimal time, effort and resources, with data that can be acquired primarily through desk-based research. Shortlisting criteria within the SeqFLoW framework is based on key indicators of success or failure, which we identified from critical success factors for circular business models using agricultural waste and by-products.\"These critical success factors can be broadly categorized as technology readiness, market factors, environmental performance, social acceptability and legislative support.\"Jones said food waste could be processed or treated to extract value that would otherwise be lost and potentially reduce the embedded environmental, economic and social impacts.\"While prevention of food waste or redistributing it to humans or animals are preferable options, they are dependent on such variables as food quality and edibility, consumer attractiveness and a reliable redistribution network.\"If these strategies are not feasible, other options include recycling and recovery of valuable components, such as vitamins, lipids, minerals and enzymes or further processing into biomaterials, fertilizers or energy products.\"Additionally, transport distances, market demand, location, product price, energy and chemical demand, required capital and infrastructure, policies, waste legislation and trade agreements also affect the feasibility of a process.\"Jones said that the SeqFLoW framework enables food growers, manufacturers and retailers to assess a broad range of FLW management options, to identify potentially suitable FLW solutions for their business.\"The SeqFLoW framework identifies and assesses key economic and market factors that can be acquired from desk-based research, to provide a high-level overview of the competitiveness of the short-listed processes.\"\"SeqFLoW: A systematic approach to identify and select food waste valorisation opportunities\" was published in Resources, Conservation and Recycling.

  "text": "A team of researchers, using a state-of-the-art climate prediction system, is forecasting a strong El Ni\u00f1o toward the end of 2023. If westerly wind bursts were to occur during the spring and early summer, an even stronger El Ni\u00f1o event might occur.          Their study was published in the journal Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Research on April 24.\"The upper ocean heat content in the winter of 2022 ranks the largest over the past 40 years. Since the heat content serves as a primary precursor for an upcoming El Ni\u00f1o, we showed by a set of model experiments that within the low-frequency atmosphere-ocean coupling, the current heat content is sufficient for boosting a strong El Ni\u00f1o toward the end of 2023,\" said Tao Lian, a professor from the Second Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of Natural Resources, China.The El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation cycle is the name scientists give to the strong, recurring climate pattern over the tropical Pacific Ocean. It has widespread impact on the global climate and human society. Scientists have long recognized that the occurrence of an El Ni\u00f1o is often preceded by the buildup of the upper ocean heat content in the equatorial western Pacific about six to nine months ahead of the El Ni\u00f1o.Because of the regular recharge and discharge of the upper ocean heat content, scientists are able to predict the El Ni\u00f1o using dynamic models, far in advance of the El Ni\u00f1o's arrival. However, disturbances, known as atmospheric high-frequency perturbations and initial errors, can cause uncertainty in the real-time forecasts. The research team noticed that the buildup of the ocean's heat content seems ripe for the development of a strong El Ni\u00f1o in late 2023. To confirm its potential impact on the ongoing El Ni\u00f1o , they evaluated the effects of both heat content and high-frequency perturbations, along with the uncertainty in initial conditions, using data analysis and a series of real-time forecast experiments.The previous La Ni\u00f1a ended around March 2023. It was an unusually long cold event that lasted from the winter of 2020 to the spring of 2023. The team examined the thermocline depth data for late 2022 to early 2023. Thermocline is the transition layer between the warmer waters near the ocean surface and the cooler deep waters. When the thermocline depth is greater than normal in the western Pacific, it is likely that an El Ni\u00f1o will occur in the coming year. They compared this recent data with thermocline data from 1982, 1997, and 2015. Those years displayed deeper-than normal thermocline preceding the start of three extreme El Ni\u00f1o events.The team also conducted forecast experiments using a state-of-the-art El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation ensemble prediction system. The predictions point to a moderate strength El Ni\u00f1o coming in late 2023. Next the team reduced the uncertainty in the predictions by filtering out some of the weather influences from outside the tropical Pacific. With this more refined data, the team views the stage being set for a stronger El Ni\u00f1o coming in late 2023.In addition to examining the ocean's heat content, the team also looked at high-frequency perturbations, namely westerly wind bursts and easterly wind surges, both of which have strong influences on the El Ni\u00f1o. These disturbances are capable of increasing or decreasing the intensity of the El Ni\u00f1o. Yet the ocean's heat content buildup alone seems to be sufficient for boosting a strong El Ni\u00f1o in late 2023. \"A strong El Ni\u00f1o is upcoming, and this daring prediction is not sensitive to initial errors within the tropical Pacific,\" said Lian.Looking ahead, the team hopes to continue refining their prediction. \"The high-frequency perturbations in spring and early summer play a crucial role in El Ni\u00f1o intensity and structure. We hope that we can further improve El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation prediction skill via combining the seasonal forecast model of the high-frequency perturbations with the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation prediction system,\" said Dake Chen from the Second Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of Natural Resources, China.

The legislation adopted by lawmakers in the Democratic-run state legislature late Tuesday will require newly built homes to be all-electric in three years' time.The move aims to tackle climate change by reducing New York's dependence on natural gas.\"Changing the ways we make and use energy to decrease our reliance on fossil fuels will help ensure a healthier environment for us and our children,\" said state assembly speaker Carl Heastie.The law, which could face legal challenges from the gas industry, will require solely electric heating and cooking in new buildings under seven stories from 2026.For taller skyscrapers, the deadline is 2029.Hospitals, critical infrastructure such as transportation, and commercial food establishments will be exempt.The law will also not apply to buildings where the local grid is not capable of handling the load.Existing buildings are also not affected by the legislation, meaning residents can keep gas stoves they already have.The appliances became an unlikely flashpoint in America's bitterly partisan politics earlier this year when a federal official suggested the government might ban new gas stoves over concerns they cause harmful air pollution indoors.Representatives from the fossil fuel industry and Republican allies slammed the comments by Richard Trumka Jr, a member of the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the White House was forced to clarify that stoves would not be banned.According to the US Energy Department, 52 percent of households in New York state use natural gas for heating or cooking.New York's measure was included in a $229 billion budget that local lawmakers approved for the state.The budget also authorizes the New York Power Authority, the state-owned public utility provider, to build and operate renewable energy facilities.That move is to help New York meet its goal of reducing emissions by 85 percent by 2050.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:New York becomes first US state to ban gas in new buildings (2023, May 3)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-york-state-gas.html  This document is subject to copyright.

Under California's high-risk aversion scenario, which projects that sea levels could rise by more than 6 feet by the end of the century, the study identified 736 facilities at risk of coastal flooding and an additional 173 with projected groundwater encroachment. Residents living within 1 kilometer of at-risk sites were more likely than others to be people of color, to be living below the poverty line, to be unemployed or to experience another form of social disadvantage such as linguistic isolation.As part of the study, the researchers also released a new interactive online tool in English and Spanish that allows users to map toxic sites that are at risk of coastal flooding, either by county or by individual facility. Users can also overlay indicators of nearby residents' social vulnerability, including the percentage of people who are living below the poverty line, who are experiencing unemployment, or who don't have a high school degree.\"Sea level rise is like a slow-moving storm that we can anticipate and prepare for,\" said Rachel Morello-Frosch, a professor of public health and of environmental science, policy and management at UC Berkeley and senior author of the paper. \"As California invests in community resilience to climate change, it is essential that considerations of environmental justice are at the fore.\"                A map of hazardous sites at risk of coastal flooding in the San Francisco Bay Area, generated by the new coastal risk screening tool available on the Climate Central website.

Credit: Climate Central             Low-income communities and communities of color already face disproportionate exposure to myriad environmental pollutants, and the threat of additional exposures from sea-level rise will only exacerbate these inequities. Compared to their neighbors, socially vulnerable residents can also face more challenges to evacuate during a flood and often experience social stressors that can make them more susceptible to the health impacts of pollutant exposures.San Mateo and Alameda counties are projected to host the most at-risk hazardous sites by 2050, but by 2100, Orange County is projected to surpass both as oil and gas wells there and in Los Angeles County face rising coastal flood risks.\"Again, climate change amplifies inequality,\" said lead author Lara Cushing, an assistant professor of environmental health sciences at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. \"Sea level rise will present additional risks of contaminant releases to communities already living with pollution sources in their backyards.\"The study was conducted as part of the Toxic Tides project, which brought together a multidisciplinary research team with community advocacy organizations to understand how rising seas would impact hazardous sites, including refineries, industrial facilities, sewage treatment plants and cleanup sites. The team released a preliminary set of data and an earlier version of the online mapping tool in November 2021; the new study, which appears in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, includes additional analysis about the environmental justice implications of the findings.

(The world's average surface temperature in the 20th century was 13.9\u2103.)But almost all of this energy to date has been taken up by the oceans. It's no wonder we're seeing rapid warming in our oceans.The Goldilocks zoneMercury is the closest planet to the Sun. It gets hot, at an average temperature of 167\u2103. But it has no atmosphere. That's why the second planet, Venus, is the hottest in the solar system, at an average of 464\u2103. That's due to an atmosphere much thicker than Earth's, dense in carbon dioxide. Venus might once have had liquid oceans. But then a runaway greenhouse effect took place, trapping truly enormous quantities of heat.One reason we're alive is that our planet orbits in the Goldilocks zone, just the right distance from the Sun to be not too hot and not too cold. Little of the Earth's internal heat gets through to the cold crust where we live. That makes us dependent on another source of heat\u2014the Sun.When the Sun's light and heat hits Earth, some is absorbed at the surface and some is reflected back out into space. We see some of the energy emitted by the Sun because the Sun is hot and hotter objects emit radiation in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum.                Incoming radiation from the sun is reflected or absorbed by Earth. There is a net imbalance where more energy is absorbed than emitted by the planet and this causes warming. Credit: NASA, CC BY             Because Earth is much cooler than the Sun, the radiation it emits is invisible, at long infrared wavelengths. Much of this energy goes out into space\u2014but not all. Some gases in our atmosphere are very effective at absorbing energy at the wavelengths Earth emits at. These greenhouse gases occur naturally in Earth's atmosphere, and keep the planet warm enough to be habitable. That's another Goldilocks zone.And then there's a third Goldilocks zone: recent history. All of human civilization has emerged in the unusually mild 10,000 years after the last ice age, when the climate has been not too hot and not too cold across much of the world.But now, we are at very real risk of pushing ourselves outside of the comfortable climatic conditions which allowed humans to expand, farm, build cities and create.The energy dense fuels which made industrial civilization possible come with an enormous sting in the tail. Burn now, pay later. Now the bill has become apparent.How do we know this is real? Satellites measure the rate at which Earth's surface radiates heat. At any one moment, thousands of Argo robotic floats dot our oceans. They spend almost all of their lives underwater, measuring heat, and surface to transmit data. And we can measure sea level with tide levels and satellites. We can cross-check the measurements between all three approaches.      Climate change: more energy comes in than goes outGreenhouse gases are potent. You only need small concentrations to get a big effect.We've already boosted the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by about 50%, and added considerable volumes of methane and nitrous oxide as well. This is pushing our life-sustaining greenhouse effect out of balance.A recent study suggests the energy imbalance is equivalent to trapping roughly 380 zettajoules of extra heat from 1971\u20132020. (The period between 1971 and the present accounts for about 60% of all emissions).One zettajoule is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 joules\u2014a very big number!                Where\u2019s the heat? In our oceans. This sea surface temperature map shows the temperature anomalies above or below the long term average at 30th April 2023. Credit: NOAA, CC BY Little Boy, the nuclear bomb which destroyed Hiroshima, produced energy estimated at 15,000,000,000,000 joules. This means the effect of humanity's greenhouse gas emissions in that 50-year period to 2020 is about 25 billion times the energy emitted by the Hiroshima nuclear bomb.If we've trapped so much extra heat, where is it?To date, almost every joule of extra energy\u2014about 90%\u2014has gone into our oceans, particularly the top kilometer of water. Water is an excellent heat sink. It takes a lot of energy to heat it, but heat it we have. Hotter oceans are a major contributor to coral bleaching and sea level rise.It takes a long time to get this much heat into the oceans, and once it is there it doesn't disappear. Reversing global warming entirely may not be feasible. Just to stop temperatures going any higher means correcting the imbalance and bringing CO2 levels down towards the pre-industrial level of 280ppm.If we can reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, we will most likely stop further global warming and carbon dioxide concentrations will slowly start to drop.Realistically, this means rapid, large-scale reduction of emissions and deployment of carbon capture to compensate for the emissions we can't eliminate.To go further and cool the planet back down towards a pre-industrial climate would require net-negative emissions, meaning we would have to draw even more carbon back out of the atmosphere than any lingering emissions.Unfortunately, we aren't there yet. Human-caused greenhouse gas emissions are at near-record highs. But clean energy production is accelerating. This year might be the first time emissions from power begin to fall.We're in a race, and the stakes are as high as they could possibly be\u2014ensuring a liveable climate for our children and for nature.

  "text": "Cigarette filters are the world's most common form of litter. Researchers from the University of Gothenburg can now show that the filters leak thousands of toxins and plastic fibers that are toxic to aquatic larvae. The researchers are therefore calling for these filters to be completely banned.          On the footpath, at the bus stop, in the park and on the beach. You can hardly avoid seeing cigarette butts in the streetscape. And these butts aren't just butt-ugly to behold\u2014they're also really bad for the environment. A research group at the University of Gothenburg has shown in a study that microfibers and the chemicals that leak out of the filters in cigarette butts are toxic to aquatic larvae.\"The filter is full of thousands of toxic chemicals and microplastic fibers, so it's not just any piece of plastic that's being discarded into the environment. It's hazardous waste,\" says Bethanie Carney Almroth, Professor of Ecotoxicology at the University of Gothenburg.Cigarette filters killed mosquito larvaeIn the study, which has been published in the journal Microplastics and Nanoplastics, the researchers tested the effects of the toxins that are found in the filter after smoking, as well as the substances that are in the filter from the start, on aquatic mosquito larvae.It turns out that the toxins lead to a 20% higher mortality rate among mosquito larvae. Previous research has shown that the toxins in the filters also have adverse effects on many other aquatic organisms. For example, fish can die if they are exposed to concentrations corresponding to the toxins exuded by barely two cigarette butts in one liter of water for four days.\"Cigarette filters are also a major source of the microplastics that find their way into our environment\u2014something we know has a major negative impact on biological life. The EU has already classified cigarette filters as hazardous waste,\" says Professor Carney Almroth.Cigarette butts are thrown on the groundFrom the turn of the year, it will be the tobacco producers who have to pay for cleaning up cigarette butts. But it's not enough to just put out more ashtrays. The researchers also observed in the study how smokers in Gothenburg behave when it's time to put out their cigarettes. It turns out that many people throw their cigarette butts on the ground even if there are ashtrays nearby.\"The clean-up costs the municipalities millions of kronor, but there will still be many cigarette butts in the environment. We are now conducting a survey of plastic litter across all of Sweden with the aid of community science in what we're calling the Plastics experiment. That way, we can work with school children and others to get better figures on where and how many cigarette butts with filters are found in the environment, in addition to other problematic plastic products,\" says Professor Carney Almroth.She doesn't think there are any good arguments at all for filters to remain a component of cigarettes. Along with other experts, Professor Carney Almroth has written an opinion piece in the magazine Science of the Total Environment arguing that cigarette butts are not just the most common litter item in the world, they are also just a marketing ploy that do little to protect the smoker, as many people believe they do.\"That's why they have to be taken off the market entirely,\" says Professor Carney Almroth. \"It's not the right approach to focus on making tobacco producers pay for cleaning up the filters. The problem should be prevented in the first place, rather than cleaned up later,\" says Professor Carney Almroth.

  "text": "Senior officials from dozens of nations meeting in Berlin remained divided Wednesday on how to meet international climate goals, with some pushing for a phaseout of fossil fuels and others insisting that oil and gas can continue to play a role in the future\u2014provided their emissions are somehow contained.          The two-day Petersberg Climate Dialogue hosted by Germany heard calls for a new target on ramping up renewable energy to be negotiated and agreed on at this year's U.N. climate summit in December.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz suggested that the goal could be a tripling of newly installed solar, wind power by 2030, echoing a target proposed recently by the International Renewable Energy Agency.\"This would send a clear signal to the real economy and to finance about where the journey is going,\" he told delegates from about 40 countries.German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock insisted this proposal shouldn't detract from the need to drastically cut fossil fuel use, a position shared by other European nations and vulnerable island states present at the Berlin talks.\"This course correction needs to include an accelerated global expansion of renewables, greater energy efficiency and the phaseout of fossil fuels,\" she said.The United Arab Emirates, which will host the U.N. talks in Dubai, backed the idea of significantly boosting wind and solar power, but made clear that it wants to keep fossil fuels as an option for the foreseeable future.                Wind turbines turn behind a solar farm in Rapshagen, Germany, Oct. 28, 2021.

Credit: AP Photo/Michael Sohn, File             Sultan al-Jaber, the UAE official who will chair COP28 climate talks in Dubai, said his oil-rich country wants \"a comprehensive, holistic approach to an energy transition that included all sources of energy.\"\"We know that fossil fuel will continue to play a role in the foreseeable future, helping meet global requirements so our aim should be a focus on ensuring that we phase out emissions from all sectors whether it's oil and gas or high emitting industries,\" he said. \"In parallel we should assert all effort and all investments in renewable energy and clean technology space.\"Al-Jaber acknowledged that time is running out to keep alive the agreed on target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit). Doing so would require global emissions to halve by 2030, sharply bending down the current upward curve of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.      Climate campaigners and scientists have expressed concern that technologies proposed for capturing fossil fuel emissions aren't tested at scale yet, and that such solutions could divert attention and resources away from effective alternatives such as renewable energy.John M. Silk, the Marshall Islands' minister for natural resource and commerce, raised similar concerns.\"We have to actually phase out fossil fuels now,\" said Silk, whose low-lying Pacific atoll is threatened by rising sea levels. He called for governments at the Berlin meeting to \"move beyond commitments into actual action.\"\"That means halting oil and gas expansion,\" he said. \"It means investing in renewables. That is the best way for countries to develop in a way that is fairer and more just.\"                UAE Minister of State and the CEO of Abu Dhabi's state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.

Credit: Bernd von Jutrczenka/dpa via AP             More than 80 countries backed efforts to put oil and gas, not just coal, on notice at the last U.N. climate summit in Egypt. Denmark's climate minister, Dan J\u00f8rgensen, said that the proposal is on the table again this year.\"Objections against this are primarily from countries that are today mainly producers or extremely dependent on fossil fuels,\" he told The Associated Press.J\u00f8rgensen said that carbon capture and storage of the kind his country is testing in the North Sea should be confined to sectors where cutting emissions is hardest, such as the cement industry.Scholz used the meeting to announce that his country will provide an additional 2 billion euros to the Green Climate Fund for adaptation measures in developing countries. He appealed to other \"traditional and possible new donors\" to also increase their funding. The United States recently said it would commit $1 billion, while major emitters such as China aren't contributing.Germany itself has come under criticism for failing to drive down emissions fast enough to meet its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2045.Scholz expressed regret that his country recently increased coal use because of a shortfall in gas from Russia, but said that Germany remains committed to producing 80% of its electricity from renewables by 2030.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

  "text": "Indigenous communities living near oil exploration sites in the Peruvian Amazon have high levels of mercury, cadmium and lead in their bodies. This is the conclusion of a study led by Cristina O'Callaghan Gordo, a researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal). She is also a professor in the Faculty of Health Sciences at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) and co-director of the Interuniversity Master's Degree in Planetary Health (UOC, ISGlobal and Pompeu Fabra University).          The study, published in Environmental Health Perspectives, found high levels of these three metals in the urine of Indigenous people living in four river basins in the northern Peruvian Amazon, where oil exploration began in the 1970s. This is currently one of the most polluted areas in the country. Previous research led by ISGlobal had already reported high levels of lead in the blood of the local population. New data have now been published for mercury, arsenic and cadmium, three metals that are toxic to humans.Arsenic and cadmium are carcinogens. Exposure to arsenic can cause lung, bladder, skin, liver, and kidney cancer. And exposure to cadmium can cause lung, prostate and kidney cancer. In addition, arsenic can have other serious health consequences, such as skin lesions, liver and kidney damage, a decrease in red and white blood cells, and developmental delay in children.Cadmium, for its part, can cause breathing problems, kidney disease, bone fragility, reproductive problems, and cardiovascular disease. Finally, continued exposure to mercury can cause neurological damage and altered cognitive function, damage the nervous system of fetuses and children, and cause kidney and immune system diseases.Active involvement of Indigenous organizationsBetween May and June 2016, the research team assessed the urinary concentrations of mercury, arsenic and cadmium in 824 people (230 of whom were under 12 years old), all living in Indigenous communities near oil exploration sites in remote, non-industrialized areas. The team took into account the distance between their homes and the nearest oil facility and also conducted personal interviews to collect data on their risk factors and lifestyles.The study was the result of an agreement between the Indigenous associations of the Corrientes, Pastaza, Tigre and Mara\u00f1\u00f3n river basins (ACODECOSPAT, FECONACOR, OPIKAFPE and FEDIQUEP, all of which belong to the Union of Amazonian Indigenous Peoples United in Defense of their Territories, or PUINAMUDT) and the Peruvian government.The aim of the scientific research was to respond to local people's concerns about the potential health effects of pollution associated with oil extraction. The research was supported by Indigenous associations and the Peruvian National Institute of Health. \"The active participation of Indigenous organizations in the study is one of its strengths,\" said Cristina O'Callaghan. \"The large sample size and the random sampling of families from various catchments with different characteristics are also noteworthy.\"      Higher than average levels of mercury, arsenic and cadmiumUrine analyses showed that a significant proportion of the children and adults in the study exceeded the established reference levels for mercury, arsenic and cadmium. These high levels of metals were associated with the water they consumed and bathed in, particularly in the case of mercury, which can be absorbed dermally.O'Callaghan said, \"Crude oil can contain mercury and other metals, and elevated levels have been reported in the environment and in aquatic organisms both around oil fields and in areas affected by spills.\"More mercury in people who bathed in river waterTwenty-five percent of children and 28% of adults had mercury levels above the reference value set by the Peruvian Ministry of Health (MINSA). Mercury levels were found to increase with age in adults and were higher in people living near the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River, where fish consumption is higher than in other river basins. Elevated levels of mercury in fish from the Amazon basin have been linked to oil pollution.However, previous studies in the same region have suggested that the main route of mercury exposure in the area is through dermal absorption of mercury in water. This is consistent with the results of the study published now, as mercury concentrations were higher in children and adults who bathed in river water compared to those who bathed in wells, and also higher in adults who consumed rainwater compared to those who drank water from public sources.More arsenic in children who drank well waterForty-eight percent of the child population and 23% of the adult population had arsenic levels above the reference value set by the Peruvian Ministry of Health. Arsenic levels decreased slightly with age in adults, tended to be higher in children who drank well water and, similar to mercury, were highest in people living around the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n.Elevated levels of arsenic of geological origin have been reported in aquifers in western Amazonia and relatively high concentrations have been reported in crude oil. However, the source of arsenic in the study area remains unknown.More cadmium in homes and gardens near oil spillsUrinary cadmium levels above the reference value were found in 2% of children and 13% of adults. Cadmium concentrations increased with age in adults and were higher in women. The highest levels were found in the Achuar people and in people living around Corrientes and Tigre, the two most oil-active basins of the four studied.Elevated cadmium levels were also associated with the proximity of homes or gardens to oil spills. Consumption of contaminated vegetables is a known route of cadmium exposure. Urinary cadmium levels were also associated with involvement in the clean-up of such spills in the six months prior to the study.Drinking water and food security for Indigenous peopleThe pattern of high concentrations for all metals observed in the study appears to be linked to pollution from human activities, particularly oil extraction. According to Manolis Kogevinas, ISGlobal researcher and one of the authors of the study, \"The detection of high levels of metals in a population living in a non-industrial environment is worrying because of the long-term health effects that exposure to metals can have.\"He said, \"Preventing these exposures, regularly monitoring water quality, providing safe drinking water and ensuring food security are a priority for the Indigenous populations living in these river basins.\" More information:Levels of arsenic, cadmium and mercury in urine of indigenous people living close to oil extraction areas in the Peruvian Amazon.

  "text": "The 200 million Europeans who live in coastal zones are already feeling the impact of global warming through extreme variations in sea level and flooding.          Many parts of Europe could suffer 10 times more coastal flooding by 2100, depending on the trajectory of greenhouse-gas emissions that cause climate change, according to the European Environment Agency.History lessonsFor major cities close to the shore, this is going to be a big issue,\" said Dr. Joana Freitas, an environmental historian at the University of Lisbon in Portugal.The predicted rise in sea levels has focused attention on the measures that can be taken to protect Europe's coastline. As the first natural line of defense against flooding and coastal erosion, sand dunes have an important role to play in sheltering these areas.But today's sand dunes don't provide as much protection as they once did.Looking at how people have interacted with nature can provide valuable insights into recent changes in the environment and humankind's role in causing them, according to Freitas.She is the lead researcher of the DUNES project, which is putting together a complete history of human-environment interactions in coastal areas worldwide.The project, which began in November 2018 and runs through April 2024, covers France, Portugal, the U.K., Brazil, Mozambique, North America and New Zealand.\"Humans have a long history of connecting with dunes,\" said Freitas.That history is marked by ups and downs. In the 17th to 18th centuries, dunes in Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Portugal were considered dangerous because the sand blown inland by the wind silted rivers and harmed farms.Tree trapsTo prevent this, coastal inhabitants planted marram grass\u2014Ammophila arenaria\u2014to trap the sands.Later, from the end of the 18th century, several countries in Europe supported the planting of trees on dunes to prevent the destruction of arable land and increase dunes' economic value by turning them into forested areas.Trees can grow well on stabilized dunes and become part of their ecosystem. And, in general, vegetation such as grasses, shrubs and bushes can help stabilize dunes and prevent their erosion as well as provide a home for plants and wildlife.But large-scale tree plantings carried out in the 19th century and early 20th century caused more damage than the inhabitants likely realized. For one, as these new forests often were monocultures of non-native species, they disrupted the existing ecosystems.Second, extensive tree planting\u2014along with the spread of urban areas, building of harbors and dams, dredging of navigation channels and construction of seawalls and low barriers known as groins\u2014caused profound changes in coastal areas.For example, they deeply affected the balance between sediment added to and removed from a coastal system's littoral zone, which is the part of a sea close to the shore. This activity reduced the amount of sand on some beaches, limiting their ability to act as a buffer and protect structures and buildings on the coast.      Wave power\"Dunes are keepers of sand, they are reservoirs,\" said Freitas. \"When there are bigger and stronger waves during storms, the sand is taken from the beach, which creates an underwater barrier, so the next waves will be blocked.\"Eventually, over weeks or months, more gentle waves gradually return the eroded sand from offshore to the beach. This fluctuating of the shoreline backwards and forwards over time is a normal coastal process that is hardly noticeable in normal times but can be dramatic during storms.Freitas is concerned that if the natural balance isn't maintained, beaches will eventually be destroyed and the coastal protection dunes provide will be lost.Olivier Burvingt, a researcher at the University of Bordeaux in France, is well aware of the potential impact of storms and sea level rises on coastal sand dunes.As part of the ERoDES project, Burvingt and colleagues are seeking to understand how dunes respond to and recover from extreme weather events along the Atlantic coast of Europe. The three-year project runs through August 2024.By using light detection and ranging, or LiDAR, laser technology, the ERoDES team can collect precise data from the air along several kilometers of dunes.\"Regional coastal monitoring programs across Europe provide us with data that were collected using aircraft that fly over dunes,\" said Burvingt. \"That way we can measure and study the topographical changes of the dune sediments with a vertical precision of up to 10 centimeters.\"Like Freitas and her team, ERoDES is also looking back in time and drawing on physical and digital archives and models to understand more about dunes' behavior now and in the future.Regional puzzlesThe vast amount of data collected by the project can provide insights into the difference in resilience of some of the most exposed coastal dunes along the Atlantic coast.For example, the team is studying the response and recovery rates of eight coastal dune areas ranging from north-western England to southwestern France in the 2011\u20132020 period.All the areas under study have been exposed to and eroded by massive storms in the Atlantic, particularly extreme weather experienced in the winter of 2013\u20132014.A puzzling element for the researchers is that, although exposed to the same storms, the dunes have responded differently and have all recovered at varying speeds. While some areas have returned to the same state they were in before the storms, others are still recovering or have lost even more sand.\"We're trying to understand why their response is different,\" said Burvingt.All eight sites have different environmental characteristics, including tides, climate, dune size, coastline shape and vegetation density.One of the main findings from the project so far is that the dunes with the steepest slopes were the ones to lose the most sand.Another is that the rate of recovery is mainly dependent on the amount of sediment available along the coastline. Being able accurately to assess these sediment budgets is key to anticipating the evolution of coastal dunes.At the project's end, these results will be shared with coastal authorities across Europe. Based on the characteristics of each region, officials can tailor a strategy to protect the dunes, restore the coasts and guard against future storms and flooding.New approachBoth ERoDES and DUNES advance a broad EU initiative to help cities and local authorities better understand the climate threat they face and how to react in time.But in doing so, the two projects take a new approach to adapting to global warming by avoiding a traditional focus on new technologies and methods that can prevent, or at least reduce, the impact of future flooding, drought, wildfires and other consequences of rising temperatures.Instead, ERoDES and DUNES move towards relying on steps that work with an ecosystem rather than introducing traditional human-made fixes such as seawalls, dams and dikes. Future dune restoration and protection are set to depend on planting native vegetation and re-introducing indigenous plant species\u2014actions that are kinder on the environment and relatively inexpensive.\"This simple and effective nature-based solution has been done by coastal populations for centuries in some European countries,\" said Freitas.As for the research itself, she stressed the benefits of its interdisciplinary nature.\"One of the most important contributions of DUNES is to show that transdisciplinary work between the humanities and the sciences is possible, rich and valuable and should be a path to follow more often in the future,\" Freitas said.Adapting to climate changeAccording to the latest data from the World Meteorological Organization, Europe is warming twice as fast as the world average.Adapting to climate change means taking action now to prepare for both the current effects of climate change and the future ones.The EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change focuses on supporting EU regions, cities and local authorities in their efforts to build resilience to the inevitable effects of a changing climate.With concrete targets for 2030, the EU Mission to Restore our Ocean and Waters will protect and restore aquatic ecosystems to support biodiversity and ensure native wildlife and plants have a home for years to come.Nature-based solutions are inspired by and supported by nature. They use nature's own resources\u2014clean air, water and soil\u2014in a smart way, to tackle environmental challenges while supporting biodiversity and providing environmental, social and economic benefits.Other projects that are implementing nature-based solutions to coastal erosion, including dune restoration, include REST-COAST and Interreg MANABAS.

We catch diseases and the kids keep falling sick,\" he added. \"There is no one to clean the filth.\"India at the end of April was projected to have overtaken China as the world's most populous country, according to the United Nations, with almost 1.43 billion people.Its urban population is predicted to explode in the coming decades, with over 270 million more people forecast to live in its cities by 2040.But of the 72 billion liters of sewage currently generated in urban centers every day, 45 billion liters\u2014enough to fill 18,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools\u2014aren't treated, according to government figures for 2020-21.India's sewerage system does not connect to about two-thirds of its urban homes, according to the National Faecal Sludge and Septage Management Alliance (NFSSM).Many of the sewage treatment plants in operation don't comply with standards\u2014including 26 out of Delhi's 35 facilities, according to media reports.Coupled with huge volumes of industrial effluent, the sewage is causing disease, polluting India's waterways, killing wildlife and seeping into groundwater.                Khalil Ahmad, a resident of New Delhi's Seelampur neighbourhood, gestures towards a sewage canal filled with garbage during a interview with AFP.             Ecologically deadAlthough India has made major progress in reducing child mortality, diarrhea\u2014caused mostly by contaminated water and food\u2014remains a leading killer.More than 55,000 children under five died of diarrhea across India in 2019, according to a study published last year in the scientific journal BMC Public Health.The Yamuna in Delhi is one of the world's filthiest rivers and is considered ecologically dead in places, although people still wash clothes and take ritual baths in it.It often billows with white foam, and facilities processing drinking water from the river for Delhi's 20 million people regularly shut down because of dangerous ammonia levels.Despite some bright spots, as well as efforts to plant more trees alongside rivers, the situation elsewhere is often no better in big cities including Mumbai and Chennai.In Bengaluru, massive Bellandur Lake has on occasion caught fire when methane, generated by bacteria feasting on sewage in the oxygen-depleted water, ignited.                A man walks over a floating barrier stopping waste from a sewage canal leading to New Delhi's Yamuna River, one of the filthiest in the world.             'Water crisis'Mridula Ramesh, author of a book about India's water woes who lives in a \"nearly\" net-zero-waste home, said properly treating sewage into useable water would help solve the crisis.According to the World Bank, India is one of the most \"water-stressed\" countries in the world, with plummeting water tables and increasingly erratic monsoon rains.Chennai nearly ran out of water briefly in 2019, and other cities may see similar calamities in the coming years due to excessive groundwater pumping and rainfall volatility.\"India is headed for a water crisis. Sewage can so easily be co-opted to fight that and help us to a very large extent solve the problem in our cities,\" Ramesh told AFP.This could be achieved with decentralized treatment plants partially funded by the private sector or non-governmental organizations, with some of the fully treated sewage reused or released into local lakes.\"India's water is so seasonal. Many cities in India get 50 rain days... but sewage is available every day because you go to the bathroom every day... It's such a powerful weapon,\" she said.For Khalil Ahmad, standing by the revolting open drain in Seelampur as flies buzz around, a solution can't come soon enough.\"Children keep falling sick... If they don't get treatment and medicine, the children will die,\" he told AFP.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Dead rivers, flaming lakes: India's sewage failure (2023, May 3)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-dead-rivers-flaming-lakes-india.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_squad": " a naturally occurring climate pattern typically associated with increased heat worldwide, as well as drought in some parts of the world",
  "text": "The United Nations warned Wednesday of a growing likelihood the weather phenomenon El Nino will develop in coming months, fuelling higher global temperatures and possibly new heat records.          The UN's World Meteorological Organization said it now estimated there was a 60-percent chance that El Nino would develop by the end of July, and an 80-percent chance it would do so by the end of September.\"This will change the weather and climate patterns worldwide,\" Wilfran Moufouma Okia, head of WMO's regional climate prediction services division, told reporters in Geneva.El Nino, which is a naturally occurring climate pattern typically associated with increased heat worldwide, as well as drought in some parts of the world and heavy rains elsewhere, last occurred in 2018-19.Since 2020 though, the world has been hit with an exceptionally long La Nina\u2014El Nino's cooling opposite\u2014which ended earlier this year, ceding way to the current neutral conditions.And yet, the UN has said the last eight years were the warmest ever recorded, despite La Nina's cooling effect stretching over nearly half that period.Without that weather phenomenon, the warming situation could have been even worse.Global heating spikes likelyLa Nina \"acted as a temporary brake on global temperature increase\", WMO chief Petteri Taalas said in a statement.Now, he said, \"the world should prepare for the development of El Nino.\"The expected arrival of the warming climate pattern, he said, \"will most likely lead to a new spike in global heating and increase the chance of breaking temperature records\".At this stage, there is no indication of the strength or duration of the looming El Nino.The last one was considered very weak, but the one before that, between 2014 and 2016, was considered among the strongest ever, with dire consequences.WMO pointed out that 2016 was \"the warmest year on record because of the 'double whammy' of a very powerful El Nino event and human-induced warming from greenhouse gases\".Since the El Nino effect on global temperatures usually plays out the year after it emerges, the impact will likely be most apparent in 2024, it said.\"We are expecting in the coming two years to have a serious increase in the global temperatures,\" Okia said.'More extreme weather'Taalas highlighted that the expected arrival of El Nino could have some positive effects, pointing out that it \"might bring respite from the drought in the Horn of Africa and other La Nina-related impacts\".But it \"could also trigger more extreme weather and climate events\" he said, stressing the need for effective early warning systems \"to keep people safe\".No two El Nino events are the same and their effects depend, in part, on the time of year, WMO said, adding that it and national meteorological services would be closely monitoring developments.The climate pattern occurs on average every two to seven years, and usually lasts nine to 12 months.It is typically associated with warming ocean surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.Increased rainfall is usually seen in parts of southern South America, the southern United States, the Horn of Africa and central Asia, while severe droughts can occur over Australia, Indonesia and parts of southern Asia.During summer in the northern hemisphere, El Nino's warm water can also fuel hurricanes in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, while hindering hurricane formations in the Atlantic Basin, WMO said.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:World should prepare for El Nino, new record temperatures: UN (2023, May 3)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-world-el-nino-temperatures.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "answer_race": " Forest ditches release less methane than previously estimated.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the study that showed that methane emissions are particularly low in moss-covered ditches?",
  "answer_squad": " Natural Resources Institute Finland",
  "text": "According to a study by the Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke), the University of Tampere and the University of Helsinki, ditches in forestry-drained peatlands release less methane into the atmosphere than what has previously been estimated. The study showed that methane emissions are particularly low in moss-covered ditches. The proportion of such ditches from all forest ditches is increasing, as ditch network maintenance will decrease when the granted forestry subsidies end.          Some 5.9 million hectares of Finnish peatlands have been drained for forestry, accounting for roughly 17% of Finland's area. While drainage has caused carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions, it has also significantly reduced methane emissions from the peat soil. In place of soil, ditches have, however, become significant sources of methane emissions, which is accounted in the national greenhouse gas inventory as part of the land use sector.From Tier 1 emission factors to more advanced emission estimatesThe current estimate of methane emissions of ditches from Finland's forestry-drained peatlands presented in the greenhouse gas inventory is based on the Tier 1 emission factor of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). However, the studies used as the basis for Tier 1 emission factors represent Finnish conditions poorly, as only two of the 11 study areas are located in Finland. This is why the dataset had to be expanded significantly.\"We conducted chamber measurements for methane emissions and collected previous measurement data regarding different types of ditches from a total of 21 study areas in Finland,\" says Antti Rissanen, Academy Research Fellow at the University of Tampere.Furthermore, the Tier 1 emission factor does not address that different types of ditches may have different levels of methane emissions.\"Based on previous studies, we could make the assumption that methane emissions from ditches depend on the type of ditch and especially on the type of vegetation in the ditch,\" says Rissanen.Low emissions from moss-covered ditchesThe study showed that moss-covered ditches generate very low methane emissions, being only one eighth of emissions from moss-free water-covered ditches and Tier 1 emissions. Therefore, the Tier 1 emission factor significantly overestimates methane emissions from moss-covered ditches. These results can probably be explained by microbial activity.\"Methanotrophs, methane-consuming bacteria, live in and on mosses, which consume methane before it is released into the atmosphere. It is also possible that the organic compounds excreted by mosses restrain the activity of methanogenic microbes that generate methane,\" says Rissanen.Methane emissions from Finland's forest ditches are lower than previously estimatedThe study also estimated the area of ditches of forestry-drained peatlands in Finland. In addition, the percentage of both moss-covered and moss-free ditches was estimated.\"We estimated that two thirds of all ditches are moss-covered and only one third are moss-free. The high percentage of moss-covered ditches can probably be explained by the significant decrease in ditch network maintenance in recent years,\" says Leena Stenberg, Research Scientist at Luke.As a result of the low emissions and high percentage of moss-covered ditches, the study's results of methane emissions from ditches of forestry-drained peatlands were roughly 8,600 tons of methane per year, being as much as 63% lower than in the current greenhouse gas inventory (approximately 23,200 tons). Converted into the commonly used unit, carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq), the new emission value is roughly 0.4 million tons of CO2eq lower than the previous one.The research group proposes that the national emission factors based on the results be used in the greenhouse gas inventory, as they represent emissions from Finland's forest ditches better than the Tier 1 emission factors.The work is published in the journal Frontiers in Environmental Science.

  "answer_squad": " Flipflopi",
  "text": "Washing clothes releases microfibers, which can be synthetic (plastic) and non-synthetic, but little is understood about the environmental impact. To better understand this, researchers teamed up with the Flipflopi project, an initiative which uses the world's first recycled plastic sailing dhow, a handmade boat constructed from materials found on African beaches, including 30,000 discarded flip flops. To date, the seven-ton boat has received more than 90,000 kg of plastics from the world's oceans.          Researchers examined over 2400 microfibers in water samples taken from 37 sites along the Kenyan and Tanzanian coastlines. Over half of the samples contained natural microfibers from wool, cotton, silk, vegetables and minerals.Dr. Matteo Gallidabino, Lecturer in Forensic Chemistry at the Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, said, \"The study shows the presence of textile fibers in every sample collected, from a minimum of about one fiber per liter up to a maximum of about 60 fibers per liter. These are considerable numbers.\"\"Indeed, if we multiply these values for the total volume of water in our oceans, we easily realize that the level of maritime pollution due to the garment industry is potentially huge, even after the necessary corrections to take into account depth and location.\"\"This is a kind of pollution that everybody irremediably contributes to, willing or not. It is not something that can be avoided easily. We all need to use garments in our daily life and some of the textile fibers they are made of can find their way into the environment, meaning that each of us is an integral part of the pollution chain by simply living our life,\" says Dr. Matteo Gallidabino.The wastewater from washing machines and hand washing clothes have also contributed to the presence of microfibers into the ocean. Washing machines play a part but it has been estimated that less than a quarter of the households in Kenya use these, and many instead wash clothes by hand, dumping the wastewater onto the ground. What isn't absorbed by the soil runs off into the water, polluting the ocean.Dr. Matteo Gallidabino added, \"We need to increase awareness on the environmental impact of the textile industry. Even if the clothes we wear are composed by natural materials, such as cotton or wool, some of the textile fibers they are made of can find their way into the environment and, potentially, accumulate into living organisms. These may be very harmful and have significant effects on the biodiversity.\"The study found that many of these fibers are in colorful shades like red and green, which to fish, appear as the algae found on the coast of Kenya. As these microfibers can carry pathogens, the presence of these fibers in the ocean pose an extra hazard to fish.\"Textile fibers, commonly referred to as microfibers, and their prevalence in the environment have been studied by forensic scientists for decades. However, the majority of recent environmental studies have overlooked that knowledge and focused only on the characterization of microplastic fibers. This has led to inaccurate microfiber data and much misunderstanding in the literature, culminating in a general underestimation of the threat posed by natural fibers,\" says Dr. Kelly Sheridan, Assistant Professor of Forensic Science at Northumbria University.The work is published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution.

  "text": "As American states such as California grapple with harsher and more frequent droughts, the Midwest is touting its ample water supplies to spur economic growth.          Chicago has just signed a contract valued at $1 billion to sell its water elsewhere\u2014the first such deal in 40 years\u2014and the city expects more to come. Illinois is also launching a federally-funded plan to expand its $17 billion \"Blue Economy\" to lure companies from water-intensive chip manufacturers to climate-tech startups.The Great Lakes, which account for more than 80% of North America's surface fresh water supplies, are increasingly becoming a key selling point. As President Joe Biden pushes advanced manufacturing and environmentally-friendly infrastructure, the Midwest is poised for a much-needed economic boost.\"We have this water that is critical,\" said Alaina Harkness, executive director of Current, the nonprofit water innovation hub behind the plan. It's important not just for the region's climate and residents, but it's also a critical supply-chain component for manufacturing, food and beverage companies, data-processing and storage centers and chipmakers, she added. \"Not having access to it is a risk for businesses.\"Midwest cities such as Chicago have struggled with the decline in traditional manufacturing over the decades as factories moved offshore for cheaper labor and resources. Biden now wants to bring back advanced industrial and infrastructure investment\u2014with a focus on clean energy as well as $55 billion to improve drinking water and wastewater systems.As a result, Illinois aims to replace its rust belt label with a clean belt economy by 2030, according to the Current report. The region has the vast amounts of water and space needed for businesses from wind farms to chip manufacturing.\"A lot of industries\u2014be that electric vehicles or food, life sciences\u2014they have a lot of water needs,\" said Michael Fassnacht, head of World Business Chicago and the city's chief marketing officer. \"Corporations, as well, will look at climate resilience and water safety, so being next to water is a massive, massive factor.\"      Cities with direct access to fresh water are already looking to capitalize. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot last week signed a 100-year deal to sell water to Joliet, about 50 miles inland, and its suburbs. This will make it the city's second-biggest water buyer when supplies start in 2030. The deal comes after Chicago lost some customers in recent years following price increases, said Jennie Bennett, the city's chief financial officer.\"We've put the Chicago water system back in a growth position through the Joliet transaction in a really big way,\" Bennett said in a recent interview. \"We know that having high-quality, low-cost water is very important to a lot of industries.\"Chicago can offer water for less than what cities such as Detroit, New York, Houston, Philadelphia and Los Angeles can. And it's just a fraction of the price in San Francisco, according to data from the Windy City's Department of Water Management.To be sure, the Midwest has yet to see a huge influx of businesses due to its ample water supplies. Companies also take into account other factors when choosing to relocate, but questions about water and energy supplies have increased in recent years, said Fassnacht, whose job includes luring businesses to Chicago.There are also concerns about how to tap water as a tool for economic development without depleting the resource. Solving that issue could also be an opportunity for companies like Milwaukee-based Rockwell Automation. The company is developing solutions including using artificial intelligence to reduce the amount of energy used in water treatment.\"All of our customers are talking about it across industries,\" said Damon Sepe, a business development manager for Rockwell. \"It's real, they have goals by 2030, 2050 that they need to hit, and our role is helping them.\"Startups are also taking notice. The opportunity was attractive enough that Seyi Fabode decided to start Varuna four years ago, after leaving the power sector. They company has offices in Chicago and Austin and tracks water-related risks such as the potential for lead contamination or bursting pipes.Most of the US's water system was built in the 1970s and 1980s. About 14% to 18% of treated potable water in the country is lost through leaks, according to a McKinsey study.\"Water was becoming the next big thing,\" Fabode said. \"Austin had a water problem, Flint had a water problem, and I felt there was an opportunity to use my expertise.\"    2023 Bloomberg L.P.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the environmental advocacy organization that holds volunteer clean up events?",
  "answer_squad": " Get Outdoors Nevada",
  "text": "When environmental advocacy organization Get Outdoors Nevada holds volunteer clean up events at public lands around the valley, they typically bring buckets.          When they clean up Frenchman Mountain\u2014they bring dumpsters.The east Las Vegas landmark has long been plagued by illegal dumping, tarnishing pristine areas of outdoor recreation enjoyed by Sunrise Manor residents and visitors alike.A battle to keep Frenchman Mountain free from trash is gaining momentum after local advocates joined forces to potentially make the area a national monument.Since Get Outdoors Nevada began holding clean up events in 2016, approximately 15,000 pounds of trash have been collected by the organization at Frenchman. Two cleanup events at Frenchman held last year netted about 6,000 pounds of trash alone.\"The evidence abounds of folks who have been firing firearms, and using this area for target practice; that has created in, over a large swath of this area, huge amounts of glass and trash debris,\" Rachel Bergren, executive director for Get Outdoors Nevada, said.Volunteers often spend hours clean up everything from tiny shards of glass to tires to construction debris, Bergren said.Hence, the dumpsters.But the problem of dumping and vandalism in the area isn't new. Steve Rowland, a geology professor at UNLV who has spent his career studying Frenchman Mountain's unique rock formation, has worked to clean up the area since the early 1990s.Rowland helped form the advocacy group Citizens for Active Management of French & Sunrise Mountain Area, or CAM, to organize mountain clean ups and educate the public on the area's geological significance. The group worked with BLM to build educational signs near the mountain for visitors in early 1995, but not long after they were installed, vandals destroyed them.Undeterred, Rowland said he has refusesd to let the area decay into a roadside trash dump.\"We've been trying to get that area cleaned up for a long time,\" Rowland said. \"We would eventually like to have a higher level of management protection by the BLM, or whatever agency, to make sure that people don't feel like it's an OK place to go out and just throw their beer bottles around and leave trash.\"Bergren, Rowland and Clark County Commissioner Segerblom, who represents District E which oversees the East Side, are part of a growing local coalition of Las Vegas residents who hope to see the area receive national monument designation, just as Avi Kwa Ame received its designation in March, as part of a long-term solution to for a cleaner Frenchman Mountain.      Just as Red Rock Canyon received additional management resources by becoming a national conservation area in 1990, the Frenchman Mountain area could also see increased resources with national monument status, Bergren said.\"It's not an apples to apples comparison, but that potential certainly exists at Frenchman Mountain,\" she said.Some protection does already exist for the area, which is designated as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern to protect the rare Las Vegas bear poppy, a state-designated endangered plant, according to Stephen Leslie, assistant field manager at BLM's Las Vegas Field Office.The BLM alone lacks the authority to change the designation of the land without an act of Congress or through presidential proclamation, he said.\"It is unfortunate that we do see such a high amount of dumping and graffiti and other types of incidents,\" Leslie said. \"I think the more people understand about the area, the more invested in it they would become.\"The coalition states on the monument campaign's website that they believe the ACEC designation is not doing enough to bring adequate resources and oversight for the area.Right now, the movement to make Frenchman Mountain a national monument is still in early stages, Bergren and Rowland said. As a grassroots movement, advocates have focused primarily on educating the public about the need for increased protection and resources in the area, and getting members of the public to sign a petition to support making the area the East Las Vegas National Monument.\"There's so many valuable characteristics of this space that we think put it on the same playing field as something like Avi Kwa Ame,\" Bergren said. \"It's a much smaller area\u2014but there are many similarities because of all the resources and the values that are there.\"The Great Unconformity rock formation, for example, brings international geologists to Las Vegas who want to better understand the unique, abnormal rock layers there that are only visible in Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon, Rowland said.\"It's a little embarrassing to take them to a world-class geological site, and have to step over broken glass and beer cans and old bed springs,\" Rowland said.Segerblom said his office is working closely with senators, congresspeople, and the Biden administration to make the national monument a reality\u2014especially to give added protection to The Great Unconformity.\"That's going to be another part of the push we're trying to do and really make it a place where tourists and locals can go and enjoy it,\" Segerblom said. \"The view up there is just phenomenal.\"Getting an area national monument designation isn't something that will happen overnight. Avi Kwa Ame was 20 years in the making before receiving its status, and came after tribal groups and environmental activists spearheaded a public awareness campaign in 2021.But, Segerblom said more immediate solutions to the trash problem are in the works.Segerblom recently spearheaded the installation of concrete barriers along Los Feliz Street between Washington Avenue and Bonanza Road to deter would-be trash dumpers and off-roaders from entering the desert behind residential communities. Soon, he hopes to add cameras to some of the East Side's dead-end streets to record illegal activities near Frenchman.\"Hopefully, there's a barrier there, they won't just get out and carry their mattresses over,\" Segerblom said.He also plans to push for a Neighborhood Services Department in his next term. The department will focus on being a one-stop-shop that residents can contact to report illegal dumping, among other community issues that need to be resolved that would coordinate with BLM and the county.In the meantime, members of the public can help support public lands through volunteer efforts and by signing the petition to support the designation on eastlasvegasmonument.org. You can also call BLM's dispatch center at 702-293-8998 to report dumping.Although there are no scheduled clean ups at Frenchman Mountain yet, Get Outdoors Nevada is planning to organize a mass clean up of the area in the fall, Bergren said.\"It's a really beautiful area, and we think it deserves to be cared for and have attention brought to it,\" she said. \"Whatever we can do to support and to raise awareness and get the community involved is something that we're really committed to.\"    2023 Las Vegas Review-Journal.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "text": "California's remarkably wet winter may be several weeks behind us, but flooding remains a significant threat as the majority of the state's massive snowpack has yet to melt, and more snow is forecast for this week.          \"This melt really is still just getting started,\" said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with UCLA. \"I know that's hard to believe, but we're getting into May and the peak is probably yet to come.\"A Department of Water Resources crew conducted its fifth snow survey of the year Monday and determined that statewide snowpack was 254% of normal for the date, with the equivalent of 49.2 inches of water contained in the snow.The survey, conducted at Phillips Station near south Lake Tahoe, marked the first time there was measurable snow on May 1 at Phillips Station since 2020. That year, there was only 1.5 inches of snow on the ground, with a snow water equivalent of 0.5 inches.\"No matter how you look at the data, only a handful of years in the historical record compare to this year's results,\" said Sean de Guzman, DWR's manager of snow surveys. Last month, 2023 joined 1952, 1969 and 1983 as the only years with snowpack above 200% on April 1, the date when it is typically at its deepest.Snowpack in the southern Sierra Nevada remains even higher, measuring 326% of average on Monday, with 51.2 inches of snow water equivalent.The bounty has eased searing drought conditions and provided a significant boost to California's water supplies, but officials continued to underscore the flood risk in the San Joaquin Valley, which sits like a bowl at the base of the southern Sierra and has already experienced major inundations this year.In fact, despite a major warm-up at the end of the month, temperatures in April were generally cooler than average, and only about 12 inches of the snow water equivalent melted regionally and statewide. That's left most of it poised to flow downhill through the summer.\"The significant majority of what was up there at its peak is still there, even as we head into May, even in the wake of major heat waves,\" Swain said.A region of particular concern is the Tulare Lake Basin, where a series of atmospheric rivers have refilled once-dry Tulare Lake. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who visited the area last week amid a backdrop of stagnant water and flooded farms, said runoff could continue to flow into the area for the next 16 weeks.      Inflows into the basin will likely peak around late May or early June, Swain said. An incoming cold storm, which is expected to deliver more rain and snow to the southern Sierra and surrounding foothills this week, may only serve to delay the peak of the melt further into summer.In parts of the Tulare and San Joaquin basins, \"things will get worse still before they get better,\" he said.Indeed, officials with the DWR and other agencies are continuing to prepare for runoff and flooding. The joint state-federal Flood Operations Center has provided more than 1.4 million sandbags, 1 million square feet of plastic sheeting and 9,000 feet of \"muscle wall\" barriers across the state since January and is ready to deploy more resources as needed, officials said.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\u2014which owns and operates the Tulare basin's four major dams at Lake Success, Lake Isabella, Pine Flat and Lake Kaweah\u2014is also releasing water to ensure there is room to absorb runoff from the snow. The reservoirs are at 74%, 62%, 43% and 22% capacity, respectively.However, state and federal officials are asking for continued vigilance as runoff forecasts remain high. Inflows in the Tulare Lake area range from 269% to 443% of average through July, state data show.\"The snowpack will not disappear in one week or one month but will lead to sustained high flows across the San Joaquin and Tulare Basins over the next several months, and this data will help us inform water managers and ultimately help protect communities in these regions,\" DWR director Karla Nemeth said in a statement following Monday's snow survey.Swain similarly said that much of the threat may come from cumulative high flows\u2014as opposed to individual bursts of extreme flows\u2014which can contribute to escalating problems in the San Joaquin Valley.\"Things are getting more and more saturated and there's less and less places for that water to go in the Tulare Lake Basin and surrounding areas,\" he said.Despite the flood risk, the remarkable snowpack has been a boon for water supplies and drought conditions in California. Less than 8% of the state is now classified as being in drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Just three months ago, 90% of the state was in drought, and about 10% was abnormally dry.What's more, the DWR last month announced that for the first time since 2006, it will allocate 100% of requested supplies from the State Water Project\u2014a system of canals, reservoirs and dams that supplies water to 29 agencies and about 27 million Californians. Last year's allocation was just 5%.The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which provides critical farming irrigation and water supplies in the state, also announced a 100% allocation for most regions.With more rain and snow on the horizon, there remains a degree of uncertainty about the precise timing and location of snowmelt and flooding this season. Forecasts for significant flooding along the Merced River inside Yosemite National Park largely failed to manifest this weekend, and park officials reopened the area early.And while some have already taken rafts to the state's high, fast, rivers, officials have asked residents to continue to exercise caution, including leaving sandbags and other flood-fighting items in place in the Tulare Lake area.Snowmelt-driven high flows in rivers could occur \"well into July\" in some watersheds, especially in the southern Sierra, DWR officials wrote in a post about the snow survey on Facebook.\"It is crucial that Californians continue paying attention to their local county emergency officials and warnings in the coming months as snowmelt-driven flood concerns this year will be a marathon, not a sprint,\" the agency said.    2023 Los Angeles Times.

  "text": "Cold spells often bring climate change deniers out in force on social media, with hashtags like #ClimateHoax and #ClimateScam. Former President Donald Trump often chimes in, repeatedly claiming that each cold snap disproves the existence of global warming.          From a scientific standpoint, these claims of disproof are absurd. Fluctuations in the weather don't refute clear long-term trends in the climate.Yet many people believe these claims, and the political result has been reduced willingness to take action to mitigate climate change.Why are so many people susceptible to this type of disinformation? My field, psychology, can help explain\u2014and help people avoid being misled.The allure of black-and-white thinkingClose examination of the arguments made by climate change deniers reveals the same mistake made over and over again. That mistake is the cognitive error known as black-and-white thinking, also called dichotomous and all-or-none thinking. As I explain in my book \"Finding Goldilocks,\" black-and-white thinking is a source of dysfunction in mental health, relationships\u2014and politics.People are often susceptible to it because in many areas of life, dichotomous thinking does something helpful: It simplifies the world.Binaries are easy to handle because there are only two possibilities to consider. When people face a spectrum of possibilities and nuance, they have to exert more mental effort. But when that spectrum is polarized into pairs of opposites, choices are clear and dramatic.This mental labor-saving device is practical in many everyday situations, but it is a poor tool for understanding complicated realities\u2014and the climate is complicated.Sometimes, people divide the spectrum in asymmetric ways, with one side much larger than the other. For example, perfectionists often categorize their work as either perfect or unsatisfactory, so even good and very good outcomes are lumped together with poor ones in the unsatisfactory category. In dichotomous thinking like this, a single exception can tip a person's view to one side. It's like a pass/fail grading system in which 100% earns a pass and everything else gets an F.Sen. James Inhofe brought a snowball to the Senate floor in February 2015 to argue that because it was cold enough to snow in Washington, D.C., climate change wasn\u2019t real. That year became the hottest on record and has since been surpassed.With a grading system like this, it's not surprising that opponents of climate action have found ways to reject global warming research, despite the overwhelming evidence.Here's how they do it:      The all-or-nothing problemClimate change deniers simplify the spectrum of possible scientific consensus into two categories: 100% agreement or no consensus at all. If it's not one, it's the other.A 2021 review of thousands of climate science papers and conference proceedings concluded that over 99% of studies have found that burning fossil fuels warms the planet. That's not good enough for some skeptics. If they find one contrarian scientist somewhere, they categorize the idea of human-caused global warming as controversial and conclude that there is no basis for action.Powerful economic interests are at work here: The fossil fuel industry has funded disinformation campaigns for years to create this kind of doubt about climate change, despite knowing that their products cause it and the consequences. Members of Congress have used that disinformation to block or weaken federal policies that could slow climate change.Expecting a straight line in a variable worldIn another example of black-and-white thinking, deniers argue that if global temperatures are not increasing at a perfectly consistent rate, there is no such thing as global warming.However, complex variables never change in a uniform way; they wiggle up and down in the short term even when exhibiting long-term trends. Most business data, such as revenues, profits and stock prices, do this too, with short-term fluctuations contained in long-term trends.Mistaking a cold snap for disproof of climate change is like mistaking a bad month for Apple stock for proof that Apple isn't a good long-term investment. This error results from homing in on a tiny slice of the graph and ignoring the rest.                Influences on global temperature over time. Credit: 4th National Climate Assessment             Failing to examine the gray areaClimate change deniers also mistakenly cite correlations below 100% as evidence against human-caused global warming. They triumphantly point out that sunspots and volcanic eruptions also affect the climate, even though evidence shows both have very little influence on long-term temperature rise in comparison to greenhouse gas emissions.In essence, deniers argue that if fossil fuel burning is not all-important, it's unimportant. They miss the gray area in between: Greenhouse gases are indeed just one factor warming the planet, but they're the most important one and the factor humans can influence.'The climate has always been changing'\u2014but not like thisAs increases in global temperatures have become obvious, some climate change skeptics have switched from denying them to reframing them.Their oft-repeated line, \"The climate has always been changing,\" typically delivered with an air of patient wisdom, is based on a striking lack of knowledge about the evidence from climate research.Their reasoning is based on an invalid binary: Either the climate is changing or it's not, and since it's always been changing, there is nothing new here and no cause for concern.However, the current warming is on par with nothing humans have ever seen, and intense warming events in the distant past were planetwide disasters that caused massive extinctions\u2014something we do not want to repeat.As humanity faces the challenge of global warming, we need to use all our cognitive resources. Recognizing the thinking error at the root of climate change denial could disarm objections to climate research and make science the basis of our efforts to preserve a hospitable environment for our future.

On Monday, parishioners in the southern city of Jaen held a procession carrying aloft a statute of Christ called \"El Abuelo\" to pray for rain for the first time since 1949.Thousands attended the procession as experts say parts of Spain are the driest in a thousand years, with drought depleting reservoirs to half their normal capacity, figures show.\"We are in the midst of a persistent drought and the aim of this procession is to invoke the Lord to help us and save us,\" Ricardo Cobos, a member of the \"El Abuelo\" brotherhood, told AFP.On April 25, Spain asked the European Union for emergency funds to help the country's farmers grapple with a severe drought threatening crops.Two days later, mainland Spain recorded its hottest temperature ever for April, hitting 38.8 degrees Celsius (101.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in Cordoba, preliminary data showed.Water reservoirs are at half their capacity nationally and the COAG farmers' union says 60 percent of farmland is \"suffocating\" from lack of rainfall.Spain is the world's biggest exporter of olive oil and a key source of Europe's fruit and vegetables.\"We are very dependent on olive trees and the cultivation of oil, therefore when the land stops receiving water it is an economic catastrophe,\" said Cobos.Last year, Spain experienced its hottest year since records began, with UN figures suggesting nearly 75 percent of its land is susceptible to desertification due to climate change.Back in Jaen, eyes are on the sky. \"I have come to see the Lord and I have great faith that he will give us water\", said Antonia Contreras, who came to follow the procession from a neighboring town.    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Historic drought sees Spaniards pray for rain (2023, May 2)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-historic-drought-spaniards-pray.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "question_squad": " What is the first thing a good parent does?",
  "answer_squad": " feed their child",
  "text": "What makes a good parent? Most would say a good parent loves and nurtures their child with the ultimate aim of helping them flourish\u2014now and into the future. A good parent will feed their child, give them space to play and time to use their imagination, make sure they get an education and medical care, listen to their troubles, and teach them to one day be autonomous adults.          However, does being a good parent involve anything more than this?In her book, Parenting on Earth, philosopher and mother Elizabeth Cripps argues that to do right by their kids, parents must also attempt to do something about the problems caused by climate change.Many affluent parents, Cripps says, make two assumptions. The first is that their children will grow up (and grow old) avoiding environmental disasters. They will not experience starvation, famines, and wars over natural resources. Their future will be safe. The air they breathe will be clear, and the water they drink will be clean.The second assumption is that broader institutions\u2014such as governments and the World Health Organization\u2014will take care of these issues. Both assumptions, she argues, are wrong.Regarding the first assumption, consider the Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to avoid catastrophic climate change by preventing the world from warming by 2\u2103 from pre-industrial levels. Unfortunately, we are not on track to do this.Failing to achieve this aim, will cause tens of millions of deaths in the 21st century and an unquantifiable amount of suffering that does not result in death. Heat extremes that used only to happen every 50 years will occur every three. The number of people living in poverty will significantly increase as fundamental human rights to food, water, shelter and security are compromised. Every child on Earth will suffer at least one climate-related hazard, in their lifetime.Put simply, Cripps points out, future generations\u2014the very people that parents bring into the world\u2014may not have the same opportunities to flourish as many of us have had.Regarding the second assumption, the broader institutions we rely on are not doing enough to mitigate climate change. In a better-organized and just world, governments and international bodies would prevent climate-related problems on our behalf. The fact they are not, though, has ramifications for parents. Indeed, Cripps explains that the world's collective failure to adequately address climate change alters \"the rules of the parenting game\".Imagine, for instance, your child scooting down a road with a giant hole in the pavement. Even though it's the council's job to fill in this hole or fence it off, you would not sit back and let your child crash into it while claiming it was someone else's job to fix it. You are obligated to step in and attempt to keep your child safe.The same, argues Cripps, goes for climate change. Even though it should be someone else's responsibility to address it, protecting one's child ultimately falls to the parent. To do right by their kids, therefore, parents must also attempt to do something about climate change.Being a good parent means being a good ancestor who fights for the Earth their descendants will inherit. It may become impossible to help your kids flourish without doing so. Climate change threatens their health, livelihoods and human rights.Cripps even goes so far as to say that not trying to protect their future via addressing climate change makes a mockery of all the other things parents do to keep their children safe. It is equivalent to reading them a bedtime story while the house burns down.      Three climate change duties for parentsAccording to Cripps, joining the fight against climate change involves at least three things.First, parents must make lifestyle changes that minimize their family's contribution to climate change: doing things like eating less meat, driving less, flying less, and being more mindful of how much stuff we buy.These small-scale actions might feel fruitless, but, as Cripps explains, how we live mustn't feed into the global climate change crisis. Otherwise, we would be fanning the flames of the burning house. Lifestyle changes can also get corporations, governments, and our peers to pay attention.Secondly, Cripps says parents have a duty to raise their children as good ecological citizens aware of global climate injustices. This duty is particularly pertinent for families in affluent countries who have benefited from centuries of environmental exploitation. When parents in famine-plagued The Gambia cannot feed their kids, and many of us in the UK (where Cripps is writing from) or Australia (where I am writing from) have plenty of food to spare, there is a climate injustice at play.We are rich on the back of colonization that has stripped people of the wealth that could (and should) have been theirs. We use a disproportionate amount of natural resources that others have to pay the price for. This is deeply unjust and children should grow up to be better global and ecological citizens than we have been. Climate action should involve climate justice.Thirdly, and most importantly for Cripps, parents should become climate activists. When governments and corporations fail us in climate action, parents should campaign for and demand better collective action from the institutions and structures in society that can make significant differences.Doing so could involve anything from advocating for legislation that switches away from fossil fuels, changing to banks and superannuation that invest in renewable energy, attending protests, or signing petitions.It could also include joining collective movements campaigning to make it easier for people to live \"greener\"\u2014for instance, movements to improve public transport so it's easier to live car-free or to reduce plastic packaging.Parents cannot make large-scale differences on their own. But by joining groups trying to promote change and campaigning for more action by governments and other institutions, she argues they can do right by their kids.Cripps does not claim that it will be possible to do this all the time. (Climate action needs to be balanced against other duties involved in raising a child.) It may seem futile at times. But, if parents do nothing, they fail their children.The 'hardest question'This book is an important read for any parent. It's challenging and deeply confronting. Yet it's also full of hope for a future that could occur if enough work is done to make it happen. Cripps is not judging parents, talking down to them, or making them feel guilty.Instead, as an ethicist and a mother of two girls, she brings her professional expertise into a topic of deep personal concern. She is worried about her (and other) children's future in a vulnerable world that also includes pandemics, extreme poverty, unjust and racist institutions. She is essentially saying to other parents:\"I see you; this is a very stressful situation; here's some help on how we can best raise our children under the circumstances.\"In her Note to Readers, she says this book is also for those who are considering having kids. There is an interesting chapter on what she calls \"the hardest question\"\u2014that is, should we become parents at all, at least biological parents? As Cripps acknowledges, this is an essential question that precedes any others about how to parent. She says that we should be able to have kids\u2014it can be a uniquely valuable life experience\u2014and try to build a better future for them, but there are good moral reasons to think carefully about the issue.For instance, she explains that bringing a new person into the world in a heavily polluting country creates another person with a high carbon footprint. There are also children already alive today without parents who will suffer from the harms of climate change. Therefore, people without a strong desire to be a biological parent could perhaps seek to adopt instead.Nevertheless, there could have been more space dedicated to this decision. Indeed, as someone who does not have children and is considering whether it is ethical to become a parent in a time of climate change, it is a live question I'd have liked to read more on.Parenting on Earth reads as much more relevant to those who have already become parents. To that end, while everyone can gain valuable insights and become better ecological citizens by reading it, parents concerned with climate change should put it at the top of their must-read list.

  "text": "Germany called Tuesday for governments around the world to work on setting an ambitious target for renewable energy that would \"ring in the end of the fossil fuel age\" and help prevent dangerous global warming.          Speaking at the start of a two-day meeting in Berlin attended by dozens of top climate envoys, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the world needs to sharply cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).\"But we also know that not all countries are prepared to do so,\" she said. \"That is why I want to open the debate (...) on whether we should and can reach a target on renewables at the next climate conference.\"Baerbock's proposal flips the script on a previous push to set a deadline for phasing out all fossil fuels, which faced stiff resistance from major oil and gas exporting nations. They instead back the idea of capturing planet-warming emissions as a way to reducing greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Experts say such technologies, known as carbon capture and storage, are aren't proven at scale and could require huge investments at the expense of cheaper alternatives such as solar and wind power.Addressing officials from about 40 countries attending the annual Petersberg Climate Dialogue in the German capital, Baerbock said that renewables such as solar and wind power are already the most cost-effective form of generating energy in most places around the world.

He placed particular emphasis on the word \"emissions\" as he spoke.      \"We know that the energies used today will continue to be part of the global energy mix for the foreseeable future,\" he added. \"As such, we will work with the world to decarbonize the current energy system while we build a new one, capable of transitioning even the most heavy-emitting industries.\"                German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock speaks during the 14th Petersberg Climate Dialogue at the Federal Foreign Office in Berlin, Tuesday May 2, 2023.

Environmental campaigners are more critical, however, pointing out that the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. is expanding production, helping make the UAE one of the world's top 10 oil producers.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an end to all fossil fuel use, which is blamed for the majority of global warming that has occurred since the start of the industrial era, warning that otherwise the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) may be missed. But so far only coal has been put on notice, with a commitment by nations two years ago to \"phase down\" its use.                Cars and trucks queue on a highway after an accident in Frankfurt, Germany, April 26, 2023.

  "text": "In the afternoon hours of March 22, 2021, as women attended to chores and children played in dusty streets, a fire erupted at Kutupalong Balukhali in the Cox's Bazar region of Bangladesh, the largest refugee camp in the world.          Aided by wind, parched conditions and an abundant fuel source\u2014the bamboo and plastic tarp composing thousands of densely packed shelters across the camp's hilly terrain\u2014the fire ripped swiftly through makeshift homes, warehouses, medical facilities and mosques. Within two hours, it had engulfed more than 4 million square feet of the asylum for nearly 1 million Rohingya refugees who fled ethnic persecution in neighboring Myanmar.As the fire marched south, hundreds of gas cylinders used for cooking burst like small bombs. Residents poured into the camp's narrow streets, first to fight the fire\u2014then to flee, frantically searching for family members or doubling back for their meager belongings, only to be caught in the chaotic flood of evacuees escaping the rapidly advancing flames, heat and thick smoke.The fire burned for seven hours, scorched over 160 acres, killed 15 people and displaced another 45,000. According to emergency responders on the scene, the magnitude of the fire, lack of water and narrow roads hampered their efforts; the fire was only controlled once there was nothing left to burn.The circumstances that displace refugees\u2014from violence and persecution to war and increasingly, the impacts of climate change\u2014are nothing short of traumatic. According to the United Nations' Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 103 million people have been forcibly displaced worldwide, more than the entire population of Germany. Of that, 32.5 million become refugees. Those who flee to humanitarian camps bear the scars of their arduous journeys and circumstance, as well as the trauma of leaving behind their homes, possessions and communities.While reports of fires in humanitarian settlements briefly graze global news feeds, no one seems to be running a tally. These types of fires are poorly tracked and even more poorly understood, setting the stage for a repeating history with no end in sight, said Danielle Antonellis, a fire protection engineer who's founder and executive director of Kindling, a nonprofit that supports and inspires fire safety in vulnerable communities around the world.\"When you think about these people who have been displaced and have nothing, that are vulnerable in so many ways,\" Antonellis said, \"and then you strip them down one more level\u2014that's the definition of a humanitarian crisis.\"      Not long after the fire in Bangladesh, James Milke '76, M.S. '81, Ph.D. '91, chair of UMD's Department of Fire Protection Engineering, began a collaboration with Kindling and fire researchers from Stellenbosch University in Cape Town, South Africa to better understand the causes and order of magnitude of fires in informal settlements\u2014the often-ramshackle housing that comprises much of the world's slums and shelters millions of displaced people. Like Antonellis, Milke sees the fire threat there, as well as within formal refugee camps, as an urgent global problem. Under his leadership, the department is collectively one of the country's foremost authorities in fire behavior, material flammability, fire detection and wildfires.\"There are informal and humanitarian settlements on every continent on the planet,\" said Milke, who plans to conduct the next phase of the research this summer. \"Fire isn't the only problem they face, but when it occurs, it is devastating to the people who live there.\"Milke recruited a legion of young people\u2014from Maryland high school students to Terps at the undergraduate and graduate levels\u2014to gather and organize data and confer with faculty at Stellenbosch, experts at Kindling and frontline responders. Students conducted initial investigations of fire phenomena in informal settlements in South Africa and generated preliminary modeling and simulations of evacuations using Pathfinder software and Google Earth imagery. A challenge with informal settlements, however, is the hands-off approach of local governments: There is no overseeing body with which to collaborate on possible interventions or solutions. Further conversations with colleagues at Stellenbosch suggested a shift to refugee camps.\"In refugee camps, organizations like the United Nations have some influence as to what these communities look like,\" Milke said. \"We realized we might have greater impact there.\"Milke's team began by researching and cataloging refugee camps globally, scrubbing through humanitarian reports and the wider internet. Their growing roster included the locations, size, demographics, and topography of camps, cooking and heating methods, fire incidents, and various materials used to construct dwellings and service areas.It quickly became clear that no two camps are alike. The urgency and economics of quickly establishing refugee camps by UNHCR and NGOs, coupled with the socioeconomic and political underpinnings of the host countries, drive everything from how densely populated the camps are to the materials used to construct shelters. Climate also plays a critical role, particularly in areas like Bangladesh that contend with wet and dry seasons. Locations are often small, undesirable parcels of land that can be hours from emergency services. Families are typically provided gas cylinders for cooking; at any given time in Kutupalong Balukhali, there could be hundreds of thousands of fires lit throughout the camp.Though the Rohingya have occupied parts of Bangladesh since the 1970s, the government's insistence that this is a temporary arrangement means they do not allow for permanent construction materials\u2014refugees use whatever is available in ample supply, often highly flammable materials. Satellite imagery shows tightly packed clusters of dwellings crosshatched with narrow dirt roads.\"It's ad hoc,\" said Dan Graham, a safety and rescue technical specialist and program manager working in Bangladesh for the international humanitarian organization Migrant Offshore Aide Station (MOAS). \"There's no grid system or numbering; people build their shelter where they dump their stuff and can get their hands-on materials. The density is something I still don't know how to articulate, and the blunt reality is that apart from the metal cooking pots and water pumps, everything in that environment is flammable.\"In 2022, Milke and then UMD graduate student Genevieve Tan '21, M.S. '22 joined researchers from Stellenbosch and MOAS' Richard Walls and Paul Chamberlain to look more closely at Kutupalong Balukhali and piece together what took place\u2014from the path of fire to response and evacuation\u2014during those seven hours in March 2021. Investigations after fires in refugee camps are often stymied by a lack of resources, but also a lack of evidence, says Antonellis.\"When these big fires occur, we never really find out from a scientific perspective why something happened the way it did,\" Tan said. \"There is a need for academia to develop methods for data collection and reporting, and use that information to characterize and understand the problem.\"Milke, Tan and their fellow researchers relied heavily on conversations with first responders and refugees on WhatsApp, on-the-ground accounts, information from international organizations and media coverage. Theirs was the first detailed documentation of a large-scale refugee camp incident in academic literature.While engineering plays an important role in understanding the issue, Antonellis points out, it is just one piece of a complex puzzle that cannot be solved without also considering the economics, social dimensions and politics at play. The humanitarian system, a mechanism set into motion by disaster or conflict, must make quick decisions about the construction and management of camps as refugees pour into them.\"Fire risk is emerging as the camp is created,\" Antonellis said. \"It's easy to say, 'Why don't you space the tents further apart or ban candles?' From a technical perspective it feels like a straightforward problem to solve, but it's not a technical problem: It's a sociotechnical problem.\"Fire behavior in humanitarian dwellings is vastly different than in a building fire. Fanned by ample fuel sources and airflow, the intensity and speed with which fires in refugee camps spread are more akin to a wildland fire, explains Maryland Engineering Professor Arnaud Trouv\u00e9. Human behavior is also a factor; most people, said Trouv\u00e9, misinterpret the speed of fire, which can travel faster than a human can run.The human element of fire is what ultimately drew Tan to fire protection engineering. At Maryland she studied disaster resilience through an internship with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which offered her an eye-opening view of the struggles people face in informal settlements.As Tan began her graduate degree, the timing of Milke's work with Kindling couldn't have been better. Under Milke and Trouv\u00e9's guidance and supported by a John L. Bryan Graduate Research Assistantship, Tan developed a thesis project to quantify the fire risk and burn behavior of humanitarian shelters using a YouTube video of a shelter fire conducted by UNHCR's Site Management Engineering Project. Using MATLAB-based image processing, Tan compared the video with an identical dwelling created using Fire Dynamics Simulator, a modeling software that until now has only been used to model room or building fires. She was able to reconcile characteristics including flame height, temperature, intensity, heat release and spread\u2014critical steps for understanding the unique characteristics of shelter fires.In the future, Tan's model could be configured to different dimensions, material properties and contents (such as furniture) as more and better data become available. Simulations based on her model could help understand the risk of spread and may inform the spacing of dwellings. Today working in fire safety consulting and system design for Baltimore-based Jensen Hughes, Tan hopes her research provides a foundation for another student to pick up where she left off.\"I had such a limited scope of data to work with, and the nature of the problem makes things very hard to nail down right now,\" she said. \"But it's so important for people to continue working in this space.\"As research on fire risk in humanitarian settlements continues\u2014 at Maryland, and at just a handful of other universities around the world studying the problem\u2014so do the fires. On March 5, 2023, yet another massive fire ripped through Rohingya refugee camps in southeastern Bangladesh, displacing an additional 12,000.According to Deb Niemeier, the Clark Distinguished Chair of Energy and Sustainability at Maryland Engineering, it's only been within the last decade that engineers have begun to work on the logistics of global humanitarian challenges such as the refugee crisis from the inside as it became clearer they could make a significant impact. Research can help bridge the significant firsthand knowledge from organizations like the UN High Commissioner for Refugees with the practice and models to understand how solutions could work on the ground.\"Engineers are terrific at figuring out logistical concerns,\" Niemeier said, \"so the role for engineers is huge. We can work on very specific issues like fire risk and raise a vigilant, observant practice so that it's safer.\"Ongoing collaboration and idea exchange with the academic community, said Graham, is essential for creating not just global awareness, but also a global response. He said that research, like the kind undertaken by Milke and students at Maryland, will keep the issue at the fore\u2014as well as provide the foundation, best practices and knowledge to establish fire management standards for refugee camps. Those standards could include a hazard warning system, similar to those used in high-risk wildfire areas, based on environmental conditions and density of the camps to alert refugees to take care with open flames and cooking.\"'Red flag days' have proven very effective for raising awareness in other parts of the world,\" Milke said. \"Could we accomplish the same here?\"This summer, Milke plans to return to where he started by completing the first complete picture of global refugee camps and fire phenomena, having students document fire events in Asia and updating the existing database. It's a critical tool for the global community in appreciating how big this problem really is, he said. The department also hopes to continue the research that Tan started by looking at the speed and progression of fire spread from one dwelling to two or three.\"This is where academia can make the biggest difference,\" said Antonellis. \"We need research like what's happening at Maryland to push under the noses of practitioners and stakeholders to provide them with the information they need to make better decisions. It's transformative for our work.\" Provided byUniversity of MarylandCitation:Seeking answers among the ashes of refugee camp fires (2023, May 2)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-ashes-refugee.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Heat waves in Aotearoa New Zealand over recent summers are already causing wide-ranging effects on the environment, a new study suggests.          Summer heat waves in 2017/18, 2018/19 and 2021/22 saw the warmest months on record, with many more warm days (\u2265 25\u00baC) than usual, says Dr. Jim Salinger, the study's lead author and adjunct research fellow at Te Herenga Waka\u2014Victoria University of Wellington.\"These warm season heat waves (from November to March) all produced dramatic climate impacts across New Zealand, including marine heat wave conditions and major loss of glacier ice volume in the Southern Alps.\"Combined, the three recent heat waves peeled 17% of the total ice off the Southern Alps glaciers, which have lost half their volume since 1949\u2014down from 65 to 32 km3 by 2021,\" Dr. Salinger says.Off the north-west and south-west coasts of New Zealand, marine heat wave conditions were extreme during these events.Professor James Bell, a co-author of the study and marine biologist at Victoria University of Wellington, says the increasing frequency and strength of marine heat waves is a major concern.\"The impacts on marine fauna of the 2021/22 heat wave were much larger than any that have been reported during previous heat waves, although they were disproportionately felt among some marine organisms,\" Professor Bell says.Koror\u0101 Little Penguins in the Bay of Plenty are among the species that researchers believe may have taken a hit from warming waters. The study suggests the 2021/22 marine heat wave may be linked to the starvation and death of koror\u0101 in the region with rising sea surface temperatures potentially affecting the animal's ability to find food.Heat waves have also been linked to the widespread bleaching of marine sponges across the north and south of New Zealand, affecting millions of sponges.\"For most marine species in our waters, we don't know their thermal thresholds\u2014the temperatures they're able to tolerate\u2014so it's possible that future, more intense marine heat waves will have even bigger impacts than we've seen to date,\" Professor Bell says.Study co-author Professor James Renwick, a professor of physical geography at the University, says heat waves of this type used to be rare, occurring once every few hundred years, but they're now happening more often as the climate warms.\"By the late 20th century, heat waves were occurring once every 40 years. With 1.5\u00b0C of warming, events such as we've seen in recent summers would have estimated recurrence intervals of two to three years. With 2\u00b0C of warming, these summers would be considered cool relative to what we'd experience with +2\u00b0C of warming,\" Professor Renwick says.Dr. Salinger says New Zealand temperatures have increased by 1.1\u00baC since the 1870s.\"Recent summer heat waves are the result of this regional warming coinciding with often strong La Ni\u00f1a and positive Southern Annular Mode conditions pushing anticyclones across southern New Zealand and to the east, with more frequent warm moist easterlies and north easterlies across the North Island,\" he says.The heat wave study is published in the journal Weather and Climate.

  "answer_squad": " The Costs of Environmental Degradation from Plastic Pollution in Selected Coastal Areas in the United Republic of Tanzania",
  "text": "Pristine beaches full of plastic waste. Picturesque rivers clogged by rubbish and discarded objects. These are not the sights that you find in travel brochures.          But for many countries around the world, which rely on tourism to support their gross domestic products (GDP), these are frequently becoming the sights that greet tourists.Professor Alistair McIlgorm, from the Australian National Center for Ocean Resources and Security (ANCORS) at the University of Wollongong (UOW), said marine plastic pollution is becoming an increasingly urgent issue in the African coastal locations of Tanzania and Zanzibar, which rely on tourism to drive the local and national economies.As the lead researcher and consultant on a recent World Bank PROBLUE study into the costs of environmental degradation from marine plastic pollution in Eastern Africa, Professor McIlgorm has seen the problem firsthand. He said, as with all plastic pollution, prevention is better than the cure.Professor McIlgorm conducted the research alongside Dr. Jian Xie, Senior Environmental Specialist at The World Bank. Titled \"The Costs of Environmental Degradation from Plastic Pollution in Selected Coastal Areas in the United Republic of Tanzania\", the report was published by the World Bank last month.The World Bank study sought to measure the environmental costs of marine plastic pollution in two sites\u2014Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and Zanzibar Island in the Zanzibar Archipelago\u2014by estimating the economic impacts on fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, health, and the marine ecosystem.The World Bank is one of the world's largest sources of funding and knowledge for developing countries. ANCORS is the only multidisciplinary university-based center of its type in the Southern Hemisphere dedicated to delivering specialized research, advisory services, education and training in ocean law and policy, maritime security, and marine resources management.This is the first study of its kind that determines the cost of environmental degradation caused by marine plastic pollution.      \"The project found that across the two sites, in 2019, there was a measurable impact of US$28 million, two thirds of which is being borne by the tourism industry,\" Professor McIlgorm said.\"Zanzibar is a popular tourist destination, and the project used survey responses from tourists to show the impact\u2014approximately US$13.7 million\u2014that marine plastic pollution has on how tourists feel about the destination. This study is a significant development in estimating the tangible impact of plastic on marine industries and the environment.\"Both Tanzania and Zanzibar have experienced considerable population growth and urbanization in recent years, the report found, and with that has come an increased demand for products that contain plastic. However, Professor McIlgorm said, like much of the continent and indeed the world, there is not the infrastructure to support disposing of those mountains of plastic.Sustaining healthy oceans and the responsible consumption of resources are both part of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals, and are central to a health future for countries and territories in East Africa.While the study focused on Tanzania and Zanzibar, it is a problem that countless countries throughout the world, who rely on tourism, are grappling with.\"There are immediate actions that can be taken, such as beach cleaning in the tourist season. But in the longer term, the challenge is how to increase the effectiveness of waste management systems. How can hotels reduce plastic in their operations? How can companies that host tourists better improve their plastic waste management?\" Professor McIlgorm said.\"Plastic waste leakage contaminates beaches and marine ecosystems and creates economic losses in local economies. Globally, only ten percent of total plastic waste is recycled and 14 percent is burned. The rest is either buried or remains unmanaged, which is how it can so easily enter waterways and the ocean.\"While the research is specific to the coast of East Africa, Professor McIlgorm said there are lessons that can be applied globally about the cost of marine plastic pollution to a town or country's economy, and the need to find ways to address this urgent global problem.\"One of the main problems in Tanzania and Zanzibar, and in many other parts of the developing world, is dealing with plastic before it enters the ocean. The Tanzania government introduced legislation banning the sale of single-use plastic bags in 2019 and this is reducing plastic waste volumes,\" Professor McIlgorm said.\"However, dealing with all plastic waste through improved solid waste management in Dar es Salaam, one of the fastest growing cities in Africa, will take significant efforts. This is an area where government, industry and NGOs can cooperate by encouraging extended producer responsibility.\"Throughout the world, marine plastic pollution imposes significant costs on economies and the environment, but these costs are avoidable. Preventing these costs can restore economic benefits, particularly for areas that rely heavily on tourism, and also go a long way towards restoring the health of our precious ocean.\"UOW Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Vice-President (Research and Sustainable Futures) Professor David Currow said this research reflected the University's commitment to sustaining coastal and marine environments for generations to come.\"Congratulations to Professor McIlgorm and to World Bank PROBLUE on this important study, which captures the impact that marine plastic pollution has upon nations that rely on tourism for the livelihood of their citizens and their economy,\" Professor Currow said.\"Marine plastic pollution is an absolute scourge on our environment, and combating this is fundamental to creating healthy, sustainable oceans for our future.\" Provided byUniversity of WollongongCitation:Report: How marine plastic pollution impacts countries that rely on tourism (2023, May 2)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-marine-plastic-pollution-impacts-countries.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "With a view toward predicting the consequences of human-made climate change for Mediterranean ecosystems, Earth scientists from Heidelberg University have studied natural climate and vegetation fluctuations of the past 500,000 years. Their primary focus was the effects of these fluctuations on the forests in the Mediterranean region.          To this end, researchers led by Dr. Andreas Koutsodendris analyzed fossil pollen preserved in a sediment core from Greece. Their investigations suggest that in long-standing drought conditions\u2014as the latest climate models predict\u2014desertification of the forests in the Mediterranean region is likely in the near future. The work is published in the journal Nature Communications.Mediterranean forests are not only hotspots of biodiversity, but they also provide critical ecosystem services. They protect against soil erosion, regulate the regional climate and hydrological conditions, and supply food and timber. \"Because they are exceptionally sensitive to climate change, concern for their survival is growing in light of anthropogenic CO2 emissions and associated global warming,\" explains Dr. Koutsodendris. He is a member of the research group of Prof. Dr. J\u00f6rg Pross, which investigates the Earth's environmental and ecosystem dynamics at Heidelberg University's Institute of Earth Sciences.To trace how Mediterranean forests reacted to climate changes in the past, the Heidelberg researchers, in cooperation with colleagues from France, Germany, Greece, and the United Kingdom, took drill cores from Tenaghi Philippon\u2014a terrestrial climate archive in the northeast of Greece\u2014that provide a complete record of the past 500,000 years, and in which fossil pollen grains are preserved.The data on vegetation development in this period gained from the pollen grains was correlated with geochemical data on contemporaneous fluctuations in precipitation. The results of the team led by Dr. Koutsodendris show that, in the past, the Mediterranean forests transformed into steppes within a few decades as soon as specific precipitation thresholds were crossed.Using ecological models, the scientists also examined possible factors that caused precipitation patterns to change. Their analyses show that changes in atmospheric CO2 content influence the amount of precipitation in the Mediterranean region.\"In the past, a decrease in rainfall of 40% to 45% was sufficient to set off a sudden shift from forest to steppe biomes under natural conditions,\" explains Dr. Koutsodendris. These results imply that such a shift could lie ahead for the forests of the Mediterranean region in the near future if nothing is done to protect them, the Heidelberg Earth scientist says.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the organization that collects information on consumer products?",
  "answer_squad": " CARB",
  "text": "People often assume that the products they use every day are safe. Now a new study by Silent Spring Institute and the University of California, Berkeley, exposes how much people come into contact with toxic ingredients in products, used at home and at work, that could harm their health. Findings from the analysis could help state and federal agencies strengthen chemical regulations and guide manufacturers in making safer products.          Many common products like shampoos, body lotions, cleaners, mothballs, and paint removers contain toxic volatile organic compounds or VOCs\u2014chemicals that escape as gases, accumulate in indoor air, and cause a variety of health problems including cancer. Because companies, for the most part, are not required to disclose what it's in their products or how much, it's difficult to know what people might be exposed to and the potential health effects.\"This study is the first to reveal the extent to which toxic VOCs are used in everyday products of all types that could lead to serious health problems,\" says lead author Kristin Knox, a scientist at Silent Spring Institute. \"Making this information public could incentivize manufacturers to reformulate their products and use safer ingredients.\"For the analysis, Knox and her colleagues turned to an unlikely source of data: The California Air Resources Board (CARB). For more than 30 years, CARB has been tracking VOCs in consumer products in an effort to reduce smog. In the presence of sunlight, VOCs react with other air pollutants to form ozone, the main ingredient in smog.Under its Consumer Product Regulatory program, CARB periodically surveys companies that sell products in California, collecting information on a wide range of items\u2014everything from hair spray to windshield wiper fluid. The data include information on the concentration of VOCs used in various types of products and how much of each product type is sold in the state. CARB does not share data on specific products.Reporting in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, the researchers analyzed the most recent CARB data, focusing on 33 VOCs listed under California's right-to-know law, Prop 65, because they cause cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm. The law requires companies that sell products in California to warn users if their products could expose them to significant amounts of these harmful chemicals.The team's analysis found more than 100 types of products contain Prop 65 VOCs. Of those, the researchers identified 30, including a dozen different types of personal care products, that deserve special scrutiny because they frequently contain harmful chemicals and may pose the greatest health risk. (Since CARB only reports on VOCs, many other toxic chemicals listed under Prop 65, such as lead, were not included in the analysis.)      Products used on the job are especially concerning, the authors note, because workers often use many different types of products, each of which likely contains at least one hazardous chemical. For instance, nail and hair salon workers use nail polishes and polish removers, artificial nail adhesives, hair straighteners, and other cosmetics. According to the analysis, these types of products combined contain as many as 9 different Prop 65 VOCs. Janitors might use a combination of general cleaners, degreasers, detergents, and other maintenance products, which could expose them to more than 20 Prop 65 VOCs.\"The same thing goes for auto and construction workers. All these exposures add up and might cause serious harm,\" says co-author Meg Schwarzman, a physician and environmental health scientist at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health who led the study. \"At the most basic level, workers deserve to know what they're exposed to. But, ultimately, they deserve safer products and this study should compel manufacturers to make significant changes to protect workers' health.\"Of the 33 VOCs listed under Prop 65, the researchers identified the top 11 chemicals that manufacturers should eliminate from products because of the chemicals' high toxicity and widespread use. Other findings include:Among products used on the body, formaldehyde was the most common Prop 65 VOC, and was found in nail polish, shampoo, makeup, and other types personal care items.For products used in the home, general purpose cleaners, art supplies, and laundry detergents contained the most Prop 65 VOCs.Adhesives contained more than a dozen different Prop 65 VOCs, highlighting that workers can be exposed to many toxic chemicals from using just one type of product.Finally, the team used the CARB data to calculate the total amount of Prop 65 VOCs emitted from consumer products indoors, and found more than 5,000 tons of volatile Prop 65 chemicals were released from products in the state of California in 2020. Nearly 300 tons of that came from mothballs (1,4-dichlorobenzene) alone.\"Although Prop 65 has reduced the public's exposure to toxic chemicals both through litigation and by incentivizing companies to reformulate their products, people continue to be exposed to many unsafe chemicals,\" says co-author Claudia Polsky, Director of the Environmental Law Clinic at UC Berkeley School of Law. \"This study shows how much work remains for product manufacturers and regulators nationwide, because the products in CARB's database are sold throughout the U.S.\"The new study offers solutions by highlighting the types of products manufacturers should reformulate to replace toxic VOCs with safer ingredients. The authors also suggest, based on their findings, that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency consider regulating five additional chemicals under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). These chemicals include ethylene oxide, styrene, 1,3-dichloropropene, diethanolamine, and cumene.For more tips on how to limit everyday exposures to harmful VOCs and other chemicals of concern, download Silent Spring's Detox Me app. More information:Identifying toxic consumer products: Novel data set reveals air emissions of potent carcinogens, reproductive toxicants, and developmental toxicants, Environmental Science & Technology (2023).

The findings reveal the mechanism that enables dense, scorching avalanches of a mixture of rock, ash and gases ejected during volcanic eruptions\u2014called pyroclastic flows\u2014to travel at up to 100 miles per hour.Better predicting the path of pyroclastic flows\u2014which can reach temperatures of 600\u00b0C\u2014could help prevent injuries and deaths following volcanic eruptions, researchers say.More than 600 million people around the world live in regions that could be hit by pyroclastic flows.The pyroclastic flow triggered by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD is one of the most famous examples of these lethal events.While scientists have long been aware of the immense dangers they pose, the underlying mechanism that enables them to travel at such high speed and long distances\u2014up to 12 miles\u2014had remained unknown.Fluid-like behaviorNow, a team led by an Edinburgh researcher has revealed the science behind so-called block-and-ash flows, the most common and destructive type of pyroclastic flow. Their work is published in the journal Nature Communications.They identified a mechanism that greatly reduces the friction of the dense volcanic mixtures, enabling them to travel at high speed.The process\u2014called fragmentation-induced fluidization\u2014causes the base layer of pyroclastic flows to exhibit fluid-like behavior.This effect is triggered by rapidly compacting the mixture, and raising the pressure between fine particles after large blocks have disintegrated into powder.This enhanced fluidity, coupled with the large amounts\u2014often millions of tons\u2014of volcanic material, is the reason pyroclastic flows can travel far at high speeds as dense avalanches, destroying everything in their path, the team says.Density changesThe researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis by examining pyroclastic flow deposits from previous eruptions at Mount Merapi in Java, Indonesia, in 2006 and 2010.They also carried out laboratory experiments and ran computer simulations to investigate the impact of density changes within pyroclastic flows and the ability of their granular mixtures to become fluid-like.\"The discovery of the fragmentation-induced fluidization process is hugely significant, as it enables us to develop more reliable numerical models that can accurately evaluate pyroclastic flow hazards around both current and potentially future active volcanoes. Our findings not only reveal a fundamental geoscience principle but also urges us to reconsider the focus of our field-based studies. This work lays the foundation for a multitude of investigations that my research group at University of Edinburgh will undertake, ultimately refining and reshaping our understanding of volcanic hazards,\" says Dr. Eric Breard, School of GeoSciences.

  "text": "Spanish farmer Juan Francisco Abellaneda's salads and watermelons fill the shelves of European supermarkets winter and summer. But maybe not for much longer.          The tap that turned the arid semi-desert of southeastern Spain into Europe's market garden may be about to be turned off, threatening the intensive farms that feed much of the continent.Spain is the EU's biggest producer of fruit and vegetables and almost half of its exports are grown by farmers like Abellaneda, the crops irrigated by huge transfers of water from the River Tagus hundreds of kilometers (miles) to the north.But with climate change hitting Spain hard, and three-quarters of the country at risk of desertification, the government has decided to limit the flow of the dwindling waters of the Tagus to the southeastern Levante.The level of the Iberian peninsula's longest river has been dropping dangerously, to the point that in some places it is possible to cross its dried-up bed by foot in summer.Just like Egypt's shrinking Nile and the Tigris in Iraq, the right to draw on the waters of the Tagus\u2014which crosses into Portugal before flowing into the Atlantic\u2014has become a political hot potato.The debate is getting even more heated in the run up to regional elections later this month, with the intensive agriculture that is a pillar of the Spanish economy called into question.\"We need the water (from the Tagus). If they take it from us, it will be nothing but a desert here,\" said Abellaneda.                Map of Spain showing the route of the water transfer from the Tagus river to the southeast where it is used to irrigate fruit and vegetable crops sold across Europe.             'What are we going to live on?'The 47-year-old cast an anxious eye over the dusty drills of broccoli growing on his 300 hectares (740 acres) near Murcia.Despite another abnormally hot and dry spring, the farm he and his brothers run is thriving, exporting 3,000 tonnes of fruit and vegetables a year.In his father and grandfather's time, Murcia was one of the poorest parts of Spain, a land of subsistence farmers. Greenhouses and hi-tech storage depots now stretch to the horizon.\"If they do not bring us the water, what are we going to live on?\" asked Abellaneda, a founder member of the Deilor cooperative which employs 700 people.He does not want to turn the clock back and fears widespread job losses if they lose water.\"The region is one of the most arid\" in Spain, said Domingo Baeza, professor of river ecology at the Autonomous University of Madrid, with not enough water of its own for its intensive agriculture.To make the bone-dry southeast bloom, Spain began building the gigantic Tagus-Segura Water Transfer project under the dictator General Franco in 1960. It took nearly 20 years to complete its 300 kilometers of canals, tunnels, aqueducts and reservoirs, bringing billions of litres of water from the Tagus south into the Segura basin between Murcia and Andalusia.Once hailed as a model in handling drought, it is now accused of making them worse.It also made the Levante region\u2014which includes the dry provinces of Murcia, Alicante and Almeria\u2014Europe's biggest horticultural hotspot, employing 100,000 people in businesses turning over three billion euros ($3.3 billion) a year.                The gigantic Tagus-Segura Water Transfer project began in 1960 and took nearly 20 years to complete.             Rivers drying upBut today \"the Tagus is suffering\", said Baeza. \"It is degraded in numerous places... because we have far outstripped its capacity (with) uncontrolled expansion of the land it irrigates.\"Since the Transfer project was built, Spain's average temperature has shot up by 1.3 degrees Centigrade (more than two degrees Fahrenheit), according to the Spanish meteorological service.The flow of the Tagus has dropped 12 percent over the same period and could plummet by up to 40 percent by 2050, the Spanish government estimates.Extreme heatwaves over the last few years, sometimes very early in the year\u2014with temperature records again broken last week\u2014have dried up rivers and reservoirs and have led to water cuts.\"Global warming has changed things,\" said Julio Barea of Greenpeace. The Transfer \"no longer works\" for Spain. \"The Tagus needs the water (it is losing to farms in the southeast) to survive,\" he insisted.In the central Castile-La Mancha region, where the Tagus' water is siphoned away south, the effects of losing so much water have been visible for years.\"Our land has been sacrificed\" for the farmers of the Levante, declared Borja Castro, Socialist mayor of Alcocer, a village near the Entrepenas and Buend\u00eda reservoirs, whose water is pumped to the southeast.Known as the \"Sea of Castile\" for the artificial lakes that were created by the damming of the Tagus in the 1950s, it used to attract lots of tourists who would come for the weekend to swim, boat and eat in its restaurants.\"It was really lively,\" recalled Borja's father, Carlos Castro, 65, pointing to the ruins of a cafe near a spot where he would come to swim as a teenager. Now \"it's like a desert,\" he sighed.                The political battle over the water in the lead-up to this month's elections has created some strange bedfellows.             'Food security at risk'The beaches where tourists once lounged have disappeared with the lake water now several dozen meters below where it was.\"Everything stopped when the damned water transfers started,\" said mayor Castro, who wants them to be stopped completely. \"With our water went businesses, jobs and a part of our population.\"They turned the Levante into the garden of Europe, but with water that came from somewhere else. It's madness.\"Madrid wants to reduce the water transfers by a third\u2014except in times of abundant rainfall\u2014to bring the Tagus's level up.But without that water, the southeast \"will not be able to maintain modern and competitive agriculture,\" which could put Europe's food security at risk, warned Alfonso Galvez, a head of the farmers' union, Asaja.The cut could lead to 12,200 hectares of arable land being abandoned, claimed the SCRATS farmers lobby group. The economic cost would also be colossal, it argued, up to 137 million euros a year, with 15,000 jobs lost.'It's just not tenable'The political battle over the water in the lead-up to this month's elections has created some strange bedfellows.                The right to draw on the waters of the Tagus -- which crosses into Portugal before flowing into the Atlantic -- has become a political hot potato.             The Socialist-held region of Valencia in the east has allied itself with Murcia, run by the conservatives of the Popular Party, to try to stop any cuts. Socialist Castile-La Mancha, meanwhile, is backing the government's decree with the help of local right-wingers.The left-wing government of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said it has no choice but to cut the flow to come into line with rulings from Spain's supreme court and EU environmental rules, which demand protection plans for water basins.Minister for Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera said the decision was based on \"the best scientific knowledge possible\", and has promised more money to develop other sources of water.The government is keen on desalination, which is already going on the Levante, but on a relatively small scale.But many farmers are not convinced. Galvez said desalinated water lacks nutrients and has \"a big environmental impact because \"you need lots of electricity to make it\" as well as its harmful effects on the marine ecosystem.The conservative head of the Murcia region, Fernando Lopez Miras, is equally skeptical. He said the costs were prohibitive\u2014three to four times more than transporting the water from the Tagus. \"They are talking about a price of around 1.4 euros a liter. That's the price of petrol!\"The farmers have a right to the water, he argued, because the constitution decreed that \"Spain's water belongs to all Spaniards\". Desalination plants were at best a help, not \"an alternative\" water source.For environmentalists, Spain's whole agricultural model has to be rethought. \"More than 80 percent of freshwater in Spain is used by agriculture... it's just not tenable,\" said Barea of Greenpeace.There has to be a drastic reduction in the amount of land given over to intensive farming if Spain is to avoid disaster, he said. \"Spain cannot be the garden of Europe if our water is getting more and more scarce.\"    \u00a9 2023 AFP Citation:Europe's produce at stake in Spain's water war (2023, May 2)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-05-europe-stake-spain-war.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Environmental campaigners urged climate envoys from dozens of nations gathering Tuesday in Berlin to discuss a global deadline for phasing out fossil fuels and ways of increasing aid to poor countries hit by global warming.          About 40 countries, including the United States, China, India and Brazil, are attending the Petersberg Climate Dialogue being held in the German capital. The two-day meeting is a key negotiating step in the run-up to this year's international climate conference in Dubai, known as COP28.Campaign groups are concerned that countries such as the U.S., COP28 host United Arab Emirates and the European Union back the idea of carbon capture as a means of allowing oil and gas extraction to continue or even expand. Scientists say technologies for removing planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere aren't proven at scale and could require huge investments at the expense of cheaper alternatives such as solar and wind power.\"They are trying their best to prolong the use of fossil fuels, especially by focusing on (...) carbon capture and storage, which is deeply worrying for us,\" said Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an end to all fossil fuel use, which is blamed for the majority of global warming that has occurred since the start of the industrial era, warning that otherwise the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) may be missed. But so far only coal has been put on notice, with a commitment by nations two years ago to \"phase down\" its use.Denmark's climate minister, Dan J\u00f8rgensen, said recently that a global pledge to also stop using oil and gas \"will be a part of the conversation\" before and during the Dubai summit.Singh said solutions also need to be found for millions of workers in the coal, oil and gas industry if it is to be wound down successfully, as well as alternative sources of energy for many who still rely on cheap fossil fuels.\"What we need to see coming out of the year is not just about fossil fuel phaseout, but equitable phaseout of fossil fuels,\" he said.Diplomats will also be discussing how to ramp up various forms of financial aid for developing countries hardest hit by climate change. A pledge to provide $100 billion every year has yet to be met and a separate fund, agreed at last year's climate talks in Egypt, is still being set up.U.S. climate envoy John Kerry has said the total amount needed to help all countries make the economic transition to a green economy will run into the trillions of dollars. Experts say that in addition to aid, large sums will need to come from the private sector. Other sources such as carbon taxes on air and sea travel have also been floated.\"These big questions about where the finance is going to come from for countries to deliver any of their potential climate policies or energy transition policies need to reach some answers before (COP28),\" said Alex Scott, head of climate diplomacy at the environmental think tank E3G.    \u00a9 2023 The Associated Press.

  "text": "A new special edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) focuses on helping federal regulators measure the value that U.S. residents place on clean water, just months before the Supreme Court is set to decide a case with significant implications for the Clean Water Act.          The issue was proposed and co-edited by economist Catherine Kling, faculty director of the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability, along with two academic colleagues, at University of Massachusetts, Amherst and University of Wisconsin, Madison, and two Environmental Protection Agency economists. The edition, published May 2, should also shed light on discussions around the EPA's much-revised \"Waters of the United States\" regulation, which went into effect in March and has been a source of long-standing political debate.\"We're not advocating for or against any particular regulation; this is our best effort at science,\" said Kling, the Tisch University Professor of Environmental, Energy and Resource Economics in the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management and the Cornell Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy. \"We're trying to fully document the benefits as compared to the costs and provide the best, defensible tradeoff numbers that we can so that EPA can make the most appropriate regulations.\"Chris Moore, an EPA economist and co-editor of the special issue, said the EPA can use the new research to improve its economic analyses and estimate more types of benefits from water quality improvements.\"Valuing the social benefits of programs that improve water quality is especially difficult because of the many ways that people rely upon clean water,\" Moore said. \"Figuring out who will be affected by a given action and how to estimate the economic impacts is uniquely challenging when aquatic resources are involved. The research featured in this special issue makes important advances on several fronts that address those challenges.\"50 years of the Clean Water ActThe Clean Water Act was passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in 1972; though vetoed by then-President Richard Nixon, Congress overrode his veto to enact the law. In the 50 years since its implementation, the Clean Water Act has enabled regulators to require companies to stop dumping oil and toxic chemicals directly into the nation's waterways and to require local municipalities to treat sewage before release, among other provisions. Although U.S. water quality has improved significantly since 1972, challenges remain: Almost half of rivers and streams are in \"poor biological condition and 21% of the nation's lakes have excessively high levels of nutrients and algae,\" according to the introduction in the PNAS special edition.In 1986, then-President Ronald Reagan issued an executive order requiring federal regulators to undertake benefit-cost analyses for almost every rule. This resulted in regulators scrambling to assess the economic value of natural resources.\"It's much easier to figure out the cost piece: Companies will have to regulate something or put on pollution control. The harder part to value is the benefit,\" Kling said. \"But just because something isn't bought and sold doesn't mean people don't value it. And if we had to, many of us would pay money rather than see a park eliminated or our water quality degraded. That's the concept of economic value.\"      Advancing the science of public benefitEven before Reagan's executive order, scientists had been working to understand how the public values noncommercial resources like clean air and water. A groundbreaking 1981 study used a nationwide survey to ask residents how much they would be willing to pay in taxes and higher prices to improve the nation's water quality to one of three standards: boatable, fishable and swimmable. The first national survey of its kind, the study found strong support for improved water quality, and the EPA relied upon the study for a variety of regulations, including one that limited the release of organic chemicals, plastics and synthetic fibers into waterways.The scientists who contributed to the water quality research in PNAS this month have built upon that foundation and upon the 50 years of research since in the fields of economics, natural resources, ecology, sociology, survey methods, and more, Kling said. For example, survey research has consistently found that people assign intrinsic value to natural resources whether or not they engage in outdoor recreation; New Yorkers value the existence of black bears in the state even if they never go hunting, surveys have repeatedly found.In their study reported in PNAS, Kling and her co-authors attempted to measure such intrinsic benefits of clean water in a survey of 2,000 households across the Midwest, in the upper Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee river basins. In addition to questioning residents about outdoor recreation, they measured how much respondents value biodiversity by showing graphical representations of native species that could live in water at various quality levels. They found that residents were willing to pay $456 per household per year in additional taxes or higher prices to support cleaner water. Across the entire region, that means residents value the benefits of clean water $10.5 billion above what is already being spent.\"By partnering with ecologists and economists, we can understand how water equality is more broadly valuable, not just to swimming but also to habitat and preservation of natural resources,\" Kling said. \"And by partnering with EPA, we are trying to ensure that the information we produce is answering the questions regulators need to answer in order to make the best possible decisions about how to allocate our tax dollars.\" More information:Christian A.

  "answer_squad": " hyperarid salars",
  "text": "Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the University of Alaska Anchorage are the first to characterize two different types of surface water in the hyperarid salars\u2014or salt flats\u2014that contain much of the world's lithium deposits. This new characterization represents a leap forward in understanding how water moves through such basins, and will be key to minimizing the environmental impact on such sensitive, critical habitats.          \"You can't protect the salars if you don't first understand how they work,\" says Sarah McKnight, lead author of the research that appeared recently in Water Resources Research. She completed this work as part of her Ph.D in geosciences at UMass Amherst.Think of a salar as a giant, shallow depression into which water is constantly flowing, both through surface runoff but also through the much slower flow of subsurface waters. In this depression, there's no outlet for the water, and because the bowl is in an extremely arid region, the rate of evaporation is such that enormous salt flats have developed over millennia.There are different kinds of water in this depression; generally the nearer the lip of the bowl, the fresher the water. Down near the bottom of the depression, where the salt flats occur, the water is incredibly salty. However, the salt flats are occasionally pocketed with pools of brackish water. Many different kinds of valuable metals can be found in the salt flats\u2014including lithium\u2014while the pools of brackish water are critical habitat for animals like flamingoes and vicu\u00f1as.One of the challenges of studying these systems is that many salars are relatively inaccessible. The one McKnight studies, the Salar de Atacama in Chile, is sandwiched between the Andes and the Atacama Desert. Furthermore, the hydrogeology is incredibly complex: water comes into the system from Andean runoff, as well as via the subsurface aquifer, but the process governing how exactly snow and groundwater eventually turn into salt flat is difficult to pin down.                Springs, runoff and release of groundwater storage result in the temporal variability of inflow to the salt flats. Credit: Sarah McKnight             Add to this the increased mining pressure in the area and the poorly understood effects it may have on water quality, as well as the mega-storms whose intensity and precipitation has increased markedly due to climate change, and you get a system whose workings are difficult to understand.However, combining observations of surface and groundwater with data from the Sentinel-2 satellite and powerful computer modeling, McKnight and her colleagues were able to see something that has so far remained invisible to other researchers.      It turns out that not all water in the salar is the same. What McKnight and her colleagues call \"terminal pools\" are brackish ponds of water located in what is called the \"transition zone,\" or the part of the salar where the water is increasingly briny but has not yet reached full concentration.Then there are the \"transitional pools,\" which are located right at the boundary between the briny waters and the salt flats. Water comes into each of these pools from different sources\u2014some of them quite far away from the pools they feed\u2014and exits the pools via different pathways.\"It's important to define these two different types of surface waters,\" says McKnight, \"because they behave very differently. After a major storm event, the terminal pools flood quickly, and then quickly recede back to their pre-flood levels. But the transitional pools take a very long time\u2014from a few months to almost a year\u2014to recede back to their normal level after a major storm.\"All of this has implications for how these particular ecosystems are managed. \"We need to treat terminal and transitional pools differently,\" says McKnight, \"which means paying more attention to where the water in the pools comes from and how long it takes to get there.\" More information:S.

  "answer_squad": " Subglacial Antarctic Lake Scientific Access",
  "text": "Subglacial lakes that never see the light of day are among the least accessible frontiers of science, brimming with more tales yet untold than even the planets of our solar system. One thing seems certain: where there is water, there is life\u2014even if said water is at the bottom of a frigid lake, in pitch darkness, below more than a half mile of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.       As reported in AGU Advances, scientists analyzed the chemical fingerprint of the ocean and microbes retrieved from sediments and water at the bottom of a subglacial lake called Mercer Lake to describe, for the first time, where the feisty microbes get carbon, the energy source du jour, and move it through this fiercely desolate system. They used the data from the sediment, microbes and the carbon cycle to infer the geologic history of this region, and the results surprised them.While they previously thought that the ice over Mercer Lake had been stable for up to hundreds of millennia, this new work confirms the lake was connected to the ocean about 6,000 years ago, and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was smaller than it is today. This was a period when climate was stable relative to the end of the last ice age and even to today's anthropogenic climate change.                The West Antarctic Ice Sheet retreated at least 250 kilometers (160 miles) inland of where the ice meets the ocean today, then re-advanced, according to new research published in AGU Advances. Scientists traced the ice's movement using sediments from a lake more than 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) under the ice, sampled using the corer in this photo. Credit: Billy Collins             \"This is the first time we have unequivocal geologic proof that the grounding line of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which is like its shoreline where the ice meets the ocean, was at least 250 kilometers further inland than it is today\u2014possibly more,\" said Ryan Venturelli, lead author of the study and assistant professor at the Colorado School of Mines. Venturelli performed the work with her former Ph.D. advisor, marine geologist Brad Rosenheim at the University of South Florida College of Marine Science.In other words, just a few thousand years ago the West Antarctic Ice Sheet retreated about 155 miles\u2014a few dozen miles shy of the distance from New York to Boston\u2014before re-growing to its modern configuration.                Pressure ridges form near McMurdo Station in Antarctica where sea ice and the Ross Ice Shelf collide. This site is home to beautiful ice forms and cracks that provide Weddell Seals areas to jump onto the ice shelf and give birth to their pups. Credit: Ryan Venturelli             \"These are real numbers from water and sediment samples that can now be used to validate ice sheet models,\" Venturelli said.Venturelli and Rosenheim retrieved the samples from Mercer Lake, a few hundred miles from the South Pole, as part of a 25-member team on the historic expedition called Subglacial Antarctic Lake Scientific Access, or SALSA. They were on site from December 2018 to January 2019. The team used a clean-access, custom hot water drill to retrieve the longest core to date from a subglacial lake\u2014about seven feet long. They drilled through more than a half mile of ice to get it, working against the clock while the water-filled hole refroze.It was only the second time in history that scientists have retrieved a sediment core from a subglacial lake. (The first was retrieved from Lake Whillans in 2013.)\"This work is a big step forward for us,\" Rosenheim said. \"We'd thought the glacier retreated back to where it is now but it went back well beyond that, which indicates the ice is a lot more dynamic than we realized. Now we need to incorporate this new understanding into models so we can better predict what may happen in the future as the planet warms.\"The team used tools of geochemistry, including analyses of isotopes and radiocarbon dating to figure out how carbon cycles through the system. They combined that with known estimates of microbial metabolism to mathematically confirm when the grounding line of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet retreated.\"Prior to this study we had not yet confirmed the maximum extent of the last deglaciation,\" Venturelli said.

Credit: Billy Collins                                     Surprising results from historic study suggest the shrinking West Antarctic Ice Sheet, a major threat to global sea level rise, was smaller and more dynamic in recent geologic past than previously thought.

Archaea are microorganisms distinct from bacteria that have been found in other extreme environments, such as hot springs on land and hydrothermal vents in the deep sea.The pool of carbon in the sediment at the bottom of Mercer Lake is at least 100 times bigger than any other carbon pool in the cycle\u2014and the microbes use it efficiently, Venturelli said. They also use carbon that is introduced to the system from water bodies upstream. Subglacial lakes can be ephemeral and are more like a braided subglacial river system than a sealed-off lake system.\"Think of these lakes not as separate ecosystems but as a network of communities that are connected by the transport of water and sediment,\" Christner said.

Credit: Billy Collins                 Painting the bigger pictureThe fate of the Antarctic ice sheet holds extraordinary implications for sea level rise around the globe. If the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet were to melt, some estimates suggest it would add more than nine feet to coastlines around the globe.\"There is a lot of hopeless doom and gloom out there in climate science,\" Venturelli said. \"I find hope in the fact that this work highlights that the ice sheets are much more dynamic than we previously appreciated, and we need to probe this idea of reversibility\u2014what were the forcing mechanisms that caused the ice sheet to re-advance to where it is today?\u2014so we can better predict future scenarios.\"Scientists estimate that there may be more than 650 subglacial lakes in Antarctica\u2014so they have, between this core study and the first in 2013, literally just begun to scratch the surface of their mysteries with two main data points. But one thing is for sure, says Venturelli: Looking at the base of the glacier, particularly the water and sediment in these subglacial lake systems, is worth the extra effort.\"We couldn't have learned these things by poking at marine sediments from the outside from a ship,\" she said. \"Sometimes it takes looking at an old problem in a new way to really unearth exciting findings.\" More information:Ryan A.

  "text": "Twenty years after the Old Man of the Mountain collapsed, audiences around the world will now be able to explore the iconic symbol of New Hampshire through an online interactive 3D model created by Matthew Maclay, a graduate student in earth sciences at Dartmouth's Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies.          The face-shaped granite formation on the northeast side of Cannon Cliff in Franconia Notch State Park fell off the cliff on May 3, 2003, drawing international attention and dismay in New Hampshire itself.\"People continue to have a very emotional connection to the Old Man of the Mountain\u2014the state emblem of New Hampshire, so I am really excited that this 3D model will provide the public with an opportunity to learn more about this natural wonder and the weathering processes affecting the underlying geological structure of the area,\" says Maclay.As part of the research project, Maclay and collaborators Jesse Casana and Carolin Ferwerda at Dartmouth's Spatial Archaeometry Lab performed aerial surveys of Cannon Cliff using a drone. They then reconstructed the now lost profile using original film negatives taken between 1958 and 1976 that documented the Old Man of the Mountain and surrounding area during maintenance conducted by the profile's caretakers.Maclay processed the imagery in the Planetary Surface Processes Computing Lab led by Marisa Palucis, an assistant professor of earth sciences at Dartmouth. By applying photogrammetry, a technique akin to the way that eyes provide depth perception, Maclay was able to create a 3D model of Cannon Cliff with and without the Old Man of the Mountain.\"As a New Hampshire native, I visited the Old Man many times as a child and like so many other state residents I felt a real sense of loss when it finally collapsed,\" says collaborator Jesse Casana, a professor of anthropology and director of the Spatial Archaeometry Lab at Dartmouth. \"I'm really happy to be part of this project helping to digitally bring the Old Man back to life.\"Through the modern 3D model, viewers can zoom around Cannon Cliff, which is approximately one mile across and 1,000 feet tall in size and see where the Old Man used to be located.\"Cannon Cliff is one of the largest cliffs in the eastern United States and it looms over a massive pile of rocky debris ranging in size from sand to boulders larger than cars,\" says Maclay. \"It's an enormous slope of loose rocks, which serves as evidence of the efficient bedrock weathering and rockfall that has been taking place since the last ice sheet retreated, around 12,000 years ago.\"      In his research, Maclay is studying how climate-based processes break down bedrock physically and chemically in place, which in turn loosens and frees up the bedrock for rockfall.\"Understanding which areas of Cannon Cliff may be especially susceptible to rockfall is important given the popularity of the area as a year-round climbing and tourist destination,\" he says.\"The bedrock weathering processes are also significant because they are breaking down rocks on the slope into sediment, which is how soil is made,\" says Maclay.Credit: Dartmouth CollegePrior research has found that the cold, harsh winters and warm, wet summers in the White Mountains create conditions for efficient soil production, which may be affected by a warming climate.As part of the ongoing project, the researchers installed 24 sensors that record the bedrock temperature at Cannon Cliff. They will also be conducting laboratory analyses of rock samples from the area to investigate chemical changes in minerals due to mildy acidic rainwater and snowmelt.Through the model, Maclay was able to estimate the volume and mass of rock that was lost when the Old Man of the Mountain fell, which couldn't be calculated until now. According to his measurements, around 750 cubic meters of granite fell, so he says it would have been tremendously heavy.\"The Old Man of the Mountain may have weighed nearly 2,000 tons, when it collapsed,\" says Maclay. \"While 3-inch turn buckles had been bolted into the Old Man to try and prevent it from falling, the actual strength of the granite was degraded over centuries and that's probably why it collapsed.\"He says the same forces that shaped the Old Man of the Mountain are still active on Cannon Cliff today.\"The Old Man's face is no longer perched on that rocky outcrop, but he wasn't the first rockfall and he's not the last. There are still rockfalls happening at Cannon Cliff, as it's one of the most dynamic places in the White Mountains.\"The debut of the 3D model coincides with a virtual event on Wednesday, May 3 at 11 a.m. commemorating the 20th anniversary of the collapse. The online event will feature a historical perspective from the Museum of the White Mountains in Plymouth, N.H., on how the Old Man shaped New Hampshire's identity from its first recorded discovery in the early 19th century until today.It will also include an introduction to the ongoing geological research of the Old Man and the Cannon Cliff by Maclay and a medley of personal stories and poems from local public school students in Franconia, N.H. and Lincoln, N.H.The event will also feature the release of a new song, Great Stone Face, by New Hampshire songwriter Rick Lang.\"This model has for the first time enabled a precise determination of how much rock fell from Cannon Cliff when the Old Man collapsed,\" says Brian K. Fowler, president of the Old Man of the Mountain Legacy Fund, a longtime scholar of the White Mountains and engineering geologist, who conducted the geological survey in 1976 prior to the construction of Interstate 93 through Franconia Notch.\"For years, Brian Fowler has studied Cannon Cliff to understand the geology and stability of the Old Man of the Mountain, and well before that, there were efforts to preserve the delicate formation,\" says Maclay. \"One of the most rewarding aspects of this project has been collaborating with Brian and meeting so many people who care about the cliff.\"\"I hope that our research will get people excited about visiting Franconia Notch State Park, where they can look at the stunning Cannon Cliff from some of the many nearby hiking trails and see 'geology in action,' as we like to call it,\" says Maclay.

  "text": "The northeast U.S. is no stranger to extreme weather and the warnings that come with it. But every now and then, residents are faced with an unfamiliar color in the forecast: red.          \"If you get a red-flag warning on Long Island, the hair should stand up on the back of your neck,\" Heath Hockenberry, a fire weather program manager with the U.S. National Weather Service, said. \"It is something to pay attention to.\"The NWS issues an array of warnings and watches, but the most important during fire season is a red-flag warning, which actually shows up as neon pink on the weather map. These warnings can be issued in any place at any time, though. In mid-April, for example, the agency issued rare red flag warnings in the northeast U.S., including in the New York metro area. But unlike most of the other bulletins that flow out from the agency, weather is only a part of the message.Red-flag warnings are issued when wildfires are expected to rage out of control. They've been around since the 1960s, making them older than the National Weather Service's name, which was adopted in the 1970s (It was formerly known as the U.S. Weather Bureau).The agency raises red-flag warnings when humidity drops, winds rise, and vegetation is primed and ready to burn. It is that last part about potential fuels that marks one of the differences versus warnings focusing on thunderstorms, tornados and blizzards. The other is that humans play a major role in igniting wildfires.People cannot start a tornado, but they are responsible for about half of all wildfires, Hockenberry said.While dry air and high winds can occur anywhere in the U.S., the condition of trees and plants varies by region, he said. In the northeast U.S., trees have adapted to handle dry spells, meaning they don't burn as efficiently. That's in part why the region only sees a handful of red flag warnings each year.In the southeastern U.S., many trees are filled with oily, burnable resin. When conditions dry out, the fire danger rises dramatically, Hockenberry said. A week without rain can prime the vegetation to burn.Meanwhile, in the West, fire is a natural part of many ecosystems. It only takes a few hours of low humidity to prime grasses and small shrubs to become wildfire fuel. Parts of this region as well as the Great Plains can see red-flag warnings at almost any time of year.Although hot and dry weather are hallmarks of climate change, red-flag warnings themselves aren't a good measure of the effect of rising greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere, said Hockenberry. About 8,000 per year are posted across the country.The NWS has issued more warnings than average over the past two years, but overall, the numbers are too inconsistent to tease out a trend. What is known, though, is the warming world has increased the length of wildfire season in many parts of the U.S. That trend is expected to continue as the planet heats up further.\"We are busier for longer,\" Hockenberry said. In fact, it doesn't make sense to think of a particular fire season in most places; now it has become a \"fire year.\" For those living in fire-prone areas, that will make it even more important to keep eye out for red-flag warnings.    2023 Bloomberg L.P.Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

  "text": "The infrastructure that brings drinking water to homes is an investment. For millions of people, forests are part of the system behind their faucets. Over the coming decades, many forested watersheds could be lost to development, lowering water quality and raising water treatment costs, according to a new study published in the journal Science of the Total Environment.          The research team focused on the forest-water connection in the southern U.S., a complex, heterogeneous region and, unfortunately, an ideal place for studying forest loss and worsening water quality. More than 80% of southern forests are privately owned, and the human population is growing. More southern forests have been lost to development than anywhere else in the U.S. When forests are replaced by parking lots, neighborhoods, and other development, the loss is essentially irreversible.\"To our knowledge, this is the first study to combine water quality data, land cover projections, and information about public water systems at a large scale,\" says Peter Caldwell, a Forest Service researcher and lead author of the new study.\"Our research team includes economists who will link water quality and water treatment costs,\" says Caldwell. \"This line of research could one day inform programs that compensate private forest landowners for the ecosystem services their forested watersheds provide.\"\"We examined small watersheds across a broad region,\" says Katherine Martin, a researcher at North Carolina State University and a co-author of the study. \"From Virginia to Texas, and across different forest types, soils, topography, and hydroclimates, our results confirm that forests are important for water quality.\"Water running off forested lands generally has lower concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorous, and suspended sediment than water leaving any other type of land, as the study shows.But there are nuances to the connection between clean water and forests. Some individual forested watersheds can have lower water quality, perhaps because of the type of soil and rock in the watershed, or sediment erosion in the stream channel. \"These factors and others can make quantifying forest benefits challenging,\" says Caldwell.Nevertheless, losing forests to any other land use would likely result in lower water quality, the study suggests. For example, developing just 1% of forests upstream of an intake could result in an 0.4% increase in the concentration of suspended sediment in the water, on average.Municipalities that draw water directly from rivers are at higher risk of lower water quality, now and in the future. Water drawn from a river instead of from a reservoir already tends to need more treatment before the water is drinkable. Municipalities that draw water from smaller watersheds also face higher risks, since any forest lost in a small watershed can represent a larger proportion of its area.Protecting forested watersheds can help safeguard future drinking water supplies. In general, the more forested land upstream of the intake facility, the better the water quality.The new study is related to a large body of research on how people depend on forested watersheds for their drinking water.The research team also works with coalitions such as Keeping Forests. \"We bring scientists, business leaders, and conservation experts together to develop market-based approaches to support private landowners,\" says Laura Calandrella, executive director of Keeping Forests. \"By illuminating the economic and environmental benefits of southern forests, we are empowering people to keep forests as forests.\" More information:Peter V.
