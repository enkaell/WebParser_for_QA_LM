  "text": "Conventional implantable medical devices designed for brain stimulation are often too rigid and bulky for what is one of the body's softest and most delicate tissues.          To address the problem, Rice University engineers have developed minimally invasive, ultraflexible nanoelectrodes that could serve as an implanted platform for administering long-term, high-resolution stimulation therapy.According to a study published in Cell Reports, the tiny implantable devices formed stable, long-lasting and seamless tissue-electrode interfaces with minimal scarring or degradation in rodents. The devices delivered electrical pulses that match neuronal signaling patterns and amplitudes more closely than stimuli from conventional intracortical electrodes.The devices' high biocompatibility and precise spatiotemporal stimulus control could enable the development of new brain stimulation therapies such as neuronal prostheses for patients with impaired sensory or motor functions.\"This paper uses imaging, behavioral and histological techniques to show how these tissue-integrated electrodes improve the efficacy of stimulation,\" said Lan Luan, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering and a corresponding author on the study. \"Our electrode delivers tiny electrical pulses to excite neural activity in a very controllable manner.\"We were able to reduce the current necessary to elicit neuronal activation by more than an order of magnitude. Pulses can be as subtle as a couple hundred microseconds in duration and one or two microamps in amplitude.\"The new electrode design developed by researchers in the Rice Neuroengineering Initiative represents a significant improvement over conventional implantable electrodes used to treat conditions such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and obsessive-compulsive disorder, which can cause adverse tissue responses and unintended changes in neural activity.\"Conventional electrodes are very invasive,\" said Chong Xie, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering and a corresponding author of the study. \"They recruit thousands or even millions of neurons at a time.\"\"Each of those neurons is supposed to have their own tune and coordinate in a specific pattern. But when you shock them all at the same time, you're basically disrupting their function. In some cases that works fine for you and has the desired therapeutic effect. But if, for example, you want to encode sensory information, you need much greater control over the stimuli.\"Xie likened stimulation via conventional electrodes with the disruptive effect of \"blowing an airhorn in everyone's ear or having a loudspeaker blaring\" in a roomful of people.\"We used to have this very big loudspeaker, and now everyone has an earpiece,\" he said.The ability to adjust the frequency, duration and intensity of the signals could enable the development of novel sensory prosthetic devices.\"Neuron activation is more diffuse if you use a larger current,\" Luan said. \"We were able to reduce the current and showed that we have a much more focused activation. This can translate to higher-resolution stimulation devices.\"Luan and Xie are core members of the Rice Neuroengineering Initiative and their labs are also collaborating on the development of an implantable visual prosthetic device for blind patients.\"Envision one day being able to implant electrode arrays to restore impaired sensory function: The more focused and deliberate is the activation of the neurons, the more precise the sensation you're generating,\" Luan said.An earlier iteration of the devices was used to record brain activity.\"We have had a series of publications showing this intimate tissue integration enabled by our electrode's ultraflexible design really improves our ability to record brain activity for longer durations and with better signal-to-noise ratios,\" said Luan, who has been promoted to associate professor effective July 1.

  "text": "Diagnosing and treating gastrointestinal tract diseases can be notoriously invasive and time-consuming: blood and stool lab work; biopsies, colonoscopies and endoscopies; and X-rays, CT scans and MRI imaging. But what if there was an alternative as simple as popping a Bayer aspirin?          Researchers in the University of Maryland's MEMS Sensors and Actuators Laboratory (MSAL) in the A. James Clark School of Engineering have developed an ingestible capsule with a new packaging technology that can protect its tiny components in the sometimes harsh environment of the GI tract, then dissolve at precise moments and locations needed to deliver drugs, reveal sensors or carry out other functions.Their study, published in Microsystems & Nanoengineering, describes how this packaging, called a freestanding region-responsive bilayer (FRRB), can protect the capsule as it navigates the GI tract and performs complex diagnostic and therapeutic tasks like sensing, monitoring and drug delivery.\"Ingestible capsule devices are the next frontier of medical technology,\" said bioengineering Ph.D. student Michael Straker, first author of the paper. \"The FRRB is a simple yet elegant solution to one of the major challenges of developing these devices. It can be used to develop creative new designs, allowing sensitive actuators and sensors to reach targeted regions of the GI tract unscathed.\"Co-authors on the paper include materials science and engineering Ph.D. student Joshua Levy, electrical and computer engineering Ph.D. candidate Justin Stine, Vivian Borbash '22, research associate Luke Beardslee and Herbert Rabin Distinguished Chair in Engineering Reza Ghodssi, who directs the MSAL.Their work focuses on addressing autoimmune disorders like inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and affects more than 3 million Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It also could eventually be useful for conditions involving gut-brain connections, such as depression.For many years, pharmaceutical companies have relied on pH-responsive materials, commonly known as an \"enteric\" coating, to deliver drugs into the body; it is used in the daily aspirin that many people take for heart health. But enteric coatings aren't sophisticated enough to protect an ingestible capsule from the acidic fluids and solids it encounters as it journeys through the GI tract en route to the intended destination: the intestines. It has to remain intact so that the components, such as the sensor or the drug, can be uncovered and released at the right time.One idea that has been tried is adding an opening mechanism to the capsule. However, such mechanisms can be bulky and add complexity and weight to the device. They also may require stimulus from beyond the capsule, through high-powered equipment.The FRRB developed by MSAL, a research group focused on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) with a long history of groundbreaking research into ingestible capsules, is a more versatile option. It can be readily applied to various ingestible capsule components, can be fabricated into a number of shapes, and can protect those fragile components within the GI tract until they reach their intended destination, then dissolve away so they can perform the functions for which they were designed, in sequential order.\"It is our expectation that this manufacturing approach will widen the design paradigm of developing minimally invasive micro/nano/bio devices and systems for health care monitoring, treatment and prevention applications,\" said Ghodssi.

  "text": "Infections caused by fungi, such as Candida albicans, pose a significant global health risk due to their resistance to existing treatments, so much so that the World Health Organization has highlighted this as a priority issue.          Although nanomaterials show promise as antifungal agents, current iterations lack the potency and specificity needed for quick and targeted treatment, leading to prolonged treatment times and potential off-target effects and drug resistance.Now, in a groundbreaking development with far-reaching implications for global health, a team of researchers jointly led by Hyun (Michel) Koo of the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine and Edward Steager of Penn's School of Engineering and Applied Science has created a microrobotic system capable of rapid, targeted elimination of fungal pathogens.\"Candidae forms tenacious biofilm infections that are particularly hard to treat,\" Koo says. \"Current antifungal therapies lack the potency and specificity required to quickly and effectively eliminate these pathogens, so this collaboration draws from our clinical knowledge and combines Ed's team and their robotic expertise to offer a new approach.\"The team of researchers is a part of Penn Dental's Center for Innovation & Precision Dentistry, an initiative that leverages engineering and computational approaches to uncover new knowledge for disease mitigation and advance oral and craniofacial health care innovation.For this paper, published in Advanced Materials, the researchers capitalized on recent advancements in catalytic nanoparticles, known as nanozymes, and they built miniature robotic systems that could accurately target and quickly destroy fungal cells. They achieved this by using electromagnetic fields to control the shape and movements of these nanozyme microrobots with great precision.\"The methods we use to control the nanoparticles in this study are magnetic, which allows us to direct them to the exact infection location,\" Steager says. \"We use iron oxide nanoparticles, which have another important property, namely that they're catalytic.\"                Electromagnetic cores precisely guide the array of nanozyme-bots as they target the site of fungal infection. Credit: Min Jun Oh and Seokyoung Yoon             Steager's team developed the motion, velocity, and formations of nanozymes, which resulted in enhanced catalytic activity, much like the enzyme peroxidase, which helps break down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. This directly allows the generation of high amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), compounds that have proven biofilm-destroying properties, at the site of infection.      However, the truly pioneering element of these nanozyme assemblies was an unexpected discovery: their strong binding affinity to fungal cells. This feature enables a localized accumulation of nanozymes precisely where the fungi reside and, consequently, targeted ROS generation. \"Our nanozyme assemblies show an incredible attraction to fungal cells, particularly when compared to human cells,\" Steager says. \"This specific binding interaction paves the way for a potent and concentrated antifungal effect without affecting other uninfected areas.\"Coupled with the nanozyme's inherent maneuverability, this results in a potent antifungal effect, demonstrating the rapid eradication of fungal cells within an unprecedented 10-minute window.Looking forward, the team sees the potential of this unique nanozyme-based robotics approach, as they incorporate new methods to automate control and delivery of nanozymes. The promise it holds for antifungal therapy is just the beginning. Its precise targeting, rapid action suggest potential for treating other types of stubborn infections.\"We've uncovered a powerful tool in the fight against pathogenic fungal infections,\" Koo says. \"What we have achieved here is a significant leap forward, but it's also just the first step. The magnetic and catalytic properties combined with unexpected binding specificity to fungi open exciting opportunities for an automated 'target-bind-and-kill' antifungal mechanism. We are eager to delve deeper and unlock its full potential.\"This robotics approach opens up a new frontier in the fight against fungal infections and marks a pivotal point in antifungal therapy. With a new tool in their arsenal, medical and dental professionals are closer than ever to effectively combating these difficult pathogens.

  "text": "The first protein-based nano-computing agent that functions as a circuit has been created by Penn State researchers. The milestone puts them one step closer to developing next-generation cell-based therapies to treat diseases like diabetes and cancer.          Traditional synthetic biology approaches for cell-based therapies, such as ones that destroy cancer cells or encourage tissue regeneration after injury, rely on the expression or suppression of proteins that produce a desired action within a cell. This approach can take time (for proteins to be expressed and degrade) and cost cellular energy in the process. A team of Penn State College of Medicine and Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences researchers are taking a different approach.\"We're engineering proteins that directly produce a desired action,\" said Nikolay Dokholyan, G. Thomas Passananti Professor and vice chair for research in the Department of Pharmacology. \"Our protein-based devices or nano-computing agents respond directly to stimuli (inputs) and then produce a desired action (outputs).\"In a study published in Science Advances, Dokholyan and bioinformatics and genomics doctoral student Jiaxing Chen describe their approach to creating their nano-computing agent. They engineered a target protein by integrating two sensor domains, or areas that respond to stimuli. In this case, the target protein responds to light and a drug called rapamycin by adjusting its orientation, or position in space.To test their design, the team introduced their engineered protein into live cells in culture. By exposing the cultured cells to the stimuli, they used equipment to measure changes in cellular orientation after cells were exposed to the sensor domains' stimuli.                Jiaxing Chen, a bioinformatics and genomics doctoral student at Penn State College of Medicine and Penn State Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences, is part of the Penn State research team to create the first protein-based nano-computing agent that functions as a circuit. Credit: Penn State Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences             Previously, their nano-computing agent required two inputs to produce one output. Now, Chen says there are two possible outputs and the output depends on which order the inputs are received. If rapamycin is detected first, followed by light, the cell will adopt one angle of cell orientation, but if the stimuli are received in a reverse order, then the cell adopts a different orientation angle. Chen says this experimental proof-of-concept opens the door for the development of more complex nano-computing agents.\"Theoretically, the more inputs you embed into a nano-computing agent, the more potential outcomes that could result from different combinations,\" Chen said. \"Potential inputs could include physical or chemical stimuli and outputs could include changes in cellular behaviors, such as cell direction, migration, modifying gene expression and immune cell cytotoxicity against cancer cells.\"The team plans to further develop their nano-computing agents and experiment with different applications of the technology. Dokholyan, a researcher with Penn State Cancer Institute and Penn State Neuroscience Institute, said their concept could someday form the basis of the next-generation cell-based therapies for various diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, viral infections, diabetes, nerve injury and cancer.Yashavantha Vishweshwaraiah, Richard Mailman and Erdem Tabdanov of Penn State College of Medicine also contributed to this research.

  "text": "Chemists from the National University of Singapore (NUS) have developed a scalable hydrothermal approach for obtaining ferromagnetic single-atom spin catalysts which can boost the efficiency of water splitting reactions under the influence of a magnetic field.          Electrolysis of water using renewable resources is a promising technology for hydrogen production and is having a growing interest worldwide. This is because hydrogen is seen as a promising alternative to address the increasing concerns over carbon emissions from fossil fuels that can cause climate change.However, hydrogen production via water electrolysis is primarily limited by the sluggish kinetics of an associated process known as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Precious metal based electrocatalysts are often used in the OER process to improve its poor efficiency. A pioneering class of catalytic materials known as heterogeneous ferromagnetic single-atom spin catalysts (SASCs), when used together with an applied magnetic field has great potential to accelerate this chemical reaction.However, the design of such efficient and robust SASCs for the OER process is still recognized as a major challenge.The research team led by Associate Professor Lu Jiong, from the NUS Department of Chemistry developed a general and scalable approach for the synthesis of a series of SASCs with tunable high loading via a hydrothermal approach. This allows for the introduction of different molecular precursors including metal salts (M2+), ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate and thioacetamide in a single processing step.The major innovation lies in the creation of operando acidic conditions during synthesis that can suppress the aggregation into metal nanoparticles by the dopant. Using this approach, the dopant is able to disperse themselves as single atoms evenly on the material to achieve high-density substitution, which is important for the proper formation of the spin catalyst and to provide the ferromagnetic effect.This is a collaboration with Professor Xin Luo from Sun Yat-sen University, China, Dr. Shibo Xi from Institute of Sustainability for Chemicals, Energy and Environment, Singapore and Professor Cheng-Hao Chuang from Tamkang University, Taiwan.This research breakthrough was published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.The researchers used molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as the host material and found that the doping ratio can be adjusted by up to 20:100 for the various types of M1/MoS2 SASCs (M1=Mn, Fe, Ni, Co). In general, higher doping density reduces the average spacing between adjacent magnetic dopant sites and increases the long-range magnetic order.      This research work demonstrates the conceptual design and synthesis of a new class of robust ferromagnetic SASCs with giant magnetic field enhancement (MFE), which can be applied to accelerate both water and saline water electrolysis under commonly available magnetic fields.Although MFE effect on chemical reactions has been exploited in homogenous spin catalysis systems as well as in bulk solid catalysts (e.g., mixed oxides and metal), the design of advanced heterogeneous spin catalysts with atomically precise active sites to boost reaction kinetics and to probe its mechanistic insights remain challenging.This is because one must tackle multiple complexities including the ability to engineer well-defined active sites with strong short-range quantum spin exchange interaction (QSEI) within individual sites (local magnetism) and long-range ferromagnetic ordering among neighboring sites (global magnetism).The major novelty of this work goes beyond the synthesis aspect. Joint experimental and theoretical studies show that all the SASCs developed by the researchers exhibit interatomic QSEI to induce local magnetic moments with spin density delocalized over adjacent sulfur atoms via strong p-d orbital hybridization.In their experiments involving the use of the Ni1/MoS2 SASC, a mild magnetic field of around 0.5 tesla (commonly accessible magnetic fields from permanent magnets) when applied, yields a dramatic enhancement of OER magnetocurrent by around 3,000%. It also demonstrated excellent reactivity and stability in both seawater and pure water splitting cells when compared to commercial iridium dioxide (IrO2) catalyst.Assoc Prof Lu said, \"This finding reveals that ferromagnetic SASCs provide a powerful magnetoelectric effect to accelerate water electrolysis. The approach offers unprecedented opportunities for the design of non-precious metal-based ferromagnetic SASCs for both water and saline water electrolyzer technologies.\"\"We plan to work on large-scale synthesis of ferromagnetic single-atom spin catalysts combined with magnetic field to develop solutions that can reduce the cost and improve the efficiency of green hydrogen production from the electrolytic splitting of water and seawater,\" added Assoc Prof Lu.

  "text": "Discovered in 2004, graphene has revolutionized various scientific fields. It possesses remarkable properties like high electron mobility, mechanical strength, and thermal conductivity. Extensive time and effort has been invested in exploring its potential as a next-generation semiconductor material, leading to the development of graphene-based transistors, transparent electrodes, and sensors.          But to render these devices into practical application, it's crucial to have efficient processing techniques that can structure graphene films at micrometer and nanometer scale. Typically, micro/nanoscale material processing and device manufacturing employ nanolithography and focused ion beam methods. However, these have posed longstanding challenges for laboratory researchers due to their need for large-scale equipment, lengthy manufacturing times, and complex operations.In January 2023, Tohoku University researchers created a technique that could micro/nanofabricate silicon nitride devices with thicknesses ranging from five to 50 nanometers. The method employed a femtosecond laser, which emitted extremely short, rapid pulses of light. It turned out to be capable of quickly and conveniently processing thin materials without a vacuum environment.By applying this method to an ultra-thin atomic layer of graphene, the same group has now succeeded in performing multi-point hole drilling without damaging the graphene film. Details of their breakthrough were reported in the journal Nano Letters on May 16, 2023.                (a) Schematic of the laser processing system. (b) Formation of 32 laser spots on the graphene film. (c) Image of a graphene film that has been multi-point hole-drilled. \u00a9Yuuki Uesugi et al.             \"With proper control of the input energy and number of laser shots, we were able to execute precise machining and create holes with diameters ranging from 70 nanometers (much smaller than the laser wavelength of 520 nanometers) to over one millimeter,\" says Yuuki Uesugi, assistant professor at Tohoku University's Institute of Multidisciplinary Research for Advanced Materials, and co-author of the paper.Upon closer examination of the areas irradiated with low-energy laser pulses, which did not make holes, via a high-performance electron microscope, Uesugi and his colleagues found that contaminants on the graphene had also been removed. Further magnified observation revealed nanopores less than 10 nanometers in diameter and atomic-level defects, where several carbon atoms were missing in the crystal structures of the graphene.      Atomic defects in graphene are both detrimental and advantageous, depending on the application. While defects sometimes downgrade certain properties, they also introduce new functionalities or enhance specific characteristics.                Image of laser-processed graphene film observed by scanning transmission electron microscopy. The black areas indicate through-holes. The white objects indicate surface contaminants. \u00a9Yuuki Uesugi et al.             \"Observing a tendency for the density of nanopores and defects to increase proportionally with the energy and number of laser shots led us to conclude the formation of nanopores and defects could be manipulated by using a femtosecond laser irradiation,\" adds Uesugi.\"By forming nanopores and atomic-level defects in graphene, not only can electrical conductivity be controlled but also quantum-level characteristics such as spin and valley. Moreover, the contaminant removal by femtosecond laser irradiation found in this research could develop a new method for non-destructively and cleanly washing high-purity graphene.\"Looking ahead, the team aims to establish a cleaning technique using the laser and carry a detailed investigation into how to conduct atomic defect formation. Further breakthroughs will have a big impact on areas from quantum materials research to biosensor development.

  "text": "Cage structures made with nanoparticles could be a route toward making organized nanostructures with mixed materials, and researchers at the University of Michigan have shown how to achieve this through computer simulations.          The finding could open new avenues for photonic materials that manipulate light in ways that natural crystals can't. It also showcased an unusual effect that the team is calling entropy compartmentalization.\"We are developing new ways to structure matter across scales, discovering the possibilities and what forces we can use,\" said Sharon Glotzer, the Anthony C. Lembke Department Chair of Chemical Engineering, who led the study published today in Nature Chemistry. \"Entropic forces can stabilize even more complex crystals than we thought.\"While entropy is often explained as disorder in a system, it more accurately reflects the system's tendency to maximize its possible states. Often, this ends up as disorder in the colloquial sense. Oxygen molecules don't huddle together in a corner\u2014they spread out to fill a room. But if you put them in the right size box, they will naturally order themselves into a recognizable structure.Nanoparticles do the same thing. Previously, Glotzer's team had shown that bipyramid particles\u2014like two short, three-sided pyramids stuck together at their bases\u2014 will form structures resembling that of fire ice if you put them into a sufficiently small box. Fire ice is made of water molecules that form cages around methane, and it can burn and melt at the same time.Credit: University of MichiganThis substance is found in abundance under the ocean floor and is an example of a clathrate. Clathrate structures are under investigation for a range of applications, such as trapping and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.Unlike water clathrates, earlier nanoparticle clathrate structures had no gaps to fill with other materials that might provide new and interesting possibilities for altering the structure's properties. The team wanted to change that.\"This time, we investigated what happens if we change the shape of the particle. We reasoned that if we truncate the particle a little, it would create space in the cage made by the bipyramid particles,\" said Sangmin Lee, a recent doctoral graduate in chemical engineering and first author of the paper.      He took the three central corners off each bipyramid and discovered the sweet spot where spaces appeared in the structure but the sides of the pyramids were still intact enough that they didn't start organizing in a different way. The spaces filled in with more truncated bipyramids when they were the only particle in the system. When a second shape was added, that shape became the trapped guest particle.Glotzer has ideas for how to create selectively sticky sides that would enable different materials to act as cage and guest particles, but in this case, there was no glue holding the bipyramids together. Instead, the structure was completely stabilized by entropy.\"What's really fascinating, looking at the simulations, is that the host network is almost frozen. The host particles move, but they all move together like a single, rigid object, which is exactly what happens with water clathrates,\" Glotzer said. \"But the guest particles are spinning around like crazy\u2014like the system dumped all the entropy into the guest particles.\"This was the system with the most degrees of freedom that the truncated bipyramids could build in a limited space, but nearly all the freedom belonged to the guest particles. Methane in water clathrates rotates too, the researchers say. What's more, when they removed the guest particles, the structure threw bipyramids that had been part of the networked cage structure into the cage interiors\u2014it was more important to have spinning particles available to maximize the entropy than to have complete cages.\"Entropy compartmentalization. Isn't that cool? I bet that happens in other systems too\u2014not just clathrates,\" Glotzer said.

In the classic film Fantastic Voyage, a group of adventurers travels via a shrunken-down submarine into the body of a man in a coma.\"The movie was released in 1966. Today, we are living in an era of micrometer- and nanometer-scale robots,\" Lee said.                Microrobot seen under a scanning electron microscope. Credit: Shields Lab             He imagines that, just like in the movie, microrobots could swirl through a person's blood stream, seeking out targeted areas to treat for various ailments.The team makes its microrobots out of materials called biocompatible polymers using a technology similar to 3D printing. The machines look a bit like small rockets and come complete with three tiny fins. They also include a little something extra: Each of the robots carries a small bubble of trapped air, similar to what happens when you dunk a glass upside-down in water. If you expose the machines to an acoustic field, like the kind used in ultrasound, the bubbles will begin to vibrate wildly, pushing water away and shooting the robots forward.Other CU Boulder co-authors of the new study include Nick Bottenus, assistant professor of mechanical engineering; Ankur Gupta, assistant professor of chemical and biological engineering; and engineering graduate students Ritu Raj, Cooper Thome, Nicole Day and Payton Martinez.To take their microrobots for a test drive, the researchers set their sights on a common problem for humans: bladder disease.      Bringing reliefInterstitial cystitis, also known as painful bladder syndrome, affects millions of Americans and, as its name suggests, can cause severe pelvic pain. Treating the disease can be equally uncomfortable. Often, patients have to come into a clinic several times over a period of weeks where a doctor injects a harsh solution of dexamethasone into the bladder through a catheter.Lee believes that microrobots may be able to provide some relief.In laboratory experiments, the researchers fabricated schools of microrobots encapsulating high concentrations of dexamethasone. They then introduced thousands of those bots into the bladders of lab mice. The result was a real-life Fantastic Voyage: The microrobots dispersed through the organs before sticking onto the bladder walls, which would likely make them difficult to pee out.Once there, the machines slowly released their dexamethasone over the course of about two days. Such a steady flow of medicine could allow patients to receive more drugs over a longer span of time, Lee said, improving outcomes for patients.He added that the team has a lot of work to do before microrobots can travel through real human bodies. For a start, the group wants to make the machines fully biodegradable so that they would eventually dissolve in the body.\"If we can make these particles work in the bladder,\" Lee said, \"then we can achieve a more sustained drug release, and maybe patients wouldn't have to come into the clinic as often.\" More information:Jin Gyun Lee et al, Bubble\u2010Based Microrobots with Rapid Circular Motions for Epithelial Pinning and Drug Delivery, Small (2023).

  "text": "When designing optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells, photocatalysts, and photodetectors, scientists usually prioritize materials that are stable and possess tunable properties. This allows them precise control over optical characteristics of the materials and ensures retention of their properties over time, despite varying environmental conditions.          Organic-inorganic nanohybrids, which are made up of organic ligands attached to the surface of colloidal inorganic nanocrystals via coordinate bonds, are promising in this regard. They are known to exhibit enhanced stability owing to the formation of a protective layer by organic ligands around the reactive inorganic nanocrystal. However, the incorporation of organic ligands has been found to lower the conductivity and photon absorption efficiency of inorganic nanocrystals.In a breakthrough study on ligand-nanocrystal interactions, researchers from Japan now demonstrate a quasi-reversible displacement of organic ligands on the surface of nanocrystals. Their findings, published in ACS Nano, provide a new perspective to the common belief that the organic ligands are anchored to the surface of the nanocrystals.The research team, led by Professor Yoichi Kobayashi from Ritsumeikan University, Japan, found that the coordination bond between perylene bisimide with a carboxyl group (PBI) and inorganic zinc sulfide (ZnS) nanocrystals can be reversibly displaced by exposing the material to visible light.Shedding light on this novel behavior of organic-inorganic nanohybrids, Prof. Kobayashi says, \"We explored the ligand properties of organic-inorganic nanohybrid systems by using perylene bisimide with a carboxyl group (PBI)-coordinated zinc sulfide (ZnS) NCs (PBI\u2013ZnS) as a model system. Our findings provide the first example of photoinduced displacement of aromatic ligands with semiconductor nanocrystals.\"In their study, the researchers carried out both theoretical analysis and experimental investigations to understand the material's unique photoinducible characteristics. They first conducted density functional theory calculations to study the structure and orbitals of PBI\u2013ZnS ([PBI-Zn25S31]-) in both its ground and first excited states.Next, they performed time-resolved impulsive stimulated Raman spectroscopy to excite the sample with an ultrafast laser. This helped them analyze the corresponding Raman spectrum that revealed the nature of the excited state of PBI\u2013ZnS.The experimental observations and calculations showed that, upon photoexcitation, an electron is excited from the PBI molecule, and the corresponding \"hole\"(the vacancy formed due to the absence of the electron) rapidly moves from the aromatic ligand (PBI) to ZnS. This results in a long-lived, negatively-charged PBI ion that is displaced from the surface of the ZnS nanocrystal.Over time, however, the displaced ligands recombine with the surface defects of the ZnS nanocrystal, leading to a quasi-reversible photoinduced displacement of coordinated PBI. Notably, the dynamic behavior of coordinated ligand molecules observed in this study is different from that observed for typical photoinduced charge transfer processes in which the hole typically remains on the donor molecule, enabling it to recombine with the electron quickly.Explaining the significance of these findings, Prof. Kobayashi says, \"The precise understanding of ligand-nanocrystal interaction is important not only for fundamental nanoscience but also for developing advanced photofunctional materials using nanomaterials. These include photocatalysts for the decomposition of persistent chemicals using visible light and photoconductive microcircuit patterning for wearable devices.\"Indeed, the results of this study present a promising avenue for enhancing the tunability and functionality of inorganic materials with aromatic molecules. This, in turn, could significantly impact the field of fundamental nanoscience and photochemistry in the times to come.

  "text": "Particles known as extracellular vesicles play a vital role in communication between cells and in many cell functions. Released by cells into their environment, these \"membrane particles\" consist of a cellular membrane carrying a cargo of specific signaling molecules, proteins, nucleic acids and lipids. Unfortunately, only tiny quantities of the vesicles are formed spontaneously by cells.          The contents of these extracellular vesicles vary depending on the origin and condition of the cell, as do the proteins that are anchored to the vesicle surface. Researchers use these properties to develop new techniques for diagnosing cancer, for example, based on the analysis of extracellular vesicles isolated from blood samples.Extracellular vesicles could also play a key role in the development of next-generation therapeutics. As the vesicles are of natural origin, they are biocompatible and can trigger a wide range of different reactions in the body.Researchers therefore hope to use the particles to influence the immune system\u2014for example, in order to destroy cancer cells. Until now, however, one major challenge has been the reproducible production of the large quantities of homogeneous vesicles needed for such studies.A faster route to more particlesNow, a team of researchers led by Professor J\u00f6rg Huwyler from the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and the Swiss Nanoscience Institute (SNI) of the University of Basel has developed a highly efficient preparation method for extracellular vesicles that delivers up to 100 times more particles per cell and hour than conventional methods. They describe the new method in the journal Communications Biology.Credit: Swiss Nanoscience Institute, University of Basel\"We start the preparation process by cultivating cancer cells, in which we induce cell death by adding chemical stressors,\" explains Claudio Alter, first author of the study and a doctoral student at the SNI Ph.D. School. \"The cells then form vesicles, which detach from the parent cell after a few hours.\"With a diameter of 1 to 3 micrometers, these giant plasma membrane vesicles are far too big for therapeutic applications. In the newly developed process, they are therefore pressed through a filter membrane multiple times in order to reduce their size. \"After multiple filter passes, we obtain a homogeneous solution of nano plasma membrane vesicles (nPMV) with a diameter of 120 nanometers\u2014precisely what we need for subsequent applications,\" explains Alter.Different origin, different applicationsThe team of researchers then characterized these nPMVs and compared their size, homogeneity, and protein and lipid cargo with those of exosomes\u2014currently the most commonly used extracellular vesicles. They also investigated how well the nPMVs interact with other cells. In these analyses, the nano plasma membrane vesicles showed similar properties to exosomes.\"Their specific cargo and the presence of membrane-bound markers derived from the parent cell line offers the possibility to use nPMVs for therapeutic purposes,\" says J\u00f6rg Huwyler. \"At present, we're primarily thinking of a stimulation of the immune system\u2014for example, in vaccination or in immunotherapy treatments for cancer.\" More information:Claudio L.

To address the problem, Rice University engineers have developed minimally invasive, ultraflexible nanoelectrodes that could serve as an implanted platform for administering long-term, high-resolution stimulation therapy.According to a study published in Cell Reports, the tiny implantable devices formed stable, long-lasting and seamless tissue-electrode interfaces with minimal scarring or degradation in rodents. The devices delivered electrical pulses that match neuronal signaling patterns and amplitudes more closely than stimuli from conventional intracortical electrodes.The devices' high biocompatibility and precise spatiotemporal stimulus control could enable the development of new brain stimulation therapies such as neuronal prostheses for patients with impaired sensory or motor functions.\"This paper uses imaging, behavioral and histological techniques to show how these tissue-integrated electrodes improve the efficacy of stimulation,\" said Lan Luan, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering and a corresponding author on the study. \"Our electrode delivers tiny electrical pulses to excite neural activity in a very controllable manner.\"We were able to reduce the current necessary to elicit neuronal activation by more than an order of magnitude. Pulses can be as subtle as a couple hundred microseconds in duration and one or two microamps in amplitude.\"The new electrode design developed by researchers in the Rice Neuroengineering Initiative represents a significant improvement over conventional implantable electrodes used to treat conditions such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and obsessive-compulsive disorder, which can cause adverse tissue responses and unintended changes in neural activity.\"Conventional electrodes are very invasive,\" said Chong Xie, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering and a corresponding author of the study. \"They recruit thousands or even millions of neurons at a time.\"\"Each of those neurons is supposed to have their own tune and coordinate in a specific pattern. But when you shock them all at the same time, you're basically disrupting their function. In some cases that works fine for you and has the desired therapeutic effect. But if, for example, you want to encode sensory information, you need much greater control over the stimuli.\"Xie likened stimulation via conventional electrodes with the disruptive effect of \"blowing an airhorn in everyone's ear or having a loudspeaker blaring\" in a roomful of people.\"We used to have this very big loudspeaker, and now everyone has an earpiece,\" he said.The ability to adjust the frequency, duration and intensity of the signals could enable the development of novel sensory prosthetic devices.\"Neuron activation is more diffuse if you use a larger current,\" Luan said. \"We were able to reduce the current and showed that we have a much more focused activation. This can translate to higher-resolution stimulation devices.\"Luan and Xie are core members of the Rice Neuroengineering Initiative and their labs are also collaborating on the development of an implantable visual prosthetic device for blind patients.\"Envision one day being able to implant electrode arrays to restore impaired sensory function: The more focused and deliberate is the activation of the neurons, the more precise the sensation you're generating,\" Luan said.An earlier iteration of the devices was used to record brain activity.\"We have had a series of publications showing this intimate tissue integration enabled by our electrode's ultraflexible design really improves our ability to record brain activity for longer durations and with better signal-to-noise ratios,\" said Luan, who has been promoted to associate professor effective July 1.

  "text": "Diagnosing and treating gastrointestinal tract diseases can be notoriously invasive and time-consuming: blood and stool lab work; biopsies, colonoscopies and endoscopies; and X-rays, CT scans and MRI imaging. But what if there was an alternative as simple as popping a Bayer aspirin?          Researchers in the University of Maryland's MEMS Sensors and Actuators Laboratory (MSAL) in the A. James Clark School of Engineering have developed an ingestible capsule with a new packaging technology that can protect its tiny components in the sometimes harsh environment of the GI tract, then dissolve at precise moments and locations needed to deliver drugs, reveal sensors or carry out other functions.Their study, published in Microsystems & Nanoengineering, describes how this packaging, called a freestanding region-responsive bilayer (FRRB), can protect the capsule as it navigates the GI tract and performs complex diagnostic and therapeutic tasks like sensing, monitoring and drug delivery.\"Ingestible capsule devices are the next frontier of medical technology,\" said bioengineering Ph.D. student Michael Straker, first author of the paper. \"The FRRB is a simple yet elegant solution to one of the major challenges of developing these devices. It can be used to develop creative new designs, allowing sensitive actuators and sensors to reach targeted regions of the GI tract unscathed.\"Co-authors on the paper include materials science and engineering Ph.D. student Joshua Levy, electrical and computer engineering Ph.D. candidate Justin Stine, Vivian Borbash '22, research associate Luke Beardslee and Herbert Rabin Distinguished Chair in Engineering Reza Ghodssi, who directs the MSAL.Their work focuses on addressing autoimmune disorders like inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and affects more than 3 million Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It also could eventually be useful for conditions involving gut-brain connections, such as depression.For many years, pharmaceutical companies have relied on pH-responsive materials, commonly known as an \"enteric\" coating, to deliver drugs into the body; it is used in the daily aspirin that many people take for heart health. But enteric coatings aren't sophisticated enough to protect an ingestible capsule from the acidic fluids and solids it encounters as it journeys through the GI tract en route to the intended destination: the intestines. It has to remain intact so that the components, such as the sensor or the drug, can be uncovered and released at the right time.One idea that has been tried is adding an opening mechanism to the capsule. However, such mechanisms can be bulky and add complexity and weight to the device. They also may require stimulus from beyond the capsule, through high-powered equipment.The FRRB developed by MSAL, a research group focused on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) with a long history of groundbreaking research into ingestible capsules, is a more versatile option. It can be readily applied to various ingestible capsule components, can be fabricated into a number of shapes, and can protect those fragile components within the GI tract until they reach their intended destination, then dissolve away so they can perform the functions for which they were designed, in sequential order.\"It is our expectation that this manufacturing approach will widen the design paradigm of developing minimally invasive micro/nano/bio devices and systems for health care monitoring, treatment and prevention applications,\" said Ghodssi.

  "text": "Infections caused by fungi, such as Candida albicans, pose a significant global health risk due to their resistance to existing treatments, so much so that the World Health Organization has highlighted this as a priority issue.          Although nanomaterials show promise as antifungal agents, current iterations lack the potency and specificity needed for quick and targeted treatment, leading to prolonged treatment times and potential off-target effects and drug resistance.Now, in a groundbreaking development with far-reaching implications for global health, a team of researchers jointly led by Hyun (Michel) Koo of the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine and Edward Steager of Penn's School of Engineering and Applied Science has created a microrobotic system capable of rapid, targeted elimination of fungal pathogens.\"Candidae forms tenacious biofilm infections that are particularly hard to treat,\" Koo says. \"Current antifungal therapies lack the potency and specificity required to quickly and effectively eliminate these pathogens, so this collaboration draws from our clinical knowledge and combines Ed's team and their robotic expertise to offer a new approach.\"The team of researchers is a part of Penn Dental's Center for Innovation & Precision Dentistry, an initiative that leverages engineering and computational approaches to uncover new knowledge for disease mitigation and advance oral and craniofacial health care innovation.For this paper, published in Advanced Materials, the researchers capitalized on recent advancements in catalytic nanoparticles, known as nanozymes, and they built miniature robotic systems that could accurately target and quickly destroy fungal cells. They achieved this by using electromagnetic fields to control the shape and movements of these nanozyme microrobots with great precision.\"The methods we use to control the nanoparticles in this study are magnetic, which allows us to direct them to the exact infection location,\" Steager says. \"We use iron oxide nanoparticles, which have another important property, namely that they're catalytic.\"                Electromagnetic cores precisely guide the array of nanozyme-bots as they target the site of fungal infection. Credit: Min Jun Oh and Seokyoung Yoon             Steager's team developed the motion, velocity, and formations of nanozymes, which resulted in enhanced catalytic activity, much like the enzyme peroxidase, which helps break down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. This directly allows the generation of high amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), compounds that have proven biofilm-destroying properties, at the site of infection.      However, the truly pioneering element of these nanozyme assemblies was an unexpected discovery: their strong binding affinity to fungal cells. This feature enables a localized accumulation of nanozymes precisely where the fungi reside and, consequently, targeted ROS generation. \"Our nanozyme assemblies show an incredible attraction to fungal cells, particularly when compared to human cells,\" Steager says. \"This specific binding interaction paves the way for a potent and concentrated antifungal effect without affecting other uninfected areas.\"Coupled with the nanozyme's inherent maneuverability, this results in a potent antifungal effect, demonstrating the rapid eradication of fungal cells within an unprecedented 10-minute window.Looking forward, the team sees the potential of this unique nanozyme-based robotics approach, as they incorporate new methods to automate control and delivery of nanozymes. The promise it holds for antifungal therapy is just the beginning. Its precise targeting, rapid action suggest potential for treating other types of stubborn infections.\"We've uncovered a powerful tool in the fight against pathogenic fungal infections,\" Koo says. \"What we have achieved here is a significant leap forward, but it's also just the first step. The magnetic and catalytic properties combined with unexpected binding specificity to fungi open exciting opportunities for an automated 'target-bind-and-kill' antifungal mechanism. We are eager to delve deeper and unlock its full potential.\"This robotics approach opens up a new frontier in the fight against fungal infections and marks a pivotal point in antifungal therapy.

  "text": "The first protein-based nano-computing agent that functions as a circuit has been created by Penn State researchers. The milestone puts them one step closer to developing next-generation cell-based therapies to treat diseases like diabetes and cancer.          Traditional synthetic biology approaches for cell-based therapies, such as ones that destroy cancer cells or encourage tissue regeneration after injury, rely on the expression or suppression of proteins that produce a desired action within a cell. This approach can take time (for proteins to be expressed and degrade) and cost cellular energy in the process. A team of Penn State College of Medicine and Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences researchers are taking a different approach.\"We're engineering proteins that directly produce a desired action,\" said Nikolay Dokholyan, G. Thomas Passananti Professor and vice chair for research in the Department of Pharmacology. \"Our protein-based devices or nano-computing agents respond directly to stimuli (inputs) and then produce a desired action (outputs).\"In a study published in Science Advances, Dokholyan and bioinformatics and genomics doctoral student Jiaxing Chen describe their approach to creating their nano-computing agent. They engineered a target protein by integrating two sensor domains, or areas that respond to stimuli. In this case, the target protein responds to light and a drug called rapamycin by adjusting its orientation, or position in space.To test their design, the team introduced their engineered protein into live cells in culture. By exposing the cultured cells to the stimuli, they used equipment to measure changes in cellular orientation after cells were exposed to the sensor domains' stimuli.                Jiaxing Chen, a bioinformatics and genomics doctoral student at Penn State College of Medicine and Penn State Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences, is part of the Penn State research team to create the first protein-based nano-computing agent that functions as a circuit. Credit: Penn State Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences             Previously, their nano-computing agent required two inputs to produce one output. Now, Chen says there are two possible outputs and the output depends on which order the inputs are received. If rapamycin is detected first, followed by light, the cell will adopt one angle of cell orientation, but if the stimuli are received in a reverse order, then the cell adopts a different orientation angle. Chen says this experimental proof-of-concept opens the door for the development of more complex nano-computing agents.\"Theoretically, the more inputs you embed into a nano-computing agent, the more potential outcomes that could result from different combinations,\" Chen said. \"Potential inputs could include physical or chemical stimuli and outputs could include changes in cellular behaviors, such as cell direction, migration, modifying gene expression and immune cell cytotoxicity against cancer cells.\"The team plans to further develop their nano-computing agents and experiment with different applications of the technology. Dokholyan, a researcher with Penn State Cancer Institute and Penn State Neuroscience Institute, said their concept could someday form the basis of the next-generation cell-based therapies for various diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, viral infections, diabetes, nerve injury and cancer.Yashavantha Vishweshwaraiah, Richard Mailman and Erdem Tabdanov of Penn State College of Medicine also contributed to this research.

  "text": "Chemists from the National University of Singapore (NUS) have developed a scalable hydrothermal approach for obtaining ferromagnetic single-atom spin catalysts which can boost the efficiency of water splitting reactions under the influence of a magnetic field.          Electrolysis of water using renewable resources is a promising technology for hydrogen production and is having a growing interest worldwide. This is because hydrogen is seen as a promising alternative to address the increasing concerns over carbon emissions from fossil fuels that can cause climate change.However, hydrogen production via water electrolysis is primarily limited by the sluggish kinetics of an associated process known as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Precious metal based electrocatalysts are often used in the OER process to improve its poor efficiency. A pioneering class of catalytic materials known as heterogeneous ferromagnetic single-atom spin catalysts (SASCs), when used together with an applied magnetic field has great potential to accelerate this chemical reaction.However, the design of such efficient and robust SASCs for the OER process is still recognized as a major challenge.The research team led by Associate Professor Lu Jiong, from the NUS Department of Chemistry developed a general and scalable approach for the synthesis of a series of SASCs with tunable high loading via a hydrothermal approach. This allows for the introduction of different molecular precursors including metal salts (M2+), ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate and thioacetamide in a single processing step.The major innovation lies in the creation of operando acidic conditions during synthesis that can suppress the aggregation into metal nanoparticles by the dopant. Using this approach, the dopant is able to disperse themselves as single atoms evenly on the material to achieve high-density substitution, which is important for the proper formation of the spin catalyst and to provide the ferromagnetic effect.This is a collaboration with Professor Xin Luo from Sun Yat-sen University, China, Dr. Shibo Xi from Institute of Sustainability for Chemicals, Energy and Environment, Singapore and Professor Cheng-Hao Chuang from Tamkang University, Taiwan.This research breakthrough was published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.The researchers used molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as the host material and found that the doping ratio can be adjusted by up to 20:100 for the various types of M1/MoS2 SASCs (M1=Mn, Fe, Ni, Co). In general, higher doping density reduces the average spacing between adjacent magnetic dopant sites and increases the long-range magnetic order.      This research work demonstrates the conceptual design and synthesis of a new class of robust ferromagnetic SASCs with giant magnetic field enhancement (MFE), which can be applied to accelerate both water and saline water electrolysis under commonly available magnetic fields.Although MFE effect on chemical reactions has been exploited in homogenous spin catalysis systems as well as in bulk solid catalysts (e.g., mixed oxides and metal), the design of advanced heterogeneous spin catalysts with atomically precise active sites to boost reaction kinetics and to probe its mechanistic insights remain challenging.This is because one must tackle multiple complexities including the ability to engineer well-defined active sites with strong short-range quantum spin exchange interaction (QSEI) within individual sites (local magnetism) and long-range ferromagnetic ordering among neighboring sites (global magnetism).The major novelty of this work goes beyond the synthesis aspect. Joint experimental and theoretical studies show that all the SASCs developed by the researchers exhibit interatomic QSEI to induce local magnetic moments with spin density delocalized over adjacent sulfur atoms via strong p-d orbital hybridization.In their experiments involving the use of the Ni1/MoS2 SASC, a mild magnetic field of around 0.5 tesla (commonly accessible magnetic fields from permanent magnets) when applied, yields a dramatic enhancement of OER magnetocurrent by around 3,000%. It also demonstrated excellent reactivity and stability in both seawater and pure water splitting cells when compared to commercial iridium dioxide (IrO2) catalyst.Assoc Prof Lu said, \"This finding reveals that ferromagnetic SASCs provide a powerful magnetoelectric effect to accelerate water electrolysis.

  "text": "Discovered in 2004, graphene has revolutionized various scientific fields. It possesses remarkable properties like high electron mobility, mechanical strength, and thermal conductivity. Extensive time and effort has been invested in exploring its potential as a next-generation semiconductor material, leading to the development of graphene-based transistors, transparent electrodes, and sensors.          But to render these devices into practical application, it's crucial to have efficient processing techniques that can structure graphene films at micrometer and nanometer scale. Typically, micro/nanoscale material processing and device manufacturing employ nanolithography and focused ion beam methods. However, these have posed longstanding challenges for laboratory researchers due to their need for large-scale equipment, lengthy manufacturing times, and complex operations.In January 2023, Tohoku University researchers created a technique that could micro/nanofabricate silicon nitride devices with thicknesses ranging from five to 50 nanometers. The method employed a femtosecond laser, which emitted extremely short, rapid pulses of light. It turned out to be capable of quickly and conveniently processing thin materials without a vacuum environment.By applying this method to an ultra-thin atomic layer of graphene, the same group has now succeeded in performing multi-point hole drilling without damaging the graphene film. Details of their breakthrough were reported in the journal Nano Letters on May 16, 2023.                (a) Schematic of the laser processing system. (b) Formation of 32 laser spots on the graphene film. (c) Image of a graphene film that has been multi-point hole-drilled. \u00a9Yuuki Uesugi et al.             \"With proper control of the input energy and number of laser shots, we were able to execute precise machining and create holes with diameters ranging from 70 nanometers (much smaller than the laser wavelength of 520 nanometers) to over one millimeter,\" says Yuuki Uesugi, assistant professor at Tohoku University's Institute of Multidisciplinary Research for Advanced Materials, and co-author of the paper.Upon closer examination of the areas irradiated with low-energy laser pulses, which did not make holes, via a high-performance electron microscope, Uesugi and his colleagues found that contaminants on the graphene had also been removed. Further magnified observation revealed nanopores less than 10 nanometers in diameter and atomic-level defects, where several carbon atoms were missing in the crystal structures of the graphene.      Atomic defects in graphene are both detrimental and advantageous, depending on the application. While defects sometimes downgrade certain properties, they also introduce new functionalities or enhance specific characteristics.                Image of laser-processed graphene film observed by scanning transmission electron microscopy. The black areas indicate through-holes. The white objects indicate surface contaminants. \u00a9Yuuki Uesugi et al.             \"Observing a tendency for the density of nanopores and defects to increase proportionally with the energy and number of laser shots led us to conclude the formation of nanopores and defects could be manipulated by using a femtosecond laser irradiation,\" adds Uesugi.\"By forming nanopores and atomic-level defects in graphene, not only can electrical conductivity be controlled but also quantum-level characteristics such as spin and valley. Moreover, the contaminant removal by femtosecond laser irradiation found in this research could develop a new method for non-destructively and cleanly washing high-purity graphene.\"Looking ahead, the team aims to establish a cleaning technique using the laser and carry a detailed investigation into how to conduct atomic defect formation. Further breakthroughs will have a big impact on areas from quantum materials research to biosensor development.

  "text": "Cage structures made with nanoparticles could be a route toward making organized nanostructures with mixed materials, and researchers at the University of Michigan have shown how to achieve this through computer simulations.          The finding could open new avenues for photonic materials that manipulate light in ways that natural crystals can't. It also showcased an unusual effect that the team is calling entropy compartmentalization.\"We are developing new ways to structure matter across scales, discovering the possibilities and what forces we can use,\" said Sharon Glotzer, the Anthony C. Lembke Department Chair of Chemical Engineering, who led the study published today in Nature Chemistry. \"Entropic forces can stabilize even more complex crystals than we thought.\"While entropy is often explained as disorder in a system, it more accurately reflects the system's tendency to maximize its possible states. Often, this ends up as disorder in the colloquial sense. Oxygen molecules don't huddle together in a corner\u2014they spread out to fill a room. But if you put them in the right size box, they will naturally order themselves into a recognizable structure.Nanoparticles do the same thing. Previously, Glotzer's team had shown that bipyramid particles\u2014like two short, three-sided pyramids stuck together at their bases\u2014 will form structures resembling that of fire ice if you put them into a sufficiently small box. Fire ice is made of water molecules that form cages around methane, and it can burn and melt at the same time.Credit: University of MichiganThis substance is found in abundance under the ocean floor and is an example of a clathrate. Clathrate structures are under investigation for a range of applications, such as trapping and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.Unlike water clathrates, earlier nanoparticle clathrate structures had no gaps to fill with other materials that might provide new and interesting possibilities for altering the structure's properties. The team wanted to change that.\"This time, we investigated what happens if we change the shape of the particle. We reasoned that if we truncate the particle a little, it would create space in the cage made by the bipyramid particles,\" said Sangmin Lee, a recent doctoral graduate in chemical engineering and first author of the paper.      He took the three central corners off each bipyramid and discovered the sweet spot where spaces appeared in the structure but the sides of the pyramids were still intact enough that they didn't start organizing in a different way. The spaces filled in with more truncated bipyramids when they were the only particle in the system. When a second shape was added, that shape became the trapped guest particle.Glotzer has ideas for how to create selectively sticky sides that would enable different materials to act as cage and guest particles, but in this case, there was no glue holding the bipyramids together. Instead, the structure was completely stabilized by entropy.\"What's really fascinating, looking at the simulations, is that the host network is almost frozen. The host particles move, but they all move together like a single, rigid object, which is exactly what happens with water clathrates,\" Glotzer said. \"But the guest particles are spinning around like crazy\u2014like the system dumped all the entropy into the guest particles.\"This was the system with the most degrees of freedom that the truncated bipyramids could build in a limited space, but nearly all the freedom belonged to the guest particles. Methane in water clathrates rotates too, the researchers say. What's more, when they removed the guest particles, the structure threw bipyramids that had been part of the networked cage structure into the cage interiors\u2014it was more important to have spinning particles available to maximize the entropy than to have complete cages.\"Entropy compartmentalization. Isn't that cool? I bet that happens in other systems too\u2014not just clathrates,\" Glotzer said.

  "text": "A team of engineers at the University of Colorado Boulder has designed a new class of tiny, self-propelled robots that can zip through liquid at incredible speeds\u2014and may one day even deliver prescription drugs to hard-to-reach places inside the human body.          The researchers describe their mini healthcare providers in a paper published last month in the journal Small.\"Imagine if microrobots could perform certain tasks in the body, such as non-invasive surgeries,\" said Jin Lee, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering. \"Instead of cutting into the patient, we can simply introduce the robots to the body through a pill or an injection, and they would perform the procedure themselves.\"Lee and his colleagues aren't there yet, but the new research is big step forward for tiny robots.The group's microrobots are really small. Each one measures only 20 micrometers wide, several times smaller than the width of a human hair. They're also really fast, capable of traveling at speeds of about 3 millimeters per second, or roughly 9,000 times their own length per minute. That's many times faster than a cheetah in relative terms.They have a lot of potential, too. In the new study, the group deployed fleets of these machines to transport doses of dexamethasone, a common steroid medication, to the bladders of lab mice. The results suggest that microrobots may be a useful tool for treating bladder diseases and other illnesses in people.\"Microscale robots have garnered a lot of excitement in scientific circles, but what makes them interesting to us is that we can design them to perform useful tasks in the body,\" said C. Wyatt Shields, a co-author of the new study and assistant professor of chemical and biological engineering.Fantastic VoyageIf that sounds like something ripped from science fiction, that's because it is. In the classic film Fantastic Voyage, a group of adventurers travels via a shrunken-down submarine into the body of a man in a coma.\"The movie was released in 1966. Today, we are living in an era of micrometer- and nanometer-scale robots,\" Lee said.                Microrobot seen under a scanning electron microscope. Credit: Shields Lab             He imagines that, just like in the movie, microrobots could swirl through a person's blood stream, seeking out targeted areas to treat for various ailments.The team makes its microrobots out of materials called biocompatible polymers using a technology similar to 3D printing. The machines look a bit like small rockets and come complete with three tiny fins. They also include a little something extra: Each of the robots carries a small bubble of trapped air, similar to what happens when you dunk a glass upside-down in water. If you expose the machines to an acoustic field, like the kind used in ultrasound, the bubbles will begin to vibrate wildly, pushing water away and shooting the robots forward.Other CU Boulder co-authors of the new study include Nick Bottenus, assistant professor of mechanical engineering; Ankur Gupta, assistant professor of chemical and biological engineering; and engineering graduate students Ritu Raj, Cooper Thome, Nicole Day and Payton Martinez.To take their microrobots for a test drive, the researchers set their sights on a common problem for humans: bladder disease.      Bringing reliefInterstitial cystitis, also known as painful bladder syndrome, affects millions of Americans and, as its name suggests, can cause severe pelvic pain. Treating the disease can be equally uncomfortable. Often, patients have to come into a clinic several times over a period of weeks where a doctor injects a harsh solution of dexamethasone into the bladder through a catheter.Lee believes that microrobots may be able to provide some relief.In laboratory experiments, the researchers fabricated schools of microrobots encapsulating high concentrations of dexamethasone. They then introduced thousands of those bots into the bladders of lab mice. The result was a real-life Fantastic Voyage: The microrobots dispersed through the organs before sticking onto the bladder walls, which would likely make them difficult to pee out.Once there, the machines slowly released their dexamethasone over the course of about two days. Such a steady flow of medicine could allow patients to receive more drugs over a longer span of time, Lee said, improving outcomes for patients.He added that the team has a lot of work to do before microrobots can travel through real human bodies. For a start, the group wants to make the machines fully biodegradable so that they would eventually dissolve in the body.\"If we can make these particles work in the bladder,\" Lee said, \"then we can achieve a more sustained drug release, and maybe patients wouldn't have to come into the clinic as often.\" More information:Jin Gyun Lee et al, Bubble\u2010Based Microrobots with Rapid Circular Motions for Epithelial Pinning and Drug Delivery, Small (2023).

  "text": "When designing optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells, photocatalysts, and photodetectors, scientists usually prioritize materials that are stable and possess tunable properties. This allows them precise control over optical characteristics of the materials and ensures retention of their properties over time, despite varying environmental conditions.          Organic-inorganic nanohybrids, which are made up of organic ligands attached to the surface of colloidal inorganic nanocrystals via coordinate bonds, are promising in this regard. They are known to exhibit enhanced stability owing to the formation of a protective layer by organic ligands around the reactive inorganic nanocrystal. However, the incorporation of organic ligands has been found to lower the conductivity and photon absorption efficiency of inorganic nanocrystals.In a breakthrough study on ligand-nanocrystal interactions, researchers from Japan now demonstrate a quasi-reversible displacement of organic ligands on the surface of nanocrystals. Their findings, published in ACS Nano, provide a new perspective to the common belief that the organic ligands are anchored to the surface of the nanocrystals.The research team, led by Professor Yoichi Kobayashi from Ritsumeikan University, Japan, found that the coordination bond between perylene bisimide with a carboxyl group (PBI) and inorganic zinc sulfide (ZnS) nanocrystals can be reversibly displaced by exposing the material to visible light.Shedding light on this novel behavior of organic-inorganic nanohybrids, Prof. Kobayashi says, \"We explored the ligand properties of organic-inorganic nanohybrid systems by using perylene bisimide with a carboxyl group (PBI)-coordinated zinc sulfide (ZnS) NCs (PBI\u2013ZnS) as a model system. Our findings provide the first example of photoinduced displacement of aromatic ligands with semiconductor nanocrystals.\"In their study, the researchers carried out both theoretical analysis and experimental investigations to understand the material's unique photoinducible characteristics. They first conducted density functional theory calculations to study the structure and orbitals of PBI\u2013ZnS ([PBI-Zn25S31]-) in both its ground and first excited states.Next, they performed time-resolved impulsive stimulated Raman spectroscopy to excite the sample with an ultrafast laser. This helped them analyze the corresponding Raman spectrum that revealed the nature of the excited state of PBI\u2013ZnS.The experimental observations and calculations showed that, upon photoexcitation, an electron is excited from the PBI molecule, and the corresponding \"hole\"(the vacancy formed due to the absence of the electron) rapidly moves from the aromatic ligand (PBI) to ZnS. This results in a long-lived, negatively-charged PBI ion that is displaced from the surface of the ZnS nanocrystal.Over time, however, the displaced ligands recombine with the surface defects of the ZnS nanocrystal, leading to a quasi-reversible photoinduced displacement of coordinated PBI. Notably, the dynamic behavior of coordinated ligand molecules observed in this study is different from that observed for typical photoinduced charge transfer processes in which the hole typically remains on the donor molecule, enabling it to recombine with the electron quickly.Explaining the significance of these findings, Prof. Kobayashi says, \"The precise understanding of ligand-nanocrystal interaction is important not only for fundamental nanoscience but also for developing advanced photofunctional materials using nanomaterials. These include photocatalysts for the decomposition of persistent chemicals using visible light and photoconductive microcircuit patterning for wearable devices.\"Indeed, the results of this study present a promising avenue for enhancing the tunability and functionality of inorganic materials with aromatic molecules. This, in turn, could significantly impact the field of fundamental nanoscience and photochemistry in the times to come.

  "answer_squad": " 120 nanometers",
  "text": "Particles known as extracellular vesicles play a vital role in communication between cells and in many cell functions. Released by cells into their environment, these \"membrane particles\" consist of a cellular membrane carrying a cargo of specific signaling molecules, proteins, nucleic acids and lipids. Unfortunately, only tiny quantities of the vesicles are formed spontaneously by cells.          The contents of these extracellular vesicles vary depending on the origin and condition of the cell, as do the proteins that are anchored to the vesicle surface. Researchers use these properties to develop new techniques for diagnosing cancer, for example, based on the analysis of extracellular vesicles isolated from blood samples.Extracellular vesicles could also play a key role in the development of next-generation therapeutics. As the vesicles are of natural origin, they are biocompatible and can trigger a wide range of different reactions in the body.Researchers therefore hope to use the particles to influence the immune system\u2014for example, in order to destroy cancer cells. Until now, however, one major challenge has been the reproducible production of the large quantities of homogeneous vesicles needed for such studies.A faster route to more particlesNow, a team of researchers led by Professor J\u00f6rg Huwyler from the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and the Swiss Nanoscience Institute (SNI) of the University of Basel has developed a highly efficient preparation method for extracellular vesicles that delivers up to 100 times more particles per cell and hour than conventional methods. They describe the new method in the journal Communications Biology.Credit: Swiss Nanoscience Institute, University of Basel\"We start the preparation process by cultivating cancer cells, in which we induce cell death by adding chemical stressors,\" explains Claudio Alter, first author of the study and a doctoral student at the SNI Ph.D. School. \"The cells then form vesicles, which detach from the parent cell after a few hours.\"With a diameter of 1 to 3 micrometers, these giant plasma membrane vesicles are far too big for therapeutic applications. In the newly developed process, they are therefore pressed through a filter membrane multiple times in order to reduce their size. \"After multiple filter passes, we obtain a homogeneous solution of nano plasma membrane vesicles (nPMV) with a diameter of 120 nanometers\u2014precisely what we need for subsequent applications,\" explains Alter.Different origin, different applicationsThe team of researchers then characterized these nPMVs and compared their size, homogeneity, and protein and lipid cargo with those of exosomes\u2014currently the most commonly used extracellular vesicles. They also investigated how well the nPMVs interact with other cells. In these analyses, the nano plasma membrane vesicles showed similar properties to exosomes.\"Their specific cargo and the presence of membrane-bound markers derived from the parent cell line offers the possibility to use nPMVs for therapeutic purposes,\" says J\u00f6rg Huwyler. \"At present, we're primarily thinking of a stimulation of the immune system\u2014for example, in vaccination or in immunotherapy treatments for cancer.\" More information:Claudio L.

  "text": "In a new paper published in eLight, a team of scientists led by Professors Haizheng Zhong and Yongyou Zhang from the Beijing Institute of Technology and Professor Haiyan Qin from Zhejiang University have discovered nonlocal effects in large semiconductor nanocrystals. They provide new strategies to achieve high-efficiency multiple excitons for quantum optics and energy conversation applications.          Auger recombination in bulk materials only slightly affects the biexciton recombination due to the lower carrier density and momentum conservation. Thick-shelled CdSe/CdS nanocrystals were developed to suppress Auger recombination to gain high biexciton efficiency. The research team achieved this by reducing the wave function overlap between the electrons and holes.Large colloidal QDs may be suitable candidates to generate efficient biexciton emission, but have rarely been investigated. The research team reported that the Auger recombination rate in large perovskite nanocrystals could be exponentially decreased due to the nonlocal effects.Nonlocal effects refer to the influence of wave spatial dispersion on the light-matter interactions. Nonlocal effects have been successfully demonstrated in plasmonics to explain optical response in metallic nanostructures. Auger recombination can be described as an energy shift from an exciton to another electron or hole or a process in which one electron or hole absorbs an exciton to a higher energy level. Accordingly, the nonlocal effects of Auger recombination are mainly determined by the wavefunction of the exciton.At room temperature, the estimated wavelength of an exciton in CsPbBr3 is ~14 nm, enabling the possibility to observe the nonlocal interaction enhanced biexciton emission in large nanocrystals with a size of > 14 nm. Benefiting from the unique defects tolerance ability of perovskite nanocrystals, the research team observed high biexciton efficiency in large CsPbBr3 nanocrystals.There is a linear relation between the biexciton Auger recombination lifetime and volume for small nanocrystals. The maximum biexciton lifetime is ~100 ps due to the strong Auger recombination. For bulk materials, Auger recombination is mainly related to the carrier density and band structure with a constant coefficient. For example, a bulk crystal with a carrier density of 1018 is predicted to have a biexciton lifetime of ~10 ns.In the mesoscale region, the nonlocal effects are expected to alternate the biexciton lifetime with volume from linear scaling to exponential, which is observed in large CsPbBr3 nanocrystals for the first time.In conclusion, the research team discovered nonlocal effects of biexciton emission in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals by comparing their spectroscopic results of large nanocrystals with previously reported small nanocrystals. Such a nonlocal effect can be illustrated by considering the nonlocal interactions between carriers and excitons on Auger recombination.With volume increasing, the Auger recombination rate of large CsPbBr3 nanocrystals can be exponentially reduced to achieve high biexciton efficiency of up to 80%. The discovered nonlocal effects in large nanocrystals provide a guideline to fabricate advanced quantum emitters with efficient biexciton (multiple excitons) emission and create new opportunities to explore semiconductor nanocrystals beyond strong quantum confinement.

Thirdly, the strong interfacial interactions between MXene and MOFs offer superior structural integrity and stability.Finally, the tunable crystal structure and diverse morphologies of MOFs can help the hybrids accommodate various specific applications. Therefore, it is promising to employ MXene/MOF composites as functional materials for high-performance electrochemical devices.\"In this review, we systematically discussed and summarized the synthesis strategies of MXene/MOF composites as well as the derivation process of MXene/MOF-derived materials. Then, the important electrochemical applications of MXene/MOF composites and their derivatives, which covered supercapacitors, alkali metal-ion batteries, multivalent ion batteries, LSBs, water splitting, and ORR, were comprehensively analyzed and concluded,\" Pang said.\"The introduction of MXene can effectively compensate for the chemical instability and low electron conductivity of MOFs. In turn, the severe oxidation degradation and self-stacking of MXene can be well resolved by the implant of MOFs.\"\"Numerous works have demonstrated that MXene/MOF composites exhibit better electrochemical properties (such as specific capacities, rate performance, cycling stability, Tafel slope, etc.) than that of pure MXene and pristine MOFs because of the well-designed structure, strong interfacial interaction, sufficient active sites, and exoteric conductive channels. Moreover, various functional MOF-derived nanomaterials have been successfully coupled with MXene and delivered greatly enhanced electrochemical performance.\"\"Despite many significant achievements in MXene/MOF composites and their derivatives have been published, their application in the electrochemistry field was still in its infancy,\" Pang said. \"For better development in the future, the major challenges and perspectives of MXene/MOF composites and their derivatives were discussed.\"\"The following aspects are noteworthy,\" Pang said. \"First, improve the diversity of MXene/MOF composites; second, optimize synthetic strategies; third, construct interfacial interactions; fourth, design complex architectures; fifth, explore MXene-derived MOF; sixth, fabricate energy-involved devices; finally, understand working mechanisms.\"\"Although MXene/MOF composites and their derivatives face many challenges yet to be addressed, the significant progress that they have made in electrochemical energy storage and conversion was witnessed by us all,\" Pang said. \"We believed that the review will contribute to a deeper understanding of functional MXene/MOF-based composites, and provide valid guidance for their future development in the field of electrochemical applications.\" More information:Hui Yang et al, Metal\u2013Organic Frameworks Meet MXene: New Opportunities for Electrochemical Application, Energy Material Advances (2023).

Then we suddenly increase the tensile force so that the glass breaks in the middle and a very sharp tip forms,\" explains Khasanova, who is working on her Ph.D. in chemistry in the Electrochemical Nanotechnology Group.Khasanova and her colleagues need the minuscule nozzles to print incredibly tiny three-dimensional metallic structures. This means the nozzles' openings must be equally tiny\u2014in some cases so small that only a single molecule can squeeze through. \"We are trying to take 3D printing to its technological limits,\" says Dr. Dmitry Momotenko, who leads the junior research group at the Institute of Chemistry. \"We want to assemble objects atom by atom.\"'Metals are the perfect solution'Nanoscale 3D printing\u2014in other words 3D printing of objects that are a just few billionths of a meter in size\u2014opens up amazing opportunities, the chemist explains. For metal objects in particular, he can envisage numerous applications in areas such as microelectronics, nanorobotics, sensor and battery technology. \"Electroconductive materials are needed for all kinds of applications in these areas, so metals are the perfect solution.\"While 3D printing of plastics has already advanced into these nanoscale dimensions, manufacturing tiny metal objects using 3D technology has proven more difficult. With some techniques the printed structures are still a thousand times too large for many advanced applications, while with others it is impossible to fabricate the objects with the necessary degree of purity.Momotenko specializes in electro-plating, a branch of electrochemistry where metal ions suspended in a salt solution are brought into contact with a negatively charged electrode. The positively charged ions combine with electrons to form neutral metal atoms which are deposited on the electrode, forming a solid layer.\"A liquid salt solution becomes a solid metal\u2014a process which we electrochemists can control very effectively,\" says Momotenko. This same process is used for chrome-plating car parts and gold-plating jewelry on a larger scale.      A little smaller than usualHowever, transferring it to the nanoscopic scale requires considerable ingenuity, effort and care, as a visit to the group's small laboratory on the Wechloy campus confirms. The lab contains three printers\u2014all built and programmed by the team itself, as Momotenko points out. Like other 3D printers they consist of a print nozzle, tubes for feeding in the print material, a control mechanism and the mechanical components for moving the nozzle\u2014but in these printers everything is a little smaller than usual.A colored saline solution flows through delicate tubes into the thin capillary tube, which in turn contains a hair-thin piece of wire\u2014the anode. It closes the circuit with the negatively polarized cathode, a gold-plated silicon flake smaller than a fingernail, which is also the surface on which the printing takes place. Micromotors and special crystals that morph instantaneously when an electrical voltage is applied rapidly move the nozzle by fractions of a millimeter in all three spatial directions.Unwanted vibrationsSince even the slightest vibrations can disrupt the printing process, two of the printers are housed in boxes covered in a thick layer of dark-colored acoustic foam. Furthermore, they are resting on granite plates, each weighing 150 kilograms. Both measures are aimed at preventing unwanted vibrations. The lamps in the lab are also battery-powered because the electromagnetic fields produced by alternating current from a socket would interfere with the tiny electrical currents and voltages needed to control the nanoprinting process.Meanwhile, Liaisan Khasanova has prepared everything for a test print: the print nozzle is in its starting position, the box is closed, a vial containing a light blue copper solution is connected to the tubes. She starts a program that initiates the printing process. Measurement data appears on a screen as curves and dots. These show the variations in the current flow and register the nozzle briefly touching the substrate and then retracting again and again. What is the machine printing? \"Just a few columns,\" she replies.Venturing deep into the nanoworldColumns are the simplest geometric forms generated in 3D printing, but the Oldenburg researchers can also print spirals, rings and all kinds of overhanging structures. The technique can currently be used to print with copper, silver and nickel, as well as nickel-manganese and nickel-cobalt alloys.In some of their experiments, they have already ventured deep into the nanoworld. Momotenko and an international team of researchers reported in a study published in the journal Nano Letters in 2021 that they had produced copper columns with a diameter of just 25 nanometers\u2014taking 3D metal printing below the 100-nanometre limit for the first time.One of the cornerstones for this success was a feedback mechanism that enables precision control of the print nozzle's movements. It was developed by Momotenko together with Julian Hengsteler, a Ph.D. student he super-vised at his previous place of work, ETH Zurich in Switzerland. \"The continuous retraction of the print nozzle is enormously important, because otherwise it would quickly become clogged,\" explains the chemist.How to control the invisibleThe team prints the tiny objects layer by layer at speeds of a few nanometers per second. Momotenko still finds it amazing that objects too small to be visible to the human eye are being created here. \"You start with an object you can touch. Then a certain transformation takes place and you are able to control these invisible things at an extremely small scale\u2014it is almost unbelievable,\" says the chemist.Momotenko's plans for his nanoprinting technique are also pretty mind-boggling. His goal is to lay the foundations for batteries that can be charged a thousand times faster than current models. \"If that can be achieved, you could charge an e-car within seconds,\" he explains. The basic idea he is pursuing is already around 20 years old.The principle is to drastically shorten the pathways of the ions inside the battery during the charging process. To do this, the electrodes, which are currently flat, would have to have a three-dimensional surface structure. \"With the current battery design, charging takes so long because the electrodes are relatively thick and far apart,\" Momotenko explains.The solution, he says, is to interlock the anodes and cathodes like fingers at the nanoscale and reduce the distance between them to just a few nanometers. This would allow the ions to move between anode and cathode at lightning speed. The problem: so far it has not been possible to produce battery structures with the required nano dimensions.Fabricating battery materials with ultrasmall structural featuresMomotenko has now taken on this challenge. In his NANO-3D-LION project, the goal is to develop and employ advanced nanoscale 3D printing techniques to fabricate active battery materials with ultrasmall structural features.Having collaborated successfully with a research group led by Prof. Dr. Gunther Wittstock at the Institute of Chemistry in an earlier project, Momotenko then decided to base the project at the University of Oldenburg. \"The Department for Research and Transfer was very helpful with my grant application, so I moved here from Zurich at the beginning of 2021,\" he explains.His research group now has four members: besides Khasanova, Ph.D. student Karuna Kanes and Master's student Simon Sprengel have joined the team. Kanes focuses on a new method aimed at optimizing the precision of the print nozzle, while Sprengel investigates the possibility of printing combinations of two different metals\u2014a process necessary to produce cathode and anode material simultaneously in one step.Liaisan Khasanova will soon focus on lithium compounds. Her mission will be to find out how the electrode materials currently used in lithium batteries can be structured using 3D printing. The team is planning to investigate compounds such as lithium-iron or lithium-tin, and then to test how large the nano \"fingers\" on the electrode surfaces need to be, what spacing is feasible, and how the electrodes should be aligned.Research in the 'glove box'One major hurdle here is that lithium compounds are highly reactive and can only be handled under controlled conditions. For this reason, the team recently acquired an extra-large version of a laboratory glove box, a gas-tight sealed chamber that can be filled with an inert gas such as argon. It has handling gloves built into one side with which the researchers can manipulate the objects inside.The chamber, which is about three meters long and weighs half a ton, is not yet in operation, but the team plans to set up another printer inside it. \"The chemical conversion of the material and all other tests will also have to be carried out inside the chamber,\" Momotenko explains.The team will run up against some major questions in the course of the project. How do tiny impurities with-in the argon atmosphere affect the printed lithium nanostructures? How to dissipate the heat that is inevitably generated when batteries are charged within seconds? How to print not just tiny battery cells but also large batteries for powering a mobile phone or even a car\u2014within a reasonable time?\"On the one hand, we are working on the chemistry needed to produce active electrode materials at the nanoscale; on the other, we are trying to adapt the printing technology to these materials,\" says Momotenko, outlining the current challenges.The problem of energy storage is complexThe problem of energy storage is extremely complex, and his team can only play a small part in solving it, the researcher emphasizes. Nonetheless, he sees his group in a good starting position: in his opinion, electrochemical 3D printing of metals is currently the only viable option for manufacturing nanostructured electrodes and testing the concept.In addition to battery technology, the chemist is also working on other bold concepts. He wants to use his printing technique to produce metal structures that allow for a more targeted control of chemical reactions than possible so far. Such plans play a role in a relatively young field of research known as spintronics, which focuses on the manipulation of \"spin\"\u2014a quantum mechanical property of electrons.Sensors that detect individual moleculesAnother idea he hopes to put into practice is to manufacture sensors that are able to detect individual molecules. \"That would be helpful in medicine, for detecting tumor markers or biomarkers for Alzheimer's at extremely low concentrations, for example,\" says Momotenko.All these ideas are still very new approaches in chemistry. \"It is not yet clear how it would all work,\" he admits. But that's how it is in science. \"Every meaningful research project requires long thinking and planning, and in the end most ideas fail,\" he concludes. But sometimes they don't\u2014and he and his team have already taken the first successful steps on their journey.

This research paves the way for scientists to develop better materials for various next-generation applications including quantum computing, microelectronics, sensors, and energy catalysis.          The researchers' paper is published in Nature Nanotechnology.\"This is truly remarkable discovery, as it unveils an unparalleled and simple way for navigating material synthesis at the atomic scale by harnessing the power of epitaxial strain,\" said Bharat Jalan, senior author on the paper and a professor and Shell Chair in the University of Minnesota Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science.\"This breakthrough represents a significant advancement with far-reaching implications in a broad range of fields. Not only does it provide a means to achieve atomically-precise synthesis of quantum materials, but it also holds immense potential for controlling oxidation-reduction pathways in various applications, including catalysis and chemical reactions occurring in batteries or fuel cells.\"\"Stubborn\" metals oxides, such as those based on ruthenium or iridium, play a crucial role in numerous applications in quantum information sciences and electronics. However, converting them into thin films has been a challenge for researchers due to the inherent difficulties in oxidizing metals using high-vacuum processes.The fabrication of these materials has perplexed materials scientists for decades. While some researchers have successfully achieved oxidation, the methods used thus far have been costly, unsafe, or have resulted in poor material quality.The University of Minnesota researchers' solution? Give it a stretch.While attempting to synthesize metal oxides using conventional molecular beam epitaxy, a low-energy technique that generates single layers of material in an ultra-high vacuum chamber, the researchers stumbled upon a groundbreaking revelation. They found that incorporating a concept called \"epitaxial strain\"\u2014effectively stretching the metals at the atomic level\u2014significantly simplifies the oxidation process of these stubborn metals.\"This enables the creation of technologically important metal oxides out of stubborn metals in ultra-high vacuum atmospheres, which has been a longstanding problem,\" said Sreejith Nair, first author of the paper and a University of Minnesota chemical engineering Ph.D. student. \"The current synthesis approaches have limits, and we need to find new ways to push those limits further so that we can make better quality materials. Our new method of stretching the material at the atomic scale is one way to improve the performance of the current technology.\"Although the University of Minnesota team used iridium and ruthenium as examples in this paper, their method has the potential to generate atomically-precise oxides of any hard-to-oxidize metal. With this groundbreaking discovery, the researchers aim to empower scientists worldwide to synthesize these novel materials.The researchers worked closely with collaborators at Auburn University, the University of Delaware, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, and fellow University of Minnesota Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science Professor Andre Mkhoyan's lab to verify their method.\"When we looked at these metal oxide films very closely using very powerful electron microscopes, we captured the arrangements of the atoms and determined their types,\" Mkhoyan explained. \"Sure enough, they were nicely and periodically arranged as they should be in these crystalline films.\" More information:Sreejith Nair, Engineering metal oxidation using epitaxial strain, Nature Nanotechnology (2023).

  "text": "Two-dimensional (2D) perovskite thin films possess diverse tunability, excellent optoelectronic properties and superior long-term stability, which are of great significance for high performance of perovskite solar cells. This study was led by Professor Guifu Zou from College of Energy, Soochow Institute for Energy and Materials Innovations, Soochow University.          \"The biggest obstacle to achieving high-performance 2D perovskite solar cells is the inferior out-of-plane charge transport caused by the alternating arrangement of inorganic frameworks and organic space layers, also known as multiple quantum well electronic structures,\" says Professor Zou.\"Over the past decade, molecular ferroelectrics with perovskite structure have been extensively studied due to excellent characteristics such as strong saturation polarization, high Curie temperature, multiaxial properties, low preparation temperature, and narrow band gap. The polarization field in molecular ferroelectricity will be greatly helpful to improve the performance of 2D perovskite solar cells.\"As documented in a new paper published today in National Science Review, researchers fabricated 2D perovskite solar cells based on molecular ferroelectric with large spontaneous polarization, high Curie temperature and multi-equivalent ferroelectric axes.\"The moderate band gap and high absorbance coefficient of these materials enable effective absorption of visible light. Moreover, their low crystallization temperature makes it possible to design devices with optimal energy level structures,\" says Chen Wang, first author of the study and a Ph.D. student in Professor Zou's team.\"The high Curie temperature, large spontaneous polarization and strong residual polarization ensure excellent ferroelectric properties at room temperature.\"Studies on the photoelectric properties of molecular ferroelectrics have revealed that the depolarization field can affect the photoluminescence and interfacial energy level of the film.The chemical environment of the constituent elements changes after polarization, indicating that the lead iodide inorganic framework might participate in the polarization process. \"We hope our findings will contribute to a better understanding of the polarization process in molecular ferroelectrics,\" says Wang.\"What we found is that polarization fields can effectively separate and transport charges that are trapped in multiple quantum well electronic structures, resulting in improved device performance after polarization,\" says another Ph.D. student Lutao Li from Professor Zou's team, the co-author on the new paper.      \"Under one sun illumination, the obtained 2D ferroelectric solar cells achieved an impressive performance, which is the highest open circuit voltage (1.29 V) and the best efficiency among the 2D (n=1) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite solar cells.\"Simulations of ferroelectric photovoltaic devices can aid in the understanding of the space charge region and electric potential within the p-i-n junction under the influence of polarization.This study not only provides a solution platform for the poor out-of-plane conductivity from intrinsic multiple quantum well electronic structure limits of 2D materials, but also demonstrates a promising application for 2D molecular materials for optoelectronics.\"Thin film materials are extensively researched in the field of optoelectronics and photovoltaics, and creating desirable thin films or surpassing the limitations of 2D thin-film materials is a significant challenge.

This breakthrough has led to the demonstration of highly efficient 2D thin film solar cells,\" says Dr. Nilan J.B. Kamathewatta, a thin-film scientist at Intel Corporation.\"In recent years, emerging molecular ferroelectrics with unique and excellent properties have shown promising prospects in the field of ferroelectricity. These exciting developments have made ferroelectric research a hot topic once again. Professor Zou's work provides evidence for a deeper understanding of the origin of ferroelectricity in molecular ferroelectrics. I believe that this study will draw more attention from scientists to molecular ferroelectrics and further expand their applications in various fields,\" says Professor Rengen Xiong, Director of the Order Matter Science Research Center at Nanchang University.\"Perovskite solar cells have attracted unprecedented attention in recent years for their high power conversion efficiency, ease of fabrication, and tunable properties. In Professor Zou's study, novel molecular ferroelectrics are utilized to fabricate 2D perovskite solar cells. The introduction of ferroelectricity improved the separation and transport of out-of-plane carriers, resulting in excellent device performance. Additionally, the incorporation of ferroelectricity within the molecular ferroelectrics enhances the built-in electric field, providing innovative solutions to achieve high open-circuit voltage perovskite solar cells,\" according to Professor JaeJoon Lee, President of the Korean Photovoltaic Society.The researchers are focusing on improving the efficiency of molecular ferroelectrics by exploring materials that possess lower bandgap, higher residual polarization, and other favorable properties.\"In the pursuit of achieving better performance in molecular ferroelectric solar cells, low-bandgap molecular ferroelectrics with 3D structures will be given more attention in the future. There is still much to be discovered in this field,\" says Professor Zou.The Guifu Zou Research Group at Soochow University is a leading research team dedicated to exploring new frontiers in the field of thin-film materials science. In addition to their work on molecular ferroelectric materials, the group has conducted groundbreaking research in the area of ultrathin film materials.The team's research in thin film materials has focused on developing innovative methods for depositing and growing high-quality thin films with precise control over their properties. They have investigated a range of techniques to optimize the growth process and improve the properties of the resulting thin films.One of the major accomplishments in the field of thin film materials is the development of new methods for growing complex thin films. These thin films are characterized by their high crystalline quality and excellent electrical conductivity, making them ideal for use in electronic devices and energy conversion applications.In addition to their research on thin films, the group has also explored other types of ultrathin films, such as 2D films and other atomically-thin films. Their research has led to many important discoveries and advancements in these areas, including insights into the growth mechanisms of ultrathin films and new physics for specific applications.Overall, the Guifu Zou Research Group's research in thin film materials represents an important contribution to the field of materials science.

  "text": "A team of engineers at the University of California San Diego has developed the first fully integrated wearable ultrasound system for deep-tissue monitoring, including for subjects on the go. It facilitates potentially life-saving cardiovascular monitoring and marks a major breakthrough for one of the world's leading wearable ultrasound labs. The paper, \"A fully integrated wearable ultrasound system to monitor deep tissues in moving subjects,\" is published in the May 22, 2023 issue of Nature Biotechnology.          \"This project gives a complete solution to wearable ultrasound technology\u2014not only the wearable sensor, but also the control electronics are made in wearable form factors,\" said Muyang Lin, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Nanoengineering at UC San Diego and the first author on the study. \"We made a truly wearable device that can sense deep tissue vital signs wirelessly.\"The research emerges from the lab of Sheng Xu, a professor of nanoengineering at UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering and corresponding author of the study.This fully integrated autonomous wearable ultrasonic system-on-patch (USoP) builds on the lab's previous work in soft ultrasonic sensor design. However, previous soft ultrasonic sensors all require tethering cables for data and power transmission, which largely constrains the user's mobility. In this work, it includes a small, flexible control circuit that communicates with an ultrasound transducer array to collect and transmit data wirelessly. A machine learning component helps interpret the data and track subjects in motion.                A wearable ultrasonic-system-on-patch for deep tissue monitoring.

Abnormal values of blood pressure and cardiac output, at rest or during exercise, are hallmarks of heart failure. For healthy populations, our device can measure cardiovascular responses to exercise in real time and thus provide insights into the actual workout intensity exerted by each person, which can guide the formulation of personalized training plans.\"The USoP also represents a breakthrough in the development of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), a term for a network of medical devices connected to the internet, wirelessly transmitting physiological signals into the cloud for computing, analysis and professional diagnosis.      Thanks to technological advances and the hard work of clinicians over the last few decades, ultrasound has received an ongoing wave of interest, and the Xu lab is often mentioned in the first breath as an early and enduring leader in the field, particularly in wearable ultrasound. The lab took devices that were stationary and portable and made them stretchable and wearable, driving a transformation across the landscape of healthcare monitoring. Its strength rests in part on its close collaboration with clinicians. \"Although we are engineers, we do know the medical problems that clinicians face,\" Lin said. \"We have a close relationship with our clinical collaborators and always get valuable feedback from them. This new wearable ultrasound technology is a unique solution to address many vital sign monitoring challenges in clinical practice.\"                A wearable ultrasonic-system-on-patch for deep tissue monitoring. Credit: Muyang Lin             While developing its latest innovation, the team was surprised to discover that it had more capabilities than initially anticipated.\"At the very beginning of this project, we aimed to build a wireless blood pressure sensor,\" said Lin. \"Later on, as we were making the circuit, designing the algorithm and collecting clinical insights, we figured that this system could measure many more critical physiological parameters than blood pressure, such as cardiac output, arterial stiffness, expiratory volume and more, all of which are essential parameters for daily health care or in-hospital monitoring.\"Moreover, when the subject is in motion, there will be relative movement between the wearable ultrasonic sensor and the tissue target, which will require frequent manual readjustment of the wearable ultrasonic sensor to keep track of the moving target. In this work, the team developed a machine learning algorithm to automatically analyze the received signals and choose the most appropriate channel to keep track of the moving target.However, when the algorithm is trained using one subject's data, that learning may not be transferable to other subjects, making the results inconsistent and unreliable.

We can train the algorithm on one subject and apply it to many other new subjects with minimal retraining.\"Moving forward, the sensor will be tested among larger populations. \"So far, we have only validated the device performance on a small but diverse population,\" said Xiaoxiang Gao, a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of NanoEngineering at UC San Diego and co-first author on the study. \"As we envision this device as the next generation of deep-tissue monitoring devices, clinical trials are our next step.\"Xu is the co-founder of Softsonics, LLC, which plans to commercialize the technology.

  "text": "National University of Singapore (NUS) pharmaceutical scientists have developed multi-functional synthetic peptide nanonets for relieving inflammation caused by bacterial infection. This is achieved by concurrent trapping of bacterial endotoxins and pro-inflammatory cytokines.          Endotoxemia is characterized by the presence of endotoxins in the blood. These endotoxins can be released by gram-negative pathogens such as E. coli during systemic infections. When left unchecked, inflammatory host responses can result in extensive tissue damage and septic shock, which are associated with a high mortality rate. Unfortunately, past research efforts to develop targeted therapies against sepsis have largely been unsuccessful due to the complex nature of interactions between pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators.A more recent approach focuses on multi-cytokine for better management of septic complications. A research team led by Associate Professor Rachel Ee from the Department of Pharmacy, NUS demonstrated that antibacterial peptide nanonets could possess additional functionalities to mitigate inflammatory responses that are commonly associated with bacterial infections.These findings are built on the team's previous report of the design of anti-microbial peptides capable of in situ self-assembly into bacteria-trapping nanonets. Anti-inflammatory activity was achieved through the ability of the nanonets to bind and entrap endotoxins released by gram-negative pathogens, and inflammation mediators produced by host macrophages. Of interest, the cationic nanonets selectively entrapped pro-inflammatory cytokines while minimally binding the anti-inflammatory cytokines. The team achieved this desirable specificity by capitalizing on the overall difference in net charge between these two different groups of cytokines.The new study is published in the journal Advanced Healthcare Materials.Additionally, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding effect resulted in the restoration of antimicrobial activity of colistin, a last-line therapy, against gram-negative pathogens. Notably, this is the first reported instance of multi-functional peptide nanonets with long-ranging effects in alleviating the damages of septic complications at multiple stages. Biological evaluations of the peptide nanonets using an acute lung injury model demonstrated their efficacy in lowering the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the bronchoalveolar fluid of endotoxin-inoculated murine models. The resulting peptide effect was comparable to the control drug dexamethasone.Prof. Ee said, \"Our peptide-based nanonets have shown unique therapeutic potential as a multi-functional biomaterial for holistic management of sepsis. Moving forward, we hope to continue their optimization for clinical use.\" More information:Nhan Dai Thien Tram et al, Multifunctional Antibacterial Nanonets Attenuate Inflammatory Responses through Selective Trapping of Endotoxins and Pro\u2010Inflammatory Cytokines, Advanced Healthcare Materials (2023).

  "answer_squad": " The new fabrication technique",
  "text": "Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have fabricated a novel device that could dramatically boost the conversion of heat into electricity. If perfected, the technology could help recoup some of the heat energy that is wasted in the U.S. at a rate of about $100 billion each year.          The new fabrication technique\u2014developed by NIST researcher Kris Bertness and her collaborators\u2014involves depositing hundreds of thousands of microscopic columns of gallium nitride atop a silicon wafer. Layers of silicon are then removed from the underside of the wafer until only a thin sheet of the material remains.The interaction between the pillars and the silicon sheet slows the transport of heat in the silicon, enabling more of the heat to convert to electric current. Bertness and her collaborators at the University of Colorado Boulder reported the findings online March 23 in Advanced Materials.Once the fabrication method is perfected, the silicon sheets could be wrapped around steam or exhaust pipes to convert heat emissions into electricity that could power nearby devices or be delivered to a power grid. Another potential application would be cooling computer chips.The NIST-University of Colorado study is based on a curious phenomenon first discovered by German physicist Thomas Seebeck. In the early 1820s, Seebeck was studying two metal wires, each made of a different material, that were joined at both ends to form a loop.He observed that when the two junctions connecting the wires were kept at different temperatures, a nearby compass needle deflected. Other scientists soon realized that the deflection occurred because the temperature difference induced a voltage between the two regions, causing current to flow from the hotter region to the colder one. The current created a magnetic field that deflected the compass needle.Credit: National Institute of Standards and TechnologyIn theory, the so-called Seebeck effect could be an ideal way to recycle heat energy that would otherwise be lost. But there's been a major obstacle. A material must conduct heat poorly in order to maintain a temperature difference between two regions yet conduct electricity extremely well to convert the heat to a substantial amount of electrical energy. For most substances, however, heat conductivity and electrical conductivity go hand in hand; a poor heat conductor makes for a poor electrical conductor and vice versa.      In studying the physics of thermoelectric conversion, theorist Mahmoud Hussein of the University of Colorado discovered that these properties could be decoupled in a thin membrane covered with nanopillars\u2014standing columns of material no more than a few millionths of a meter in length, or about one-tenth the thickness of a human hair. His finding led to the collaboration with Bertness.Using the nanopillars, Bertness, Hussein and their colleagues succeeded in uncoupling the heat conductivity from electrical conductivity in the silicon sheet\u2014a first for any material and a milestone for enabling efficient conversion of heat to electrical energy. The researchers reduced the heat conductivity of the silicon sheet by 21% without lowering its electrical conductivity or changing the Seebeck effect.In silicon and other solids, atoms are constrained by bonds and cannot move freely to transmit heat. As a consequence, the transport of heat energy takes the form of phonons\u2014moving collective vibrations of the atoms. Both the gallium nitride nanopillars and the silicon sheet carry phonons, but those within the nanopillars are standing waves, pinned down by the walls of the tiny columns much the way a vibrating guitar string is held fixed at both ends.The interaction between the phonons traveling in the silicon sheet and the vibrations in the nanopillars slow the traveling phonons, making it harder for heat to pass through the material. This reduces the thermal conductivity, thus increasing the temperature difference from one end to the other. Just as importantly, the phonon interaction accomplishes this feat while leaving the electrical conductivity of the silicon sheet unchanged.The team is now working on structures fabricated entirely of silicon and with a better geometry for thermoelectric heat recovery. The researchers expect to demonstrate a heat-to-electricity conversion rate high enough to make their technique economically viable for industry. More information:Bryan T.

  "text": "Recently, a research team led by Prof. Chen Chunying from the National Center for Nanoscience and Technology (NCNST) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) revealed that gut microbiota can ferment exogenous carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) as carbon sources into short chain fatty acids. The study was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and was reported as a Nature Highlight.          Gut microbiota are the major targets for exogenous nanomaterials through the oral route. Gut microbiota-governed biological processes determine the final fate of CNMs in the hosts. However, CNMs and numerous components in the gut, such as food, carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids, as well as the basic building blocks of life \"cells,\" contain the same constituent element\u2014carbon. It is very challenging to achieve precise analysis of the metabolic processes of CNMs in the gut using traditional methods.To solve this issue, the research team revealed the \"past and present\" of carbon nanomaterials in gut microbiota through the application of stable isotope 13C labeling technology, isotope metabolic flow tracing technology, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and microbiota gene sequencing.In this work, the researchers first found that gut microbiota could break down two types of CNMs: single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and graphene oxides (GO). By screening the intestinal metabolites, they demonstrated that short chain fatty acids significantly increased in the gut of mice treated with carbon nanomaterials by oral gavage.Using stable isotope 13C labeled graphite oxide and metabolic flow tracing technology, they found that CNMs were like dietary fiber and could be used as an available carbon source by gut microbiota for degradation and fermentation, which entered the pyruvate metabolic pathway to generate butyrate. During this process, a variety of microbial enzymes, including hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase and butyrate kinase, were involved in the fermentation of CNMs into butyrate.Microbial gene sequencing revealed that butyrate-producing bacteria are the dominant species that exploited CNMs to generate butyrate. Importantly, the excessive butyrate can affect gut homeostasis.This study for the first time clarifies the entire metabolic process of CNMs from the source to the end, breaking the traditional belief that microbes can only use carbohydrates to synthesize organic butyric acid molecules. The research confirms that intestinal microorganisms can use artificially synthesized CNMs as carbon sources to generate endogenous organic metabolites, reveals the new biological fate of CNMs in the host, and provides important theoretical support for expanding the application scenarios of CNMs. More information:Xuejing Cui et al, A new capacity of gut microbiota: Fermentation of engineered inorganic carbon nanomaterials into endogenous organic metabolites, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

  "text": "Optical imaging and metrology techniques are key tools for research rooted in biology, medicine and nanotechnology. While these techniques have recently become increasingly advanced, the resolutions they achieve are still significantly lower than those attained by methods using focused beams of electrons, such as atomic-scale transmission electron spectroscopy and cryo-electron tomography.          Researchers at University of Southampton and Nanyang Technological University have recently introduced a non-invasive approach for optical measurements with atomic-scale resolution. Their proposed approach, outlined in Nature Materials, could open exciting new possibilities for research in a variety of fields, allowing scientists to characterize systems or phenomena at the scale of a fraction of a billionth of a meter.\"Since the nineteen century, improvements of spatial resolution of microscopy has been a major trend in science that has been marked with at least seven Nobel Prizes,\" Nicolay I. Zheludev, one of the researchers who carried out the study told Phys.org. \"Our dream was to develop technology that can detect atomic scale events with light, and we have been working on this for the last three years.\"In their experiments, Zheludev and his colleagues demonstrated atomic scale metrology by collecting single-shot images of the diffraction pattern of topologically structured light with a wavelength of \u03bb\u2009=\u2009488\u2009nm scattered on a suspended nanowire that was 17-\u03bcm-long and 200-nm-wide, to determine its position relative to the fixed edges of the sample.The researchers then trained a deep learning algorithm on a dataset of single-shot images of scattering patterns that occurred when the nanowire was placed in 301 different positions. After training, this algorithm could predict the positions of a given nanowire based on the scattered light pattern recorded by the team's sensor.\"The main idea behind our approach is to use complex light structured at a very fine scale, the superoscillatory light containing singularities,\" Zheludev explained. \"If a sub-wavelength object moves in such a field, the scattering pattern of light on the object is very sensitive to the shape and position of the object. We employ a form of artificial intelligence, a deep learning analysis of the scattered light intensity profile to reconstruct the object's position.\"In the team's proof-of-principle experiments, their optical localization metrology method performed remarkably well, resolving the position of the suspended nanowire with a subatomic precision of 92\u2009pm (i.e., around \u03bb/5,300), while the nanowire naturally thermally oscillated with amplitude of \u223c150\u2009pm. For reference, a silicon atom is 220pm in diameter.\"Our most important achievement was to reach atomic scale resolution in detecting the position of nano-objects with light,\" Zheludev said. \"We have achieved resolution that is thousands of times better than conventional microscopes can offer. Our work opens the field of picophotonics, the science of light-matter interactions on the picometer scale.\"In their recent study, Zheludev and his colleagues demonstrated the potential of using optical metrology with topologically structured light to collect measurements on an atomic scale. In the future, the approach introduced in their paper could be used by other research teams worldwide to study subtle phenomena in greater detail and in non-invasive ways using light.\"We are now working on detecting picometer movements with a high frame rate, so we can shoot a video featuring the real dynamics of Brownian motion of a nanoscale object,\" Zheludev added.

  "text": "A research group led by Professor Minoru Osada (he, him) and postdoctoral researcher Yue Shi (she, her) at the Institute for Future Materials and Systems (IMaSS), Nagoya University in Japan, has developed a new technology to fabricate nanosheets, thin films of two-dimensional materials a couple of nanometers thick, in about one minute.          This technology enables the formation of high-quality, large nanosheet films with a single click without the need for specialized knowledge or technology. Their findings are expected to contribute to developing the industrial manufacturing process for various types of nanosheet devices. The study was published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.Nanosheets have a thickness that is measured in nanometers. Nanometers are so thin that the sheets cannot be seen from the side with the naked eye. They have potential uses in several different fields, including electronics, catalysis, energy storage, and biomedicine. Those made from graphene and inorganic nanosheets are being tested for use in a range of devices, from solar cells to sensors and batteries, because they have electrical, transparency, and heat-resistance functions different from those of conventional bulk materials.However, the current techniques used to fabricate these thin films, such as the Langmuir-Blodgett method require skilled operation and complex conditions. \"Using existing methods, it takes about one hour to fabricate a single layer,\" Osada said. \"This creates a major bottleneck in nanosheet manufacturing.\"The group aimed to develop a new process that can produce high-quality neatly tiled monolayer films of nanosheets easily and in a short time. They developed an automated film-forming process that produced nanosheets in about a minute with a simple drop of a colloidal aqueous solution onto a substrate heated on a hotplate using an automatic pipette. Afterwards, they followed this with aspiration of the solution and liquid removal. The result was a neatly tiled monolayer film with no gaps between the nanosheets.\"The reduction of the surface tension of the colloidal aqueous solution and the promotion of convection of the nanosheets suppressed the overlap and gaps between the nanosheets and allowed us control over its alignment,\" Osada said. \"Layer-by-layer construction of multilayer films controlled by the thickness unit of nanosheets was possible by repeating the neatly tiled monolayer film fabrication operation.\"\"The newly developed method is expected to become an important technology as an industrial thin-film fabrication method and nano-coating method for nanosheets because it is simple, quick, and requires only a small amount of solution to fabricate a high-quality, large-area film with a neatly tiled alignment,\" he said.\"The technology is based on simple drop and aspiration operations using an automatic pipette and does not require specialized knowledge or technology. This technology is applicable to nanosheets of various compositions and structures, such as oxides, graphene, and boron nitride, and can form films on substrates of various shapes, sizes, and materials, making it an extremely versatile film-forming technology,\" Osada said.

  "text": "The tiny visual systems of flying insects have inspired researchers of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) to develop optoelectronic graded neurons for perceiving dynamic motion, enriching the functions of vision sensors for agile response.          Biological visual systems can effectively perceive motion in a complicated environment with high energy efficiency. Particularly, flying insects have high flicker function frequency (FFF) and could perceive objects with high motion speeds. This nature inspiration could lead to advancing machine vision systems with very economical hardware resources. A conventional machine vision system for action recognition typically involves complex artificial neural networks such as \"spatial\" and \"temporal\" stream computation architectures.Led by Prof. Yang Chai, Associate Dean of Faculty of Science and Professor in Department of Applied Physics at PolyU, the research team showed that optoelectronic graded neurons can perform high information transmission rate (>1000 bit/s) and fuse spatial and temporal information at sensory terminals. Significantly, the research finding empowers the functionalities that are unavailable in conventional image sensors.Prof. Chai said, \"This research fundamentally deepens our understanding on bioinspired computing. The study finding contributes to potential applications on autonomous vehicles, which need to recognize high-speed motion on road traffic. Also, the technology may be used for some surveillance systems.\"Bioinspired in-sensor computingMachine vision systems usually consist of hardware with physically separated image sensors and processing units. However, most sensors can only output \"spatial\" frames without fusing \"temporal\" information. Acute motion recognition requires \"spatial\" and \"temporal\" stream information to be transferred to and fused in the processing units. This bioinspired in-sensor motion perception offers progress in motion processing, which has been a computational challenge that puts considerable demands on computational resources.The PolyU research \"Optoelectronic graded neurons for bioinspired in-sensor motion perception\" is published in Nature Nanotechnology. The research team has focused on studies on in-sensor computing to process visual information at sensory terminals. In other previous studies, the team demonstrated the contrast enhancement of static images and visual adaptation to different light intensities.Prof. Chai noted, \"We have been working on artificial vision for years. Previously, we only used sensor arrays to perceive static images in different environments and enhance their features. We further look into the question whether we can use a sensor array to perceive dynamic motion. However, sensory terminals cannot afford complicated hardware. Therefore, we choose to investigate the tiny visual systems such as those of flying insects which can agilely perceive dynamic motion.\"Flying insects such as Drosophila with a tiny vision system can agilely recognize a moving object much faster than a human can. Specifically, its visual system consists of non-spiking graded neurons (retina-lamina) that have a much higher information transmission rate (R) than the spiking neurons in the human visual system. The tiny vision system of insect greatly decreases the signal transmission distance between the retina (sensor) and brain (computation unit).Essentially, the graded neurons enable efficient encoding of temporal information at sensory terminals, which reduces the transfer of abundant vision data of fusing spatiotemporal (spatial and temporal) information in a computation unit. This bioinspired agile motion perception leads to the research team to develop artificially optoelectronic graded neurons for in-sensor motion perception.      Highly accurate motion recognitionHigh accurate motion recognition is essential for machine applications such as for automated vehicles and surveillance systems. The research found that the charge dynamics of shallow trapping centers in MoS2 phototransistors emulate the characteristics of graded neurons, showing an information transmission rate of 1,200\u2009bit\u2009s\u22121 and effectively encoding temporal light information.By encoding the spatiotemporal information and feeding the compressive images into an artificial neural network, the accuracy of action recognition reaches 99.2%, much higher than the recognition achieved with conventional image sensors (~50%).The research unleashes challenge in motion processing which demands considerable computational resources. Now, the artificially graded neurons enable direct sensing and encoding of the temporal information. The bioinspired vision sensor array can encode spatiotemporal visual information and display the contour of the trajectory, enable the perception of motion with limited hardware resources.Getting inspiration from agile motion perception of the insect visual systems, the research brings significant progress in the transmission speed and processing of integrated static and dynamic motion for machine vision systems in an intelligent way.

  "text": "High-temperature shock (HTS) is an emerging synthesis method with kinetics-dominated non-equilibrium characteristics, which can achieve an ultrafast heating/cooling rate of ~105 K/s and a peak temperature larger than ~3000 K within a time scale of seconds or milliseconds, and is widely used in the preparation of high entropy content, thermodynamic metastable phase and defect-rich materials.          Among these significant advances, nanoscale high entropy alloys (HEA) are particularly prominent in heterogeneous catalytic reactions with remarkable activity, selectivity, and stability due to flexible composition space and high-entropy mixing structure. There are numerous reports on using the HTS technologies to fabricate HEA and other high entropy materials in recent years; however, the construction strategies and inherent physicochemical fundamentals of HTS still remain to be thoroughly summarized and explored.Recently, a research team led by Prof. Yanan Chen from Tianjin University and Dr. Ye-Chuang Han from Xiamen University, China, presented physicochemical principles of HTS from the \"energy-space-time\" perspective, introduced representative HTS technologies (e.g., Joule heating, laser heating, microwave heating), summarized the advantages of HTS compared to traditionally thermodynamic-dominated near-equilibrium heating methods (e.g., tube furnace and muffle furnace) on synthesizing catalysts.In addition, the concepts and features of HEA were introduced, and the latest progress in the synthesis of HEAs using the HTS techniques was reviewed. Finally, conclusions and perspectives were also provided for future investigations of HTS and HEA, which has great significance to guide both the theoretical and experimental development of HTS and its application in HEA controllable preparations. The results were published in Chinese Journal of Catalysis.From the \"energy-space-time\" perspective, combining the law of conservation of energy and the relationship between heat and temperature, the factors of the heating rate for HTS can be deduced as follows: the absorption coefficient (\u03be), the power of input energy (P), and the natural features (specific heat capacity (c), mass (m)) of materials.The absorption coefficient is especially interrelated with the features of reactants and substrates, reaction environment, and heating approaches. In addition, the input energy directly effects on the target during HTS, therefore, the reaction volume (V) is a crucial parameter, and the heating rate depends on power density(E/t/V), which is the coupling of energy (E), space (V) and time (t).The higher the power density (means the greater energy, smaller space, shorter time), the faster the heating rate. The cooling process is mainly determined by the natural features of the materials due to the lack of energy input.HEA exhibits excellent catalytic activity and stability due to their four unique effects: thermodynamic high entropy, structural lattice distortion, kinetic sluggish diffusion, and \"cocktail\" effects. However, traditional methods used to prepare HEA have mostly resulted in large-sized bulk materials with small specific surface areas, thereby greatly hindering catalytic applications.HTS can inhibit the coalescence and growth of HEA nanoparticles. The authors summarized the latest progress in the preparation of HEA and other high entropy materials using typical HTS technologies (Joule heating, laser heating, and microwave heating), as well as their applications in catalytic reactions.Finally, outlooks were provided from the extreme non-equilibrium conditions and equipment of HTS, the rational design, advanced characterization and high-throughput screening of HEA.

  "text": "In nature, the skin of cephalopods (animals with tentacles attached to the head) exhibits unparalleled camouflage ability. Their skin contains pigment groups that can sense changes in environmental light conditions, and they adjust their appearance through the action of pigment cells. Although intricate in nature, this color-changing ability is fundamentally based on a mechanical mechanism in which pigment particles are folded or unfolded under the control of radial muscles.          Inspired by this natural process, a research team led by Dr. Jinyao Tang from the Department of Chemistry at The University of Hong Kong (HKU), developed a novel wavelength-selective intelligent colloid system to achieve light-controlled multi-dimensional phase segregation in collaboration with scientists from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Xiamen University.The team forms dynamic photochromic nanoclusters by mixing cyan, magenta and yellow microbeads, achieving photochromism on a macro scale. This macroscopic photochromism relies on light-induced vertical phase stratification in the active microbeads mixture, resulting in the enrichment of colored microbeads corresponding to the incident spectrum.Unlike existing color-changing materials, this new photochromic colloidal swarm relies on rearranging existing pigments rather than generating new chromophores in situ and is, therefore, more reliable and programmable. The team's findings provide a simple method for applications such as electronic ink, displays, and active optical camouflage, representing a major breakthrough in the field of active matter. Their research result has recently been published in the journal Nature.Self-actuated active particles are micro/nanoparticles that mimic the directional swimming of microorganisms in liquid. Recently, they have attracted significant attention in nanoscience and non-equilibrium physics and are being developed for potential biomedical applications. One of the main research objectives of active particles are to develop medical micro/nanorobots based on these particles for drug delivery and non-invasive surgery.However, the structure of active particles is very simple, and their driving mechanism and environment perception are significantly limited. In particular, the size and relatively simple structure of the individual micro/nano active particles restrict the complexity of implementing functions on their body. The challenge and key to realizing the future application is how to make active particles with intelligent characteristics despite their simple structure.      Light-powered microswimmers, a type of self-actuated active particles, have been recently developed for the purpose of creating a controllable nanorobot, which offers the potential for biomedical applications and functional novel materials as the swimmer activity, alignment direction, and interparticle interaction can be readily modulated with incident light. On the other hand, light not only induces photosensitive motion in microswimmers but also changes the effective interaction between particles. For example, photocatalytic reactions can change the local chemical gradient field, which in turn affects the movement trajectory of neighboring particles through the diffusion swimming effect, resulting in long-range attraction or repulsion.In this work, Tang's team designed a simple wavelength-selective TiO2 active microbeads system based on their previous research on light-powered microswimmers. Upon photoexcitation, the redox reaction on TiO2 particles generates a chemical gradient, which tunes the effective particle\u2013particle interaction. That is, the particle\u2013particle interaction can be controlled by combining incident light of different wavelengths and intensities.TiO2 microbeads with different photosensitive activities can be formed by selecting dye sensitization codes with different spectral characteristics. By mixing several otherwise identical TiO2 microbeads species loaded with dyes of different absorption spectra and adjusting the incident light spectra, the on-demand particle segregation is realized.                Novel ink composed of colourful microbeads adapts to the appearance of received light by light-driven separation. Credit: The University of Hong Kong             The purpose of realizing particle phase segregation is to control the particle aggregation and dispersion in liquid at both micro and macro levels. Effectively, this resulted in a novel photo-responsive ink by mixing microbeads with different photo-sensitivity that maybe applied to electronic paper. The principle is similar to the pigment clusters in the skin of cephalopods that can sense the light condition of the environment and change the appearance of surrounding pigment cells through their corresponding actions.\"The research findings have contributed significantly to advancing our knowledge of swarm intelligence in artificial active materials and have paved the way for designing innovative active smart materials. With this breakthrough, we anticipate the development of programmable photochromic ink that could be utilized in various applications such as e-ink, display ink, and even active optical camouflage ink,\" Dr. Jinyao Tang said.

Color conversion is used for numerous applications, including nonlinear microscopy for biological structures and material examinations, LED light sources and lasers in optical communications, and in photonics and its resulting technologies such as quantum computing. Researchers from Paderborn University have now found a way to improve the physical process underlying the phenomenon. The results have been published in the journal Light: Science & Applications.          \"The process is based on the anharmonic potential of crystal atoms and often prompts a precise multiplication of the light frequency, known as generating 'higher harmonics'\u2014similar to the overtones heard when the string on a musical instrument vibrates,\" Paderborn physicist Professor Cedrik Meier explains.Although the effect occurs naturally in many crystals, it is often extremely weak. Given this, there have been various approaches to increasing the effect, for example by combining different materials and their structures on a micro and nano scale. Paderborn University has conducted intensive, successful research in this area in recent decades.One focal point of this research into photonics is metamaterials, and in particular metasurfaces. This involves structured elements being applied in the nanometer range to a thin substrate, which then interacts with incoming light and for example produces optical resonances. With a longer duration and greater focus, the light can generate higher harmonics more efficiently.An interdisciplinary collaboration sees the research groups run by Professor Cedrik Meier (Nanophotonics & Nanomaterials), Professor Thomas Zentgraf (Ultrafast Nanophotonics) and Professor Jens F\u00f6rstner (Theoretical Electrical Engineering) at Paderborn University working together as part of the \"Tailored Nonlinear Photonics\" Collaborative Research Center/Transregio 142 to develop an innovative approach to generating higher harmonics more efficiently.

  "text": "E171, a food additive, has been used until recently as a whitening and opacifying agent in many products such as pastries, sweets, sauces and ice cream. It is composed of micro- and nanoparticles of titanium dioxide, or TiO2.          The scientific community has been scrutinizing these titanium dioxide nanoparticles. Previous studies on animal models have shown that they can cause the appearance of pre-cancerous cells in the colon among other effects in the body. On the basis of the precautionary principle, the use of E171 in food has been banned in France from 2020. All of Europe followed suit in 2022.Once ingested, nanoparticles accumulate in the liver and spleen after absorption from the intestine, but also in the placenta, until they contaminate the fetus. Scientists then wondered if there were other routes of exposure of the body to these nanoparticles.To answer this question, researchers from INRAE, in collaboration with the LNE (Laboratoire National de m\u00e9trologie et d'Essais, Paris), studied its absorption by the buccal cavity. They first studied their passage through the mouth of pigs (histologically very similar to that of humans), then the effect of the nanoparticles on human buccal cells in culture.Under these conditions, in vivo and in vitro respectively, tests show that they are indeed rapidly absorbed. Once absorbed, they damage the DNA of the cells by subjecting them to oxidative stress, affecting the survival of growing cells, an effect that may affect the renewal of the oral epithelium.These results not only confirm that these nanoparticles pass through the oral mucosa to reach the bloodstream, thus well before their absorption in the intestine, but also that they can affect cell regeneration within these same mucosa.This work highlights the importance of taking into account direct exposure of the oral cavity to the food additive E171 when assessing risks to humans, both when used in food products and in cosmetics (particularly toothpaste) and pharmaceuticals.E171 is used as a white food coloring and opacifying agent. It is still used in pharmaceutical preparations and toothpastes, and outside Europe in food. In this study, scientists tracked TiO2 particles using electron microscopy coupled with titanium spectrometry. They also used the \"nanoparticle-scope\", an innovative technology to map their distribution in tissues at the nanometer scale.The work is published in the journal Nanotoxicology.

  "question_squad": " What is the mainstay of treatment for leukemia?",
  "answer_squad": " Chemotherapy",
  "text": "Australian nanomedicine researchers have come up with a new approach to solving a decades-old clinical problem: getting treatment drugs to act selectively on cancer cells in the body. Published this week in Science Translational Medicine, the research paves the way to safer and more effective treatment options for children with aggressive blood cancers, and potentially other types of cancer as well.          Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for leukemia, the most common blood cancer in children. However, while chemotherapy can be very effective for certain types of leukemia, it is not as effective for some other types, known as \"high-risk\" leukemias. Treatment for high-risk leukemias generally involves high doses of toxic drugs that flood the body, indiscriminately affecting cancer cells and healthy cells alike. This often leads to severe side effects, as well as lifelong health issues in survivors.\"Finding a way to make treatment drugs act more selectively on cancer cells is the key to improving treatment success while reducing toxicity in children treated for high-risk leukemia,\" said Professor Maria Kavallaris AM, Head of the Translational Cancer Nanomedicine theme at Children's Cancer Institute, who led the research. \"By specifically targeting leukemia cells, we can make treatment more effective, as well as much safer to use in children.\"In the newly published research, scientists at Children's Cancer Institute and collaborating organizations used a special formulation of the cancer drug, doxorubicin (Caelyx), in which the drug is encapsulated in tiny particles called liposomes. To this formulation, they added \"bi-specific antibodies\"\u2014antibodies capable of recognizing and attaching to the drug at one end and to cancer cells at the other end, effectively acting as a bridge between the two. Known as a \"targeted drug delivery system,\" this acts to deliver the drug to its target, in this case leukemia cells, where the drug can do its job and kill the cells.\"What is particularly useful about this new approach is its flexibility,\" explained lead author, Dr. Ernest Moles, Research Fellow at Children's Cancer Institute. \"We can use this system to target any leukemia, including the high-risk subtypes that are killing Australian children every year. Rather than having to design a completely new therapeutic each time, all we need do is change the antibody bridge, and we can target the same drug to any child's blood cancer.\"      \"What's more, this approach could allow us to counter drug resistance in an individual patient. If the cancer cells in a child try to evade chemotherapy by altering their cell surface, we can modify the targeted drug delivery system so it is able to recognize that altered cancer cell. There will be no easy escape.\"The new approach was shown to work well not only in leukemia cells grown in the laboratory, but also in living models of the disease. In these models, the targeted drug delivery system was found not only to reduce the amount of leukemia, but also to significantly prolong survival\u2014in some cases, up to four-fold.The researchers believe this same approach could be used to improve the selectivity of a whole range of new-generation therapeutic agents, not just chemotherapy drugs, opening the way to offering children alternative therapeutic options that are much safer than those currently on offer. They are also excited about the potential contribution it could make in the dawning era of precision medicine.\"In the future, it may be that each child diagnosed with leukemia can have their treatment targeted to their specific subtype, based on the analysis of a blood sample,\" said Professor Kavallaris.\"We believe the controlled targeting of nanotherapeutics represents a real milestone in the treatment of childhood cancers, and we're very optimistic about where this could lead to.\"Matt Weston and his son Jacob, who is currently being treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, know all too well the significance of this research. \"I've followed this research project closely, and I've been absolutely blown away by the work of Maria, Ernest and the team at Children's Cancer Institute,\" said Matt.\"Having experienced firsthand how toxic the chemo treatment is through my son's journey, I could tell you some horror stories of the side effects even with a standard risk diagnosis. For those with high-risk leukemia, not only is the treatment far more toxic, but their chances of survival are much lower as well.\"I think about those children and their families all the time, and to know that we are closer to improving the treatment, reducing the toxicity, and improving their chances of survival gives me great hope.\" More information:Ernest Moles et al, Delivery of PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin by bispecific antibodies improves treatment in models of high-risk childhood leukemia, Science Translational Medicine (2023).

  "answer_squad": " Alexander Khanikaev's group",
  "text": "In everyday life we experience light in one of its simplest forms\u2014optical rays or beams. However, light can exist in much more exotic forms. Thus, even beams can be shaped to take the form of spirals; so-called vortex beams, endowed with unusual properties. Such beams can make dust particles to spin, just like they indeed move along some intangible spirals.          Light modes with such added structure are called \"structured,\" and even more exotic forms of structured light can be attained in artificial optical materials\u2014metamaterials, where multiple light waves come together and combine to create the most complex forms of light.In their two recent works, published back-to-back in Science Advances, and Nature Nanotechnology, City College of New York researchers from Alexander Khanikaev's group have created structured light on a silicon chip, and used this added structure to attain new functionalities and control not available before.To this aim, two-dimensional optical metamaterials, referred to as metasurfaces, and hosting a special kind of structured light spinning around just like vortex beams were created. By experiments carried out in Khanikaev's laboratory at The City College, researchers demonstrated a new kind of trap to confine structured optical modes and to guide them on the chip.In their Science Advances work, researchers show that, by slowly changing the pattern of metasurface in two directions, one can create optical resonators which trap structured light and radiate it. Interestingly, this underlying structure gave rise to unusual patterns of the radiated light\u2014optical vortex beams.Applying similar slow change in the pattern in one direction, as reported in Nature Nanotechnology work, researchers have created waveguided for structured light. These channels allow guiding optical signals while preserving the internal structure of light. As such, this is similar to the flow of currents in wires, if we could have wires with two flavors of charges.Interestingly, such currents have been of enormous interest in electronics recently, and a completely new class of electronic devices, commonly referred to as spintronic or valleytronic, was envisioned. In such devices it is not the flow of charge by itself that would transfer signals, but spin or valley of electrons, which promises a plethora of advantages in comparison to conventional electronic devices.Khanikaev's work envisions a similar concept, but with light rather than electrons. However, in contrast to electronic systems, optics and photonics have one significant advantage\u2014optical modes do not suffer from decoherence to the same degree as electrons, which can be vital for quantum technologies.The demonstrations by Khanikaev's group can be useful for quantum applications for several reasons. Thus, the added structure of optical modes can be used to encode quantum information in the form of quantum bits. This information can then be transported on a chip or emitted into free space for communicating quantum information between remote systems.Moving in this direction, the Khanikaev group is currently working on implementing these ideas with quantum states of structured light and realizing quantum logic in their photonic nanostructures.

  "answer_squad": " mitochondrial uncouplers",
  "text": "Although diabetes is a common condition, no cure exists yet. Current therapies can manage blood sugar levels, but they do not address insulin resistance. But now, recent research reported in ACS Nano shows that targeting certain highly reactive molecules in the liver can reverse insulin resistance in human liver cells and diabetic mice, providing a pathway toward a more long-lasting treatment.          Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body is no longer sensitive to insulin, which regulates blood sugar. Currently, no cure exists, and available treatments focus on managing symptoms and blood sugar levels. Some research has suggested that insulin resistance could be caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are highly unstable, oxygen-based molecules primarily produced by the mitochondria.A class of drugs known as mitochondrial uncouplers could help inhibit ROS production at its source, rather than merely cleaning up what's already been made, as conventional, antioxidant-based treatments do. Ultrasmall platinum nanoparticles are another highly efficient ROS scavenger, though their small size causes them to be cleared from the liver too quickly.But, by combining these two strategies into an all-in-one system, a highly effective and long-lasting treatment platform could be created. So, Jingjing Yang, Shaochun Tang, Yujun Song and colleagues wanted to design such a system, using biodegradable \"nanoscavengers\" that could potentially restore insulin sensitivity and treat type 2 diabetes.To build the nanoscavengers, the team coated a template with platinum nanoparticles and a layer of silica. Then, the template was removed to form hollow shells, which were loaded with a mitochondrial uncoupler and coated with a lipid bilayer.When mixed with two ROS, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O2-), the system reduced them to water and molecular oxygen. In experiments using human liver cells with induced type 2 diabetes, the nanoscavengers continued to clean up ROS, as well as increase glucose uptake, suggesting that the cells' insulin sensitivity was restored.The researchers then injected nanoscavengers intravenously into a diabetic mouse model. The constructs migrated to the liver, reducing the amount of fat present, restoring normal cellular function and returning blood glucose levels to normal. Symptoms of diabetic nephropathy were reversed nearly completely. The mice showed no signs of body weight changes or damage to their tissues or organs. The researchers say that this work could provide an effective strategy for long-term treatment of diabetes and other metabolic diseases.

  "text": "A new method of controlling the shape of tiny particles about one tenth of the width of human hair could make the technology that powers our daily lives more stable and more efficient, scientists claim.          The process, which transforms the structure of microscopic semiconductor materials known as quantum dots, provides industry with opportunities to optimize optoelectronics, energy harvesting, photonics, and biomedical imaging technologies, according to the Cardiff University-led team.Their study, published in Nano Letters, used a process called nanofaceting\u2014the formation of small, flat surfaces on nanoparticles\u2014to manipulate the quantum dots into a variety of shapes called nanocrystals.From cubes and olive-like structures to complex truncated octahedra, the international team of researchers say these nanocrystals have unique optical and electronic properties, which can be used in different types of technology.Dr. Bo Hou, a Senior Lecturer at Cardiff University's School of Physics and Astronomy who led the study, said, \"Quantum dots have the potential to revolutionize a number of industries because of the theoretically limitless efficiencies they offer. Our study is a significant step forward in the adoption of quantum dots technology across a wide range of energy and lighting industry applications. With further development, we might imagine the truncated octahedra we manufactured being used for energy harvesting in solar cells, improving efficiencies beyond the capabilities of current technologies which sit at around 33%.

  "text": "Researchers at Kanazawa University report in Nano Letters how high-speed atomic force microscopy leads to insights into processes relevant to Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, the technique is shown to be an excellent tool for studying the effect of drugs against the disease.          According to the amyloid hypothesis, Alzheimer's disease\u2014the most common type of dementia\u2014is caused by flaws in the production, accumulation, and disposal of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) in the brain. A\u03b2 refers to a group of peptides (protein fragments) that over time form plaques in the brain of people with Alzheimer's disease. Drugs aiming to reduce the aggregation of A\u03b2 have been developed, but recent findings show that different types of A\u03b2 aggregates have different contributions to the development of Alzheimer's disease.In particular, intermediate aggregates such as protofibrils are more toxic than the actual final fibrils, the main component of A\u03b2 plaques. A precise understanding of the complex aggregation pathways is therefore necessary for the further development of efficient drugs against Alzheimer's disease. Kenjiro Ono from Kanazawa University and colleagues have now succeeded in visualizing the structural dynamics of protofibrils, as well as the effect of a recently developed drug based on anti-A\u03b2 antibodies.HS-AFM movie of A\u03b242 PF on bare mica. Credit: Nano Letters (2023). DOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.3c00187The scientists looked at the formation and the structure of A\u03b2 protofibrils by means of high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). The latter method has in recent years emerged as a powerful nanoimaging tool for studying biomolecules and their dynamics at high spatiotemporal resolution. HS-AFM observations showed that protofibrils have a nodal structure, with stable structural features\u2014specifically, the binding angle between nodes\u2014across several samples. Importantly, this nodal structure is distinct from proper, mature fibrils, which have a helical structure.Ono and colleagues then investigated the dissociation of protofibrils. They found that the length of protofibrils depends on their concentration, suggesting that aggregates can dissociate spontaneously.To obtain detailed insights into the functioning of anti-A\u03b2 antibody drugs, the researchers examined the binding between A\u03b2 protofibrils and a new drug known as lecanemab. They found that the binding ability (affinity) of lecanemab for protofibrils is almost independent of the size of the protofibrils\u2014in other words, the affinity does not substantially vary throughout the aggregation process. HS-AFM observations further revealed that lecanemab covers the surface of small, pre-protofibril aggregates. In doing so, the drug inhibits the further aggregation into protofibrils, which in turn prevents the formation of proper A\u03b2 fibrils and plaques.The results of Ono and colleagues provide direct evidence of a mechanism through which an antibody drug interferes with the A\u03b2 aggregation process. More generally, the work confirms the versatility of the HS-AFM method for studying biochemical pathways. \"Single-molecule HS-AFM is an effective tool for revealing the structural dynamics of transient, metastable amyloid aggregation intermediates and the effects of anti-aggregating drugs on them,\" state the researchers.      High-speed atomic force microscopyThe general principle of atomic force microscopy (AFM) is to make a very small tip scan the surface of a sample. During this horizontal (xy) scan, the tip, which is attached to a small cantilever, follows the sample's vertical (z) profile, inducing a force on the cantilever that can be measured. The magnitude of the force at the xy position can be related to the z value; the xyz data generated during a scan then result in a height map providing structural information about the investigated sample. In high-speed-AFM (HS-AFM), the working principle is slightly more involved: the cantilever is made to oscillate near its resonance frequency. When the tip is moved around a surface, the variations in the amplitude (or the frequency) of the cantilever's oscillation\u2014resulting from the tip's interaction with the sample's surface\u2014are recorded, as these provide a measure for the local \"z\" value.HS-AFM results in a video, where the time interval between frames depends on the speed with which a single image can be generated (by xy-scanning the sample). Researchers at Kanazawa University have in recent years developed HS-AFM further, so that it can be applied to study biochemical molecules and biomolecular processes in real-time. Kenjiro Ono and colleagues have now applied the method to study the structural dynamics of amyloid-beta protofibrils, known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, as well as the effect of an anti-amyloid-beta antibody drug against the disease.

  "text": "With the rapid development of urbanization and industrialization, environmental problems became increasingly serious. Dye wastewater is considered to be one of the biggest challenges due to its high toxicity. Organic dyes have mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic properties, and threaten the health and life of humans while hindering plant photosynthesis, which brings risks to the ecosystem. Traditional organic pollutant treatment methods include the physical method, biological method, and chemical method.          These methods have drawbacks including poor efficiency, high energy consumption, and incomplete treatment, so it is necessary to develop new sewage treatment methods. In 1972, Fujishima performed the pioneering work of photocatalytic decomposition of water to produce hydrogen using TiO2 as a photocatalyst. After that, photocatalytic technology was developed for sewage treatment due to its advantages of superior mineralization ability, fast reaction rate, and no secondary pollution.TiO2 is a common photocatalytic material because of its high catalytic activity, non-toxicity, excellent chemical stability, and low cost. In order to apply TiO2 photocatalytic technology, it is essential to design a photocatalytic reactor with a simple structure, convenient assembly and outstanding treatment performance.In recent years, photocatalytic technology has been coupled with various advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) to improve photocatalytic performance. TiO2-based photocatalytic technology coupling with classical AOPs such as Fenton oxidation, plasma oxidation, and ozone oxidation was reported to improve the treatment of organic pollutants.Nanobubbles (NBs) are extremely small gas bubbles with unique physical properties, which make them a superior aeration method for many applications. Nanobubbles have been widely used in wastewater treatment due to their long residence time, large specific surface area, and free radicals generation ability. The researchers designed a UV/NBs/P25-TiO2 photocatalytic reactor to degrade methyl orange in water. The results showed that the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 coupling with nanobubbles is enhanced by 11.6% compared with that without bubbles.However, the TiO2 photocatalyst needs to be re-separated and recovered after photocatalytic degradation, which was unfavorable to the design of the photocatalytic reactor. Therefore, the fixed photocatalyst was required for assembling the photocatalytic reactor.A photocatalytic reactor was assembled using a Ti mesh coated with TiO2 nanotube array to degrade organic pollutants. The reactor coupling with nanobubbles technology showed outstanding photocatalytic degradation ability, with a degradation efficiency of Rhodamine B (RhB) of 95.39% after irradiation treatment. The other organic pollutants including methylene blue, tetracycline, and oxytetracycline hydrochloride were all photodegradable using this photocatalytic reactor, with degradation efficiencies of 74.23%, 68.68%, and 64.10%, respectively. Therefore, this work provides a strategy to develop a coupling technology of photocatalysis and nanobubbles to treat wastewater.The study is published in the journal Advanced Sensor and Energy Materials.

  "text": "A new study has shown for the first time how electrical creation and control of magnetic vortices in an antiferromagnet can be achieved, a discovery that will increase the data storage capacity and speed of next generation devices.          Researchers from the University of Nottingham's School of Physics and Astronomy have used magnetic imaging techniques to map the structure of newly formed magnetic vortices and demonstrate their back-and-forth movement due to alternating electrical pulses. Their findings have been published in Nature Nanotechnology.\"This is an exciting moment for us, these magnetic vortices have been proposed as information carriers in next-generation memory devices, but evidence of their existence in antiferromagnets has so far been scarce. Now, we have not only generated them, but also moved them in a controllable way. It's another success for our material, CuMnAs, which has been at the center of several breakthroughs in antiferromagnetic spintronics over the last few years,\" says Oliver Amin.CuMnAs has a specific crystal structure, grown in almost complete vacuum, atomic layer by atomic layer. It has been shown to behave like a switch when pulsed with electrical currents, and the research group in Nottingham, led by Dr. Peter Wadley, alongside international collaborators, have \"zoomed in\" on the magnetic textures being controlled; first with the demonstration of moving domain walls, and now with the generation and control of magnetic vortices.Key to this research is a magnetic imaging technique called photoemission electron microscopy, which was carried out at the U.K.'s synchrotron facility, Diamond Light Source. The synchrotron produces a collimated beam of polarized X-rays, which is shone onto the sample to probe to magnetic state. This allows for spatially resolution of micromagnetic textures as small as 20 nanometers in size.Magnetic materials have been technologically important for centuries, from the compass to modern hard disks. However almost all of these materials have belonged to one type of magnetic order: ferromagnetism. This is the type of magnet we are all familiar with from fridge magnets to washing machine motors and computer hard disks. They produce an external magnetic field that we can \"feel\" because all of the tiny atomic magnetic moments that constitute them like to align in the same direction. It is this field that causes fridge magnets to stick and that we sometimes see mapped out with iron filings.Because they lack an external magnetic field, antiferromagnets are hard to detect and, until recently, hard to control. For this reason they have found almost no applications. Antiferromagnets produce no external magnetic field because all of the neighboring constituent tiny atomic moments point in exactly opposite directions from each other. In doing so they cancel each other out and no external magnetic field is produced: they won't stick to fridges or deflect a compass needle.But antiferromagnets are magnetically more robust and movement of their tiny atomic moments happens approximately 1,000 times faster than a ferromagnet. This could create computer memory which operates far faster than current memory technology.\"Antiferromagnets have the potential to out-compete other forms of memory which would lead to a redesign of computing architecture, huge speed increases and energy savings. The additional computing power could have large societal impact. These findings are really exciting as they bring us closer to realizing the potential of antiferromagnet materials to transform the digital landscape,\" says Dr. Peter Wadley. More information:O. J.

  "text": "No one will ever be able to see a purely mathematical construct such as a perfect sphere. But now, scientists using supercomputer simulations and atomic resolution microscopes have imaged the signatures of electron orbitals, which are defined by mathematical equations of quantum mechanics and predict where an atom's electron is most likely to be.          Scientists at UT Austin, Princeton University, and ExxonMobil have directly observed the signatures of electron orbitals in two different transition-metal atoms, iron (Fe) and cobalt (Co) present in metal-phthalocyanines. Those signatures are apparent in the forces measured by atomic force microscopes, which often reflect the underlying orbitals and can be so interpreted.Their study was published in March 2023 as an Editors' Highlight in the journal Nature Communications.\"Our collaborators at Princeton University found that despite Fe and Co being adjacent atoms on the periodic table, which implies similarity, the corresponding force spectra and their measured images show reproducible experimental differences,\" said study co-author James R. Chelikowsky, the W.A. \"Tex\" Moncrief, Jr. Chair of Computational Materials and professor in the Departments of Physics, Chemical Engineering, and Chemistry in the College of Natural Sciences at UT Austin. Chelikowsky also serves as the director of the Center for Computational Materials at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences.Without a theoretical analysis, the Princeton scientists could not determine the source of the differences they spotted using high-resolution non-contact atomic force microscopy (HR-AFM) and spectroscopy that measured molecular-scale forces on the order of piconewtons (pN), one-trillionth of a Newton.\"When we first observed the experimental images, our initial reaction was to marvel at how experiment could capture such subtle differences. These are very small forces,\" Chelikowsky added.\"By directly observing the signatures of electron orbitals using techniques such as atomic force microscopy, we can gain a better understanding of the behavior of individual atoms and molecules, and potentially even how to design and engineer new materials with specific properties. This is especially important in fields such as materials science, nanotechnology, and catalysis,\" Chelikowsky said.      The required electronic structure calculations are based on density functional theory (DFT), which starts from basic quantum mechanical equations and serves as a practical approach for predicting the behavior of materials.\"Our main contribution is that we validated through our real-space DFT calculations that the observed experimental differences primarily stem from the different electronic configurations in 3d electrons of Fe and Co near the Fermi level, the highest energy state an electron can occupy in the atom,\" said study co-first author Dingxin Fan, a former graduate student working with Chelikowsky. Fan is now a postdoctoral research associate at the Princeton Materials Institute.The DFT calculations included the copper substrate for the Fe and Co atoms, adding a few hundred atoms to the mix and calling for intense computation, for which they were awarded an allocation on the Stampede2 supercomputer at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC).\"In terms of our model, at a certain height, we moved the carbon monoxide tip of the AFM over the sample and computed the quantum forces at every single grid point in real space,\" Fan said. \"This entails hundreds of different computations. The built-in software packages on TACC's Stampede2 helped us to perform data analysis much more easily. For example, the Visual Molecular Dynamics software expedites an analysis of our computational results.\"\"Stampede2 has provided excellent computational power and storage capacity to support various research projects we have,\" Chelikowsky added.By demonstrating that the electron orbital signatures are indeed observable using AFM, the scientists assert that this new knowledge can extend the applicability of AFM into different areas.What's more, their study, used an inert molecular probe tip to approach another molecule and accurately measured the interactions between the two molecules. This allowed the science team to study specific surface chemical reactions.For example, suppose that a catalyst can accelerate a certain chemical reaction, but it is unknown which molecular site is responsible for the catalysis. In this case, an AFM tip prepared with the reactant molecule can be used to measure the interactions at different sites, ultimately determining the chemically active site or sites.Moreover, since the orbital level information can be obtained, scientists can gain a much deeper understanding of what will happen when a chemical reaction occurs. As a result, other scientists could design more efficient catalysts based on this information.Said Chelikowsky: \"Supercomputers, in many ways, allow us to control how atoms interact without having to go into the lab. Such work can guide the discovery of new materials without a laborious 'trial and error' procedure.\" More information:Pengcheng Chen et al, Observation of electron orbital signatures of single atoms within metal-phthalocyanines using atomic force microscopy, Nature Communications (2023).

  "text": "Things do not always go as one wants in reality. This is especially true in the world of light. However, a research team at POSTECH has successfully controlled \"trions,\" a breakthrough toward developing what could ultimately be revolutionary optical communication technology.          The team of researchers led by Professor Kyoung-Duck Park and Ph.D. candidate Hyeongwoo Lee in the Department of Physics at POSTECH has succeeded in producing high purity trions by using a nanoscale plasmonic waveguide and controlling the location at which the particles were created.Excitons are formed when light is focused on semiconductor material. The exciton, a binding of an electron and a hole, is electrically neutral. Addition of one more electron to an exciton makes a trion. Even though both particles are used to make next-generation optical communications devices and solar cells, trions afford more advantages over excitons. They are better for practical device applications as they are controllable with an electric field and have a weaker binding energy.The team used a \"nanoscale plasmonic waveguide\" with gap width of about 200 nm to create trions. The waveguide helps change light into \"plasmons,\" a phenomenon of collective electron oscillations. It also strongly confines plasmons in a space that is smaller than the wavelength of light to transport them to the desired location.When a two-dimensional semiconductor material is transferred onto the waveguide, the material is stretched up along the groove on the waveguide. Focusing light onto the 2D material will form excitons in the semiconductor, and they flow to the center of the waveguide just like water poured through a funnel. The high energy of plasmons helps transport the electrons in the metal part of the waveguide toward the semiconductor. The transported electrons then move toward the center of the waveguide to bond with excitons, ultimately creating trions.The team also successfully controlled the location where trions are created by spatially controlling plasmons with the combination of adaptive optics and nano optics. With this technology, the researchers were able to produce both plasmons and trions at the desired location on the plasmonic waveguide.This research is significant in that \"light\" was employed instead of \"electricity\". The passage that light moves along helped find a solution to development of optical devices. It is also meaningful that the research brought together different disciplines: \"excitonics\" that studies particles such as excitons and \"plasmonics\" that explores plasmons. When facing our limits, we tend to find a solution within our field. However, the team thought outside the box to find a solution based on convergence of different disciplines.The research findings are expected to greatly contribute to efficient control of trion-based optical devices and development of highly-efficient devices for optically converting energy. Hyeongwoo Lee, the first author of the paper, said, \"I think the research defined a new physical concept that can create and control trions in nanoscale spaces. Based on the research outcome, I am sketching out research on a wide area information and communication technology with semiconductor particles.\"The plasmonic waveguide was fabricated by a team led by Hyuck Choo, executive vice president of Samsung Electronics; the pre-analysis of the samples was conducted by a team led by Professor Hong Seok Lee and Professor Sangmin An of Jeonbuk National University; the materials used in the experiment were prepared by a team led by Professor Ki Kang Kim of Sungkyunkwan University; and measurements were conducted together with Yeonjeong Koo, Huitae Joo, and Mingu Kang of the Department of Physics at POSTECH.The research is published in the journal Nature Communications.

  "answer_squad": " Radiotherapy",
  "text": "Radiotherapy is currently the main form of treatment for head and neck malignancies such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Within the radiation field of a tumor, salivary glands frequently suffer substantial damage following irradiation, resulting in xerostomia and a series of oral syndromes, which seriously impact the quality of patients' lives.          In 1998, the research team led by Prof. Songlin Wang established a model of miniature pigs to simulate clinical salivary gland injuries induced by radiation in the head and neck region. The model was employed in a series of studies on the mechanism of radiation-induced salivary gland injuries as well as functional reconstruction of the damaged glands.The team found that exogenous inorganic nitrate supplementation could significantly protect the morphology and function of the salivary glands from radiation injury, suggesting a novel mode of prevention and treatment.Most existing experimental studies on inorganic nitrate therapy are based on oral administration, including the addition of nitrates to food and drinking water. Orally administered nitrates have low bioavailability, rapid metabolism, and high fluctuation in vivo, making it difficult to achieve pharmacodynamically active concentrations. To resolve these issues and facilitate clinical applications, the team has successfully developed a drug combination prediction system based on swarm learning.Using a deep learning model, the system was trained on drug-pathway interaction data to construct a drug-pathway network. A graph convolutional neural network was used to construct a drug-target network to uncover optimal drug combinations. The system was used to successfully identify vitamin C as the optimal drug for co-administration with sodium nitrate. This finding provides new ideas and methods for drug co-administration, with important clinical implications for the prevention of various diseases.From this, the optimal nitrate-to-vitamin C ratio was determined using microencapsulation technology for screening and optimization of the controlled release formulation. Thereby a hydrophobic nanodrug named Nanonitrator was prepared, using a core material solution containing sodium nitrate, vitamin C, and chitosan 3000, whereas sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (Na-CMC) and pectin were used as wall materials.The core and wall materials were mixed, lyophilized, and crushed into a powder form. The various pH values of gastrointestinal solutions tested in vitro confirmed that Nanonitrator is suitable in oral dosage forms.Due to their ability to significantly enhance the signal transduction of the PI3K-Akt pathway, Nanonitrator exhibited better effects in maintaining intracellular homeostasis than sodium nitrate alone or sodium nitrate combined in a physical mixture with vitamin C at equivalent oral doses. Nanonitrator reduced radiation-induced oxidative stress in salivary gland cells, reduced ROS content, maintained cellular calcium homeostasis, protected mitochondrial morphology and function, and decreased the number of apoptotic cells.These results suggest that Nanonitrator could be developed as a novel therapy of multiple applications, with the potential to play an important role in the prevention and treatment of related chronic diseases. Moreover, this study provides new ideas for the development of novel drugs based on inorganic salts.The work is published in the journal Science Bulletin.

  "answer_squad": " Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate using Pd-Cu modified carbon nanotube membranes",
  "text": "The adverse effects of excess nitrate in water on human productivity and lives have received increasing attention due to the discharge of industrial wastewater and the overuse of farmland fertilizers. An international team of researchers has conducted an in-depth study of the significant need and challenge of efficient nitrate removal.          Several techniques have been used to eliminate nitrate from water, such as biological denitrification is technologically mature, cost-effective, and widely used. However, biological processes are often sluggish and easily affected by variable environmental conditions, such as temperature and the availability of carbon supplies. The researchers suggested that electrocatalytic technology is a promising method for nitrate removal because no chemicals are needed, no sludge is produced, and implementation of the methodology is convenient.Most of the electrodes currently used for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction are conventional plate cathodes implemented in parallel plate reactors where mass transfer is strongly limited. Consequently, the overall electrocatalytic nitrate reduction rate decreases. Novel reactive electrochemical membranes (REMs) for nitrate reduction had previously been reported, but the synthetic processes for these proposed materials are complicated and the high cost of preparation have hindered the practical application of REMs.To address these barriers, researchers from Minzu University of China and Wuhan University prepared a Pd-Cu modified carbon nanotube membrane was fabricated with an electrodeposition method and used to reduce nitrate in a flowthrough electrochemical reactor.Their study reveals that the membrane obtained with a Pd : Cu ratio of 1:1 exhibited a relatively high nitrate removal efficiency and N2 selectivity. This study entitled \"Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate using Pd-Cu modified carbon nanotube membranes\" is published online in Frontiers of Environmental Science & Engineering.In this study, the research team fabricated a novel Pd-Cu modified carbon nanotube membrane cathode on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) substrate to overcome the mass transfer problem during nitrate reduction.Initially, to determine the optimal potential for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction in flow-through mode, nitrate reduction was conducted with Pd-Cu modified CNT membranes with different potentials ranging from \u22122.0 to \u22120.4 V. The team noted that the optimal potential and duration for codeposition of Pd and Cu were \u22120.7 V and 5 min, respectively, according to linear scan voltammetry results for CNT membranes in different solutions.      The second question the team examined was the effect of the Pd-Cu molar ratio and electrode potential on nitrate removal. The team noted that the membrane obtained with a Pd : Cu ratio of 1:1 exhibited a relatively high nitrate removal efficiency and N2 selectivity.Nitrate was almost completely reduced (~99 %) by the membrane at potentials lower than \u22121.2 V. However, \u22120.8 V was the optimal potential for nitrate reduction in terms of both nitrate removal efficiency and product selectivity. The nitrate removal efficiency was 56.2 %, and the N2 selectivity was 23.8 % for the Pd : Cu=1:1 membrane operated at \u22120.8 V.The third question the team investigated was the effect of solution conditions. They noted that nitrate removal was enhanced under acidic conditions, while N2 selectivity was decreased. The concentrations of Cl\u2212 ions and dissolved oxygen showed little effect on nitrate reduction.In addition, to illustrate the effect of flow-through operation on mass transfer, the team evaluated the effect of membrane flux on nitrate reduction and calculated the mass transfer rate constants at different membrane fluxes.They note that the mass transfer rate constant was greatly improved by 6.6 times from 1.14 \u00d7 10\u22123 m/h at a membrane flux of 1 L/(m2\u00b7h) to 8.71 \u00d7 10\u22123 m/h at a membrane flux of 15 L/(m2\u00b7h), which resulted in a significant increase in the nitrate removal rate from 13.6 to 133.5 mg/(m2\u00b7h).Pd-Cu modified CNT membranes were successfully prepared via the electrodeposition method, and a flow-through electrocatalytic system was constructed to reduce nitrate in this study. This technology has broad application prospects for effective nitrate reduction and is worthy of further modification in practice.

  "text": "Getting something for nothing doesn't work in physics. But it turns out that, by thinking like a strategic gamer, and with some help from a demon, improved energy efficiency for complex systems like data centers might be possible.          In computer simulations, Stephen Whitelam of the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) used neural networks (a type of machine learning model that mimics human brain processes) to train nanosystems, which are tiny machines about the size of molecules, to work with greater energy efficiency.What's more, the simulations showed that learned protocols could draw heat from the systems by virtue of constantly measuring them to find the most energy efficient operations.\"We can get energy out of the system, or we can store work in the system,\" Whitelam said.It's an insight that could prove valuable, for example, in operating very large systems like computer data centers. Banks of computers produce enormous amounts of heat that must be extracted\u2014using still more energy\u2014to prevent damage to the sensitive electronics.Whitelam conducted the research at the Molecular Foundry, a DOE Office of Science user facility at Berkeley Lab. His work is described in a paper published in Physical Review X.Inspiration from Pac Man and Maxwell's DemonAsked about the origin of his ideas, Whitelam said, \"People had used techniques in the machine learning literature to play Atari video games that seemed naturally suited to materials science.\"In a video game like Pac Man, he explained, the aim with machine learning would be to choose a particular time for an action\u2014up, down, left, right, and so on\u2014to be performed. Over time, the machine learning algorithms will \"learn\" the best moves to make, and when, to achieve high scores. The same algorithms can work for nanoscale systems.Whitelam's simulations are also something of an answer to an old thought experiment in physics called Maxwell's Demon. Briefly, in 1867, physicist James Clerk Maxwell proposed a box filled with a gas, and in the middle of the box there would be a massless \"demon\" controlling a trap door. The demon would open the door to allow faster molecules of the gas to move to one side of the box and slower molecules to the opposite side.Eventually, with all molecules so segregated, the \"slow\" side of the box would be cold and the \"fast side\" would be hot, matching the energy of the molecules.      Checking the refrigeratorThe system would constitute a heat engine, Whitelam said. Importantly, however, Maxwell's Demon doesn't violate the laws of thermodynamics\u2014getting something for nothing\u2014because information is equivalent to energy. Measuring the position and speed of molecules in the box costs more energy than that derived from the resulting heat engine.And heat engines can be useful things. Refrigerators provide a good analogy, Whitelam said. As the system runs, food inside stays cold\u2014the desired outcome\u2014even though the back of the fridge gets hot as a product of work done by the refrigerator's motor.In Whitelam's simulations, the machine learning protocol can be thought of as the demon. In the process of optimization, it converts information drawn from the system modeled into energy as heat.Unleashing the demon on a nanoscale systemIn one simulation, Whitelam optimized the process of dragging a nanoscale bead through water. He modeled a so-called optical trap in which laser beams, acting like tweezers of light, can hold and move a bead around.\"The name of the game is: Go from here to there with as little work done on the system as possible,\" Whitelam said. The bead jiggles under natural fluctuations called Brownian motion as water molecules are bombarding it. Whitelam showed that if these fluctuations can be measured, moving the bead can then be done at the most energy efficient moment.\"Here we're showing that we can train a neural-network demon to do something similar to Maxwell's thought experiment but with an optical trap,\" he said.Cooling computersWhitelam extended the idea to microelectronics and computation. He used the machine learning protocol to simulate flipping the state of a nanomagnetic bit between 0 and 1, which is a basic information-erasure/information-copying operation in computing.\"Do this again, and again. Eventually, your demon will 'learn' how to flip the bit so as to absorb heat from the surroundings,\" he said. He comes back to the refrigerator analogy. \"You could make a computer that cools down as it runs, with the heat being sent somewhere else in your data center.\"Whitelam said the simulations are like a testbed for understanding concepts and ideas. \"And here the idea is just showing that you can perform these protocols, either with little energy expense, or energy sucked in at the cost of going somewhere else, using measurements that could apply in a real-life experiment,\" he said.

BAY-1082439, a specific inhibitor against phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) 110\u03b1 and 110\u03b2 subunits, can reverse P-gp-mediated MDR by down-regulating P-gp expression. However, BAY-1082439 has shortcomings such as poor water solubility, short half-life, and high clearance rate in vivo.A research group led by Prof. Chen Zhuo from the Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, has established a tumor targeting drug delivery nano-system PBDF [P: poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide)-Thiol (PLGA-SH); B: BAY-1082439; D: doxorubicin (DOX); F: Folic acid-polyethylene glycol-Thiol (FA-PEG-SH)].It comprises doxorubicin (DOX) and BAY-1082439 respectively encapsulated by biodegradable PLGA-SH nanoparticles (NPs) that are grafted to gold nanorods (Au NRs) modified with FA-PEG-SH, which can enhance the efficacy to reverse P-gp mediated MDR and to target tumor cells, and finally the efficiency to inhibit MDR tumors overexpressing P-gp. The study was published in Cancer Letters.\"Compared with free DOX combined with BAY-1082439, PBDF NPs significantly enhanced the uptake of DOX, improved the activity of reversing MDR, inhibited cell proliferation, and induced S-phase arrest and apoptosis of KB-C2 cells,\" said Prof. Chen.The in vivo animal experiments further confirmed that PBDF NPs enhanced the anti-tumor ability of DOX and inhibited the development of KB-C2 tumors.Besides, PBDF NPs inhibited the metastasis of KB-C2 cells in the liver and/or the lung of nude mice but had no obvious toxic effect on normal cells.This study develops an achievable and applicable targeted therapy strategy for MDR tumors with high biocompatibility and the potential to inhibit MDR tumor progression and tumor metastasis.

This technology is anticipated to contribute to the development of biomaterial devices for applications that require device transparency or are sensitive to temperature changes.          Recently, there has been significant interest in a \"transparent electrode\" that facilitates bio-imaging and is applicable in various sectors, such as optogenetics. However, ink material used in existing transparent electrodes, such as indium tin oxide (ITO) or antimony tin oxide (ATO), require processing temperatures of 350 \u2103 or above, which is higher than the transition temperature (150\u2013200 \u2103) of flexible boards.Therefore, using existing ink material to proceed with transparent electrode processing results in a mechanical weak point of the hardening of the flexible board due to the high temperature.Thus, the research team used inkjet printing technology with a high degree of freedom in pattern formation to propose a new method of fabricating a transparent ultra-thin-film gold fine electrode customized for patients. Unlike the existing method of directly printing ink, this technology involves inkjet printing of a polymeric seed layer to induce ganglia generation, and \"ultra-thin-film gold\" of 6 nm or below is evaporated without a photomask to selectively process a transparent electrode with high penetrance.Simultaneously, a \"non-conducting gold island layer\" is formed in the area where the polymeric seed layer is not printed, which can be implemented for photothermy. The research team proceeded with verification to identify the completeness of the developed nanostructure. Photothermy was detected using a transparent temperature sensor, and nerve cells were grown on the upper part of the device to identify both bio-suitability and potential for bio-imaging.The \"ultra-thin-film gold electrode and gold nanostructure\" developed in this study is advantageous compared to existing devices because processing is available at room temperature without using an exposure mask in the fields of engineering application and biomedicine where 'patient-customized flexible and wearable transparent electrode formation' is required.The research team anticipates that an expansion of these technologies could lead to successful thermotherapy based on photothermy, such as optics-based PCR, neuromodulation, cancer treatment, and drug delivery.DGIST Professor Hongki Kang of the Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science stated that \"the key is that this patient-customized 'ultra-thin-film gold electrode' can be produced using inkjet printing, which is different from the existing electrode formation method,\" and revealed that \"it is anticipated that various body signals could be more efficiently measured using this technology through a patient-customized flexible fine electrode array.\"The work is published in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.

The research has now been published in Nature Chemistry.          \"Conventional anti-cancer drugs often do not differentiate enough between good and bad cells,\" Bonnet explains. \"They kill them both.\" The researchers have come up with a solution to this problem: nanoparticles that target the tumor and only become active under the influence of visible light. \"This anticancer phototherapy allows doctors to treat a specific part of the body without damaging the rest. It is already in use in several hospitals.\"Molecules that form nanoparticles by themselvesUntil now, chemists had to first attach the chemotherapy drugs to nanoparticles in the lab. Doctors then administered them by injection into the patient's bloodstream. Conjugation to the nanoparticles helped the chemotherapy find the tumor. Zhou's drug works slightly differently. \"The lab work is no longer necessary,\" he says. \"You can administer the molecules directly. Once in the blood, nanoparticles then form all by themselves.\"And that has several advantages, says Zhou. \"First, it saves a lot of work and preparation time. But in addition, it is also safer and more effective.\" Making nanoparticles in the lab is complicated: it always creates a mix of particles with varied sizes and therefore different properties. It is difficult to precisely determine the composition of that mix. So you are never 100% sure how these particles are going to behave in your body.Zhou says, \"With a molecule, this is more straightforward: when you make molecules, chemical analysis allows you to determine whether they are pure.\" Bonnet adds, \"If you then inject these molecules into the blood, the resulting nanoparticles are all really similar. That is because the body processes those molecules all in the same way.\"Xuequan's molecule is a so-called palladium complex\u2014a molecule with a metallic core made of palladium. Normally, the palladium atom is connected to four nitrogen atoms, but Zhou replaced two of those nitrogen atoms with carbon atoms. When irradiated with green light, the palladium complex gains extra energy. That extra energy causes the complex to transfer electrons to the oxygen molecules (O2) already present in the irradiated cells. This mechanism creates a reactive oxygen species that kills cancer cells.      In 2020, Zhou also made a cancer drug with self-assembling properties. \"However, this new molecule is one step further,\" he says. \"By binding not one but two carbon atoms to the metal, the drug is now activated under green light, instead of blue.\" Green light allows better penetration into body tissue and is therefore much more useful for therapy in mice. \"Our ultimate goal is a drug that works under infrared light,\" says Bonnet. \"That light would allow even deeper penetration. It would allow us to fight larger tumors deep inside the body of human patients.\"This new study followed a better, clinically more relevant approach. In the first study, Zhou and his colleagues injected the drug directly into the tumor. \"This time we went a step further and looked in mouse models where the drug was injected into the bloodstream,\" he says. \"After all, this is also how it would be done in hospitals. We wanted to know whether the drug nanoparticles would survive the conditions in the body. And fortunately, that was the case.\"Zhou's molecule proved to be very effective. \"Ten percent of the administered drug reaches the tumor,\" says Bonnet. \"Out of every 100 molecules we administer, ten arrive at the destination. For many nanomedicines, that percentage is much lower. A study a few years ago showed that the average is only 0.7%.\"How exactly is this possible? Molecules that form nanoparticles by themselves? \"We don't exactly know that ourselves either,\" Bonnet admits. \"We know palladium is critical, and Xuequan discovered that proteins in the blood probably play a role as well. If those proteins are missing, the nanoparticles keep growing and become so big that they eventually no longer stay in solution. It hence seems that the proteins limit the growth of the nanoparticles, but we cannot yet precisely tell how. We know it is effective. That's the most important thing. But why it does work so well? That's what further research will have to show.\" More information:Xue-Quan Zhou et al, In vivo metallophilic self-assembly of a light-activated anticancer drug, Nature Chemistry (2023).

  "text": "Two-dimensional layered materials are a novel class of materials that exhibit strong and distinctive light-matter interactions, offering broad application prospects in optoelectronic devices and photonic elements. These materials encompass graphene, transition metal sulfides (TMDs), black phosphorus (BP), and others, which demonstrate exceptional performance characteristics such as ultrafast and wide-spectrum response, robust excitonic optical properties, and tunable direct optical band gaps.          MXenes represent a newly discovered class of two-dimensional layered materials that showcase fascinating and tunable optical, chemical, and electronic properties, and exhibit diverse applications in fields such as photoelectricity, photothermal conversion, and photovoltaics. Furthermore, MXenes demonstrate strong nonlinear optical responses, and their nonlinear optical absorption can be adjusted by thickness, excitation wavelength, and surface groups.In addition, the construction of two-dimensional heterostructures represents an important strategy for enhancing the optoelectronic performance of devices that utilize two-dimensional materials. By employing careful design, the advantageous properties of each component within the heterostructure can be preserved, while novel characteristics such as charge transfer or energy transfer can be generated via the interfacial effects.The authors of this article, published in Opto-Electronic Advances, propose a simple and effective method for preparing Nb2C/MoS2 heterostructures with enhanced both linear and nonlinear optical properties.In this work, MoS2 nanocrystals were successfully grown on the surface of Nb2C nanosheets in situ, resulting in the construction of a two-dimensional Nb2C/MoS2 heterostructure. It was found that this heterostructure outperformed pure Nb2C in both linear and nonlinear optics.The study reveals that the surface group of Nb2C can modulate the work function of Nb2C/MoS2, which affects the charge transfer and energy alignment between Nb2C and MoS2. As a result, Nb2C/MoS2 inherits the advantages of Nb2C and MoS2 at different wavelengths and exhibits enhanced broadband optical absorption characteristics.Furthermore, the research demonstrates that hole transfer from Nb2C to MoS2 leads to modulation of the nonlinear optical response in the heterostructure. It also proves that Nb2C/MoS2 has stronger and tunable near-infrared nonlinear optical absorption characteristics than pure Nb2C. The nonlinear absorption coefficient of Nb2C/MoS2 is more than twice that of pure Nb2C, as illustrated in Figure 1. This study presents an effective approach for the development of broadband optoelectronic devices and optical modulators. In particular, the findings provide a strong basis for the utilization of MXenes, which exhibit excellent photoelectric performance, in the field of optoelectronics.

  "question_squad": " What is the most important part of a quantum phenomenon?",
  "answer_squad": " spin structure",
  "text": "For two decades, physicists have tried to directly manipulate the spin of electrons in 2D materials like graphene. Doing so could spark key advances in the burgeoning world of 2D electronics, a field where super-fast, small and flexible electronic devices carry out computations based on quantum mechanics.          Standing in the way is that the typical way in which scientists measure the spin of electrons\u2014an essential behavior that gives everything in the physical universe its structure\u2014usually doesn't work in 2D materials. This makes it incredibly difficult to fully understand the materials and propel forward technological advances based on them. But a team of scientists led by Brown University researchers believe they now have a way around this longstanding challenge. They describe their solution in a new study published in Nature Physics.In the study, the team\u2014which also include scientists from the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies at Sandia National Laboratories, and the University of Innsbruck\u2014describe what they believe to be the first measurement showing direct interaction between electrons spinning in a 2D material and photons coming from microwave radiation.Called a coupling, the absorption of microwave photons by electrons establishes a novel experimental technique for directly studying the properties of how electrons spin in these 2D quantum materials\u2014one that could serve as a foundation for developing computational and communicational technologies based on those materials, according to the researchers.\"Spin structure is the most important part of a quantum phenomenon, but we've never really had a direct probe for it in these 2D materials,\" said Jia Li, an assistant professor of physics at Brown and senior author of the research. \"That challenge has prevented us from theoretically studying spin in these fascinating material for the last two decades. We can now use this method to study a lot of different systems that we could not study before.\"The researchers made the measurements on a relatively new 2D material called \"magic-angle\" twisted bilayer graphene. This graphene-based material is created when two sheets of ultrathin layers of carbon are stacked and twisted to just the right angle, converting the new double-layered structure into a superconductor that allows electricity to flow without resistance or energy waste. Just discovered in 2018, the researchers focused on the material because of the potential and mystery surrounding it.      \"A lot of the major questions that were posed in 2018 have still yet to be answered,\" said Erin Morissette, a graduate student in Li's lab at Brown who led the work.Physicists usually use nuclear magnetic resonance or NMR to measure the spin of electrons. They do this by exciting the nuclear magnetic properties in a sample material using microwave radiation and then reading the different signatures this radiation causes to measure spin.The challenge with 2D materials is that the magnetic signature of electrons in response to the microwave excitation is too small to detect. The research team decided to improvise. Instead of directly detecting the magnetization of the electrons, they measured subtle changes in electronic resistance, which were caused by the changes in magnetization from the radiation using a device fabricated at the Institute for Molecular and Nanoscale Innovation at Brown.These small variations in the flow of the electronic currents allowed the researchers to use the device to detect that the electrons were absorbing the photos from the microwave radiation.The researchers were able to observe novel information from the experiments. The team noticed, for instance, that interactions between the photons and electrons made electrons in certain sections of the system behave as they would in an anti-ferromagnetic system\u2014meaning the magnetism of some atoms was canceled out by a set of magnetic atoms that are aligned in a reverse direction.The new method for studying spin in 2D materials and the current findings won't be applicable to technology today, but the research team sees potential applications the method could lead to in the future. They plan to continue to apply their method to twisted bilayer graphene but also expand it to other 2D material.\"It's a really diverse toolset that we can use to access an important part of the electronic order in these strongly correlated systems and in general to understand how electrons can behave in 2D materials,\" Morissette said.

  "answer_race": " New 3D sensor captures 3D images at high resolution",
  "question_squad": " What is the range of angular resolution for a 3D imaging sensor?",
  "answer_squad": " more than 80 degrees",
  "text": "A research team from the National University of Singapore (NUS) Faculty of Science, led by Professor Liu Xiaogang from the Department of Chemistry, has developed a 3D imaging sensor that has an extremely high angular resolution, which is the capacity of an optical instrument to distinguish points of an object separated by a small angular distance, of 0.0018o. This innovative sensor operates on a unique angle-to-color conversion principle, allowing it to detect 3D light fields across the X-ray to visible light spectrum.          A light field encompasses the combined intensity and direction of light rays, which the human eyes can process to precisely detect the spatial relationship between objects. Traditional light sensing technologies, however, are less effective. Most cameras, for instance, can only produce two-dimensional images, which is adequate for regular photography but insufficient for more advanced applications, including virtual reality, self-driving cars, and biological imaging. These applications require precise 3D scene construction of a particular space.For example, self-driving cars could use light-field sensing to view streets and more accurately assess road hazards so as to adjust their speed accordingly. Light-field sensing could also enable surgeons to accurately image a patient's anatomy at varying depths, allowing them to make more precise incisions and better assess a patient's risk of injury.\"Currently, light-field detectors use an array of lenses or photonic crystals to obtain multiple images of the same space from many different angles. However, integrating these elements into semiconductors for practical use is complicated and costly,\" explained Prof Liu. \"Conventional technologies can detect light fields only in the ultraviolet to visible light wavelength range, leading to limited applicability in X-ray sensing.\"In addition, compared with other light-field sensors such as microlens arrays, the NUS team's light field sensor has a larger angular measurement range of more than 80 degrees, high angular resolution which can potentially be less than 0.015 degrees for smaller sensors, and a wider spectral response range of between 0.002 nm and 550 nm. These specifications make the novel sensor able to capture 3D images at higher depth resolution. The breakthrough was published in Nature on May 10, 2023.Made possible by perovskite nanocrystalsAt the core of the novel light-field sensor are inorganic perovskite nanocrystals\u2014compounds that have excellent optoelectronic properties. Due to their controllable nanostructures, perovskite nanocrystals are efficient light emitters, with an excitation spectrum that spans X-rays to visible light. The interactions between perovskite nanocrystals and light rays can also be tuned by carefully altering their chemical properties or by introducing small amounts of impurity atoms.                Design (left) and output (right) of 3D light-field sensor. The designed device (left) encodes the light field as color output. Patterned perovskite nanocrystals arrays convert different directions of light into different colors, which can be detected by a color charge-coupled device camera. The right image shows a reconstructed 3D depth image of a Merlion model produced by the camera. Credit: Yi Luying             NUS researchers have patterned perovskite crystals onto a transparent thin-film substrate and integrated them into a color charge-coupled device (CCD), which converts incoming light signals into a color-coded output. This crystal-converter system comprises a basic functional unit of the light-field sensor.When incident light hits the sensor, the nanocrystals become excited. In turn, the perovskite units emit their own light in varying colors depending on the angle at which the incoming light ray strikes. The CCD captures the emitted color, which can then be used for 3D image reconstruction.\"A single angle value, however, is not enough to determine the absolute position of the object in a three-dimensional space,\" shared by Dr. Yi Luying, Research Fellow at the NUS Department of Chemistry and the first author of the paper. \"We discovered that adding another basic crystal converter unit perpendicular to the first detector and combining it with a designed optical system could provide even more spatial information regarding the object in question.\"They then tested their light-field sensor in proof-of-concept experiments and found that their approach can indeed capture 3D images\u2014with accurate reconstructions of depth and dimension\u2014of objects placed 1.5 meters away.Their experiments also demonstrated the capacity of the novel light-field sensor to resolve even very fine details. For example, a precise image of a computer keyboard was created that even captured the shallow protrusions of individual keys.      Future researchProf Liu and his team are looking into methods to improve the spatial accuracy and resolution of their light-field sensor, such as using higher-end color detectors. The team has also applied for an international patent for the technology.\"We will also explore more advanced technologies to pattern perovskite crystals more densely onto the transparent substrate, which could lead to better spatial resolution. Using materials other than perovskite may also expand the detection spectrum of the light-field sensor,\" said Prof Liu.

  "answer_squad": " Nano-SCHeMe",
  "text": "Northwestern University engineers have developed a new sponge that can remove metals\u2014including toxic heavy metals like lead and critical metals like cobalt\u2014from contaminated water, leaving safe, drinkable water behind.          In proof-of-concept experiments, the researchers tested their new sponge on a highly contaminated sample of tap water, containing more than 1 part per million of lead. With one use, the sponge filtered lead to below detectable levels.After using the sponge, researchers also were able to successfully recover metals and reuse the sponge for multiple cycles. The new sponge shows promise for future use as an inexpensive, easy-to-use tool in home water filters or large-scale environmental remediation efforts.The study was published May 10 in the journal ACS ES&T Water. The paper outlines the new research and sets design rules for optimizing similar platforms for removing\u2014and recovering\u2014other heavy-metal toxins, including cadmium, arsenic, cobalt and chromium.\"The presence of heavy metals in the water supply is an enormous public health challenge for the entire globe,\" said Northwestern's Vinayak Dravid, senior author of the study and Abraham Harris Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering and director of global initiatives at the International Institute for Nanotechnology. \"It is a gigaton problem that requires solutions that can be deployed easily, effectively and inexpensively. That's where our sponge comes in. It can remove the pollution and then be used again and again.\"Sopping up spillsThe project builds on Dravid's previous work to develop highly porous sponges for various aspects of environmental remediation. In May 2020, his team unveiled a new sponge designed to clean up oil spills. The nanoparticle-coated sponge, which is now being commercialized by Northwestern spinoff MFNS Tech, offers a more efficient, economic, ecofriendly and reusable alternative to current approaches to oil spills.But Dravid knew it wasn't enough.\"When there is an oil spill, you can remove the oil,\" he said. \"But there also are toxic heavy metals\u2014like mercury, cadmium, sulfur and lead\u2014in those spills. So, even when you remove the oil, some of the other toxins might remain.\"      Rinse and repeat To tackle this aspect of the issue, Dravid's team, again, turned to sponges coated with an ultrathin layer of nanoparticles. After testing many different types of nanoparticles, the team found that a manganese-doped goethite coating worked best. Not only are manganese-doped goethite nanoparticles inexpensive to make, easily available and nontoxic to human, they also have the properties necessary to selectively remediate heavy metals.\"You want a material with a high surface area, so there's more room for the lead ions to stick to it,\" said Benjamin Shindel, a Ph.D. student in Dravid's lab and the paper's first author. \"These nanoparticles have high-surface areas and abundant reactive surface sites for adsorption and are stable, so they can be reused many times.\"The team synthesized slurries of manganese-doped goethite nanoparticles, as well as several other compositions of nanoparticles, and coated commercially available cellulose sponges with these slurries. Then, they rinsed the coated sponges with water in order to wash away any loose particles. The final coatings measured just tens of nanometers in thickness.When submerged into contaminated water, the nanoparticle-coated sponge effectively sequestered lead ions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires that bottled drinking water is below 5 parts per billion of lead. In filtration trials, the sponge lowered the amount of lead to approximately 2 parts per billion, making it safe to drink.\"We're really happy with that,\" Shindel said. \"Of course, this performance can vary based on several factors. For instance, if you have a large sponge in a tiny volume of water, it will perform better than a tiny sponge in a huge lake.\"Recovery bypasses mining From there, the team rinsed the sponge with mildly acidified water, which Shindel likened to \"having the same acidity of lemonade.\" The acidic solution caused the sponge to release the lead ions and be ready for another use. Although the sponge's performance declined after the first use, it still recovered more than 90% of the ions during subsequent use cycles.This ability to gather and then recover heavy metals is particularly valuable for removing rare, critical metals, such as cobalt, from water sources. A common ingredient in lithium-ion batteries, cobalt is energetically expensive to mine and accompanied by a laundry list of environmental and human costs.If researchers could develop a sponge that selectively removes rare metals, including cobalt, from water, then those metals could be recycled into products like batteries.\"For renewable energy technologies, like batteries and fuel cells, there is a need for metal recovery,\" Dravid said. \"Otherwise, there is not enough cobalt in the world for the growing number of batteries. We must find ways to recover metals from very dilute solutions. Otherwise, it becomes poisonous and toxic, just sitting there in the water. We might as well make something valuable with it.\"Standardized scaleAs a part of the study, Dravid and his team set new design rules to help others develop tools to target particular metals, including cobalt. Specifically, they pinpointed which low-cost and nontoxic nanoparticles also have high-surface areas and affinities for sticking to metal ions. They studied the performance of coatings of manganese, iron, aluminum and zinc oxides on lead adsorption. Then, they established relationships between the structures of these nanoparticles and their adsorptive properties.Called Nanomaterial Sponge Coatings for Heavy Metals (or \"Nano-SCHeMe\"), the environmental remediation platform can help other researchers differentiate which nanomaterials are best suited for particular applications.\"I've read a lot of literature that compares different coatings and adsorbents,\" said Caroline Harms, an undergraduate student in Dravid's lab and paper co-author. \"There really is a lack of standardization in the field. By analyzing different types of nanoparticles, we developed a comparative scale that actually works for all of them. It could have a lot of implications in moving the field forward.\"Dravid and his team imagine that their sponge could be used in commercial water filters, for environmental clean-up or as an added step in water reclamation and treatment facilities.\"This work may be pertinent to water quality issues both locally and globally,\" Shindel said. \"We want to see this out in the world, where it can make a real impact.\" More information:Benjamin Shindel et al, Nano-SCHeMe: Nanomaterial Sponge Coatings for Heavy Metals, an Environmental Remediation Platform, ACS ES&T Water (2023).

  "answer_squad": " acrylonitrile butadiene styrene",
  "text": "Researchers have used a common disinfectant and antiseptic to create a new antimicrobial coating material that effectively kills bacteria and viruses, including MRSA and COVID-19.          Scientists at the University of Nottingham's School of Pharmacy took chlorhexidine, often used by dentists to treat mouth infections and for pre-surgical cleaning, and used it to coat the polymer, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). The new study, published in Nano Select, shows that this new material was found to be effective in killing the microbes responsible for a range of infections and illnesses and could be used as an effective antimicrobial coating on a range of plastic products.Plastics are widely used in medical settings, from intravenous bags and implantable devices to hospital beds and toilet seats. Some microbial species can survive in a hospital setting despite enhanced cleaning regimes, leading to an increased risk of patients getting infections while in the hospital and then needing antibiotic treatment. These microorganisms can survive and remain infectious on abiotic surfaces, including plastic surfaces, for extended periods, sometimes up to several months.\"As plastic is such a widely used material that we know can harbor infectious microorganisms we wanted to investigate a way to use this material to destroy the bacteria. We achieved this by bonding a disinfectant with the polymer to create a new coating material and discovered not only does it act very quickly, killing bacteria within 30 minutes, it also doesn't spread into the environment or leach from the surface when touched. Making plastic items using this material could really help tackle the issue of antibiotic resistance and reduce hospital acquired infections,\" says Dr. Felicity de Cogan, assistant professor in Pharmaceutical Science of Biological Medicines.The researchers used a special imaging technique called Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) to examine the material at molecular level. This revealed the material was antimicrobial and rapidly killed microbes and after 45 minutes the surfaces were still clear of these microbes. It was also effective against SARS-COV-2, with no viable virions found after 30 minutes. Additionally, the surfaces were also effective in killing chlorhexidine-resistant strains of bacteria.The COVID-19 pandemic has drawn increased attention to hospital-acquired infections, as it has been estimated that 20% of all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 contracted the virus while already in the hospital. It has been estimated that in 2016/17, 4.7% of adult hospital inpatients contracted an infection while in the hospital, with 22,800 patients dying due to these infections despite these deaths being preventable. The most common pathogens that cause hospital-acquired infections are Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium difficile. Outbreaks of infection in the clinic are frequently caused by strains resistant to antimicrobial drugs.Dr. de Cogan states, \"Research has shown that contaminated surfaces, including plastic surfaces, can act as a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes, encouraging the spread of antimicrobial resistance across bacterial species through horizontal gene transfer despite deep cleaning practices. It is paramount that new technologies are developed to prevent the spread of pathogenic microorganisms to vulnerable patients and address the ever-increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance.\"This research offers an effective way to do this and the material could be added to plastic materials during manufacture, it could also potentially be used as a spray.\" More information:Rowan Watson et al, Development of biocide coated polymers and their antimicrobial efficacy, Nano Select (2023).

  "text": "A novel type of protein nanoparticle vaccine formulation containing influenza proteins and adjuvant to boost immune responses has provided complete protection against influenza viral challenges, according to a new study published by researchers in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State University.          The findings published in the journal Small describe a promising influenza vaccine candidate that uses adjuvants, substances that increase immune response to a vaccine, to boost effectiveness against viral infections.The researchers developed a novel type of core/shell protein nanoparticle consisting of influenza nucleoprotein as the core and NA1-M2e or NA2-M2e surface proteins as the coating antigens. In the new nanoparticle fabrication, the surface protein coating can be precisely controlled and any excessive coating proteins can be recovered for reuse.Thus, nanoparticle quality and yield are improved significantly. Mice were intramuscularly or intranasally vaccinated with the resulting protein nanoparticles with and without immune-stimulating complexes as adjuvants to determine the immune response and protective efficiency against influenza viral infections.\"We found that the novel protein nanoparticles combined with the adjuvants could induce significantly improved mucosal immune responses and the accumulation of lung resident memory cells in the local respiratory tracts, providing complete protection against influenza viral infections,\" said Dr. Wandi Zhu, first author of the study and a research assistant professor in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State.Influenza A virus is one of the most threatening respiratory pathogens and can cause severe morbidity, mortality and heavy economic burdens, especially in flu epidemics or pandemics. While vaccination is effective in preventing or reducing viral infections during annual flu seasons, the selection of vaccine strains depends on circulating viral surveillance and prediction.Mismatched strains could significantly impair vaccine efficiency. Also, the production of the current quadrivalent influenza vaccine is time-consuming. New vaccine technologies are needed to easily manufacture a universal influenza vaccine. The researchers have focused their work on developing different types of protein nanoparticle vaccines against both influenza A and influenza B viral infections.\"The epidemics caused by the influenza virus seriously threaten public health and the economy,\" said Dr. Baozhong Wang, senior author of the study and Distinguished University Professor in the Institute for Biomedical Sciences at Georgia State. \"Adding appropriate adjuvants to improve immunogenicity and finding effective mucosal vaccines to combat respiratory infection at the portal of virus entry are important strategies to boost protection.\"Adjuvanted protein nanoparticles could improve strong systemic and mucosal immune responses conferring protection in different immunization routes. This work highlights the importance of applying adjuvants in mucosal vaccine formulations. The adjuvanted protein nanoparticles can be used as mucosal vaccines alone or in combination with other vaccines to improve mucosal immunity and protection in the future, Zhu explained.\"The new surface protein coating is a more controlled and efficient fabrication method than our previous process, significantly increasing the utilization of the initial proteins,\" Zhu said. \"The technique could be used to develop universal influenza vaccines consisting of influenza antigens from influenza A and influenza B viruses.

  "text": "Implantable bioelectrodes are electronic devices that can monitor or stimulate biological activity by transmitting signals to and from living biological systems. Such devices can be fabricated using various materials and techniques. But, because of their intimate contact and interactions with living tissues, selection of the right material for performance and biocompatibility is crucial. In recent times, conductible hydrogels have attracted great attention as bioelectrode materials owing to their flexibility, compatibility, and excellent interaction ability.          However, the absence of injectability and degradability in conventional conductive hydrogels limits their convenience of use and performance in biological systems.Against this backdrop, researchers from Korea have now developed graphene-based conductive hydrogels possessing injectability and tunable degradability, furthering the design and development of advanced bioelectrodes. The study was led by Professor Jae Young Lee from Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) and was published in Small.Explaining the rationale for their study, Prof. Lee says, \"Traditional implantable electrodes frequently cause several problems, such as large incision for implantation and uncontrolled stability in the body. In contrast, conductive hydrogel materials allow minimally invasive delivery and control over the bioelectrode's functional in vivo lifespan and are thus highly desired.\"To synthesize the injectable conductive hydrogels (ICHs), the researchers used thiol-functionalized reduced graphene oxide (F-rGO) as the conductive component due to its large surface area and excellent electrical and mechanical properties.They selected dimaleimide (PEG-2Mal)- and diacrylate (PEG-2Ac)-functionalized polyethylene glycol as prepolymers to facilitate the development of ICHs that are stable and hydrolysable, respectively. These prepolymers were then subjected to thiol-ene reactions with poly (ethylene glycol)-tetrathiol (PEG-4SH) and F-rGO.ICHs made with PEG-2Ac were degradable (DICH), while those with PEG-2Mal were stable (SICH). The researchers found that the novel ICHs outperformed various existing ones by binding extremely well to tissues and recording the highest signals. Under in vitro conditions (outside a living organism), SICH did not degrade for a month, while DICH showed gradual degradation from the third day onwards.When implanted onto mouse skin, DICH disappeared after three days of administration, whereas SICH retained its shape for up to 7 days. In addition to controlled degradability, both ICHs were skin-compatible.Additionally, the team evaluated the ability of the ICHs to record in vivo electromyography signals in rat muscle and skin. Both SICH and DICH recorded high-quality signals and surpassed the performance of traditional metal electrodes. The SICH recordings could be monitored up to three weeks, whereas DICH signals were completely lost after five days. These findings suggest the applicability of SICH electrodes for long-term signal monitoring and that of DICH for temporary use requiring no surgical removal.Summarizing these results, Prof. Lee says, \"The novel graphene-based ICH electrodes developed by us incorporate features like high signal sensitivity, simplicity of use, minimal invasiveness, and tunable degradability. Altogether, these properties can assist in the development of advanced bioelectronics and functional implantable bioelectrodes for a variety of medical conditions, such as neuromuscular diseases and neurological disorders.\" More information:Junggeon Park et al, Injectable Conductive Hydrogels with Tunable Degradability as Novel Implantable Bioelectrodes, Small (2023).

  "text": "Vanderbilt researchers are bolstering the fight against cancer with technology that enhances the effectiveness of T cells that attack tumors. The cutting-edge research was recently published in the journal Science Immunology.          Cancers co-opt both the immune and cardiovascular systems to fuel their own growth, researchers say. They do this in part by forming new blood vessels that provide essential nutrients to rapidly dividing cancer cells. T cells in the immune system also use blood vessels as conduits for finding and invading tumors. But vessels in tumors are often abnormal and put up barricades that impede the ability of T cells to locate and kill cancer cells.However, using a nanotechnology invented in the Immunoengineering Lab at Vanderbilt, researchers discovered they could reverse\u2014or normalize\u2014the malformed tumor vasculature by activating the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, a component of the immune system that plays an important role in protecting against pathogen infection and the development of cancers.John T. Wilson, associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at Vanderbilt and a corresponding author on the paper, said that the ability of the technology to reprogram the vasculature of tumors can help make T cells more effective at eradicating cancer cells.\"This allowed T cells to better infiltrate and destroy tumors in mouse models of kidney and breast cancer and enhanced the efficacy of immunotherapies that are currently being used in patients,\" said Wilson, who is also Principal Investigator of the Immunoengineering Lab and a Chancellor Faculty Fellow.In the publication, researchers also discuss testing their STING-activating nanoparticle (STAN) technology on tumors that had been surgically removed from patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Consistent with findings from their experiments with mice, they found that STANs \"demonstrated superior immunostimulatory activity,\" offering \"initial evidence supporting the potential use of STANs as a strategy to coordinate antitumor innate immunity and vascular remodeling in human RCC.\"Such breakthroughs are needed. This year, nearly two million new cancer cases and more than 600,000 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society.\"While this technology isn't yet ready for use in cancer patients, our study revealed an exciting new strategy for improving responses to cancer immunotherapy,\" said Wilson.

  "answer_squad": " oxidative stress",
  "text": "Mitochondria are microscopic organelles found within cells, and are by far the largest producer of the molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides energy to many processes in living cells. The process by which mitochondria synthesize ATP generates a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), chemical groups that are highly reactive.          In a healthy cell, the ROS are controlled by the mitochondria; however, when this balance is lost, the excess ROS damages the mitochondria and subsequently cells and tissues. This phenomenon, known as oxidative stress, can cause premature aging and disease. The ROS that cause oxidative stress can be controlled by antioxidants.A research team led by Professor Yuma Yamada, Distinguished Professor Hideyoshi Harashima and Assistant Professor Mitsue Hibino at Hokkaido University have developed a system to deliver antioxidants to mitochondria to mitigate the effects of excess ROS. Their findings have been published in Scientific Reports.\"We previously developed a drug delivery system which we named CoQ10-MITO-Porter,\" explained Hibino. \"This system consists of the antioxidant molecule Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)\u2014which is also required by mitochondria for ATP production\u2014encapsulated by a lipid nanoparticle that would target mitochondria. In this study, we aimed to test if this system could work in living organisms.\"                Damage to the liver induced by acetaminophen (dotted blue outlines) is almost completely mitigated by CoQ10-MITO-Porter (right), compared to the effect of phosphate buffered saline (left) and direct administration of CoQ10(center). Credit: Mitsue Hibino, et al. Scientific Reports. May 10, 2023             Variations of the formula for the synthesis of CoQ10-MITO-Porter were tested, and their structures were examined with electron microscopy. CoQ10-MITO-Porter was administered to mice models with acetaminophen-induced liver damage. Acetaminophen overdoses cause excess ROS in mitochondria, which in turn damages cells in the liver. CoQ10-MITO-Porter was transported primarily to the liver and measurably reduced the damage caused by ROS. A further discovery was that downsized CoQ10-MITO-Porter particles with more efficient packaging of CoQ10 were more effective at treating liver damage than the original formulation.\"Our study has shown that the MITO-Porter system we developed can be used to deliver CoQ10 to the liver, making it an important therapeutic strategy against conditions that cause oxidative stress,\" concluded Yamada. \"Our future work will focus on elucidating the mechanism responsible for the therapeutic effect of CoQ10.\" More information:Mitsue Hibino et al, A System that Delivers an Antioxidant to Mitochondria for the treatment of Drug-Induced Liver Injury, Scientific Reports (2023).

  "answer_squad": " expansion microscopy",
  "text": "Led by Stefan Wilhelm, Ph.D., assistant professor in the Stephenson School of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Oklahoma, a team of researchers from the Gallogly College of Engineering at OU, OU Health Sciences Center and Yale University recently published an article in ACS Nano that describes their development of a super-resolution imaging platform technology to improve understanding of how nanoparticles interact within cells.          As technology-driven capabilities in engineering and healthcare are ever-increasing, scientists and engineers are developing new technologies to advance the future of health. One such area, nanomedicine, explores the use of nanoparticles for drug delivery in the body to fight against infectious diseases or cancer.The assessment of these nanomedicines in cells, tissues and organs is often performed by optical imaging, which can have a limited quality of imaging resolution. New imaging technologies are needed to see nanoparticles in their 3D ultrastructural context within biological tissues.\"To see nanomedicines in biological samples, researchers either use electron microscopy, which provides excellent spatial resolution but lacks 3D imaging capabilities, or optical microscopy, which achieves excellent 3D imaging, but exhibits relatively low spatial resolution,\" Wilhelm said.\"We demonstrate that we can perform 3D imaging of biological samples with electron microscopy-like resolution. This technique, called super-resolution imaging, allows us to see nanomedicines inside individual cells. Using this new super-resolution imaging method, we can now start to track and monitor nanoparticles inside cells, which is a prerequisite for designing nanomedicines that are safer and more efficient in reaching certain areas within cells.\"The researchers applied a 3D super-resolution imaging technique known as expansion microscopy which involves embedding cells within swellable hydrogels. Like water-absorbing materials used in diapers, the hydrogel materials physically expand up to 20-fold their original size upon contact with water.\"This expansion enables the imaging of cells with a lateral resolution of approximately 10 nanometers using a conventional optical microscope,\" Wilhelm said. \"We combined this method with an approach to image metallic nanoparticles within cells. Our approach exploits the inherent ability of metallic nanoparticles to scatter light. We used the scattered light to image and quantify nanoparticles inside cells without the need for any additional nanoparticle labels.\"The authors suggest their super-resolution imaging platform technology could be used to improve the engineering of safer and more effective nanomedicines to advance the translation of these technologies into the clinic.

  "text": "Researchers at FHAIVE (Finnish Hub for Development and Validation of Integrated Approaches), Tampere University, have discovered a new response mechanism specific to exposure to nanoparticles that is common to multiple species.          By analyzing a large collection of datasets concerning the molecular response to nanomaterials, Doctoral Researcher Giusy del Giudice has revealed an ancestral epigenetic mechanism of defense that explains how different species, from humans to simpler creatures, adapt over time to this type of exposure.The results of the research coordinated by Professor Dario Greco of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Technologies are presented in the paper \"An Ancestral Molecular Response to Nanomaterial Particulates,\" recently published in Nature Nanotechnology.\"We have demonstrated for the first time that there is a specific response to nanoparticles, and it is interlinked to their nano-properties. This study sheds light on how various species respond to particulate matters in a similar manner. It proposes a solution to the one-chemical-one-signature problem, currently limiting the use of toxicogenomic in chemical safety assessment,\"  Director of the FHAIVE, Professor of Bioinformatics at Tampere University Dario Greco says.Linking nanoparticles and immunityThe implications of this study go beyond the field of toxicology. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of immune activation in predicting the clinical outcome of a viral infection. In more polluted areas, COVID-19 had a more severe impact on the human population.\"Our results uncover an important link between understanding the basic defense mechanisms in living organisms and their immune functions,\" Greco points out.\"When it comes to drugs or viruses, we have understood that any exposure or infection leaves a trace on our immune system, and that this trace will affect the way we respond to future agents. Now, we have evidence that even particulate matter primes our immunity,\" says Giusy del Giudice, the first author of the scientific publication.The detrimental effects of air pollution on respiratory functions have been long known, but only recently scientists from The Francis Crick Institute proved it to be among the driving causes of lung cancer in non-smokers. In both cases, COVID-19 and lung cancer, the impact of particulate on the immune system contributed to these effects.\"The association between particulate matter and immune activation is of utmost importance and may lead to crucial epidemiological implications,\" del Giudice says.A step closer to planetary healthAnother important lesson learned from the COVID-19 pandemic concerns the concept of planetary health: all living organisms on the Earth are interconnected, and the effects on one specie will eventually propagate to others. In this regard, the results of this study open also new avenues to formulate integrated models that predict the effects of chemical exposures on many species at a time.\"Our results move in this direction by describing fundamental defense mechanisms common to many species throughout the tree of life,\" del Giudice says.Nanotechnology plays an important part in many fields, from biomedicine to energy and climate. Engineered nanomaterials are chemical substances or materials with particle sizes just between 1 to 100 nanometers, one third of the width of a human hair.Currently, thousands of consumer products contain nanomaterials, which requires testing their possible health and environmental effects. Because traditional toxicology relies on animal or in vitro tests to monitor phenotypic changes in response to exposures, it cannot keep in pace with this technological development.\"We cannot test every new nanomaterial on every possible species on Earth. We need innovative ways to reliably assess possible dangerous products as quickly as possible. Scientific evidence such as the one generated in this study can help to develop new models that do not require large amounts of animal experiments,\" Grego says.

  "text": "Quantum advances rely on the production of nanoscale wires that are based on several state-of-the-art nanolithographic technologies, to develop wires via bottom-up synthesis. However, a critical challenge is to grow uniform atomic crystalline wires and construct network structures to build nanocircuits.          In a new report in Science Advances, Tomoya Asaba and a team of researchers in physics and materials science at the Kyoto University, the University of Tokyo in Japan, and the Institute of Theoretical Physics in Germany, discovered a simple method to develop atomic-scale wires in the shape of nano-rings, stripes and X-/Y- junctions.Using pulsed-laser-deposition, the physicists and materials scientists grew single crystalline, atomic-scale wires of a Mott insulator, which maintained a bandgap comparable to wide-gap semiconductors. Such wires were a unit cell in thickness and a few microns in length. The researchers observed atomic pattern formation through non-equilibrium reaction-diffusion processes to offer a hitherto unknown perspective on the phenomena of atomic-scale self-organization to gain insight to the formation of quantum architecture in nano-networks.New methods to engineer atomic-scale nanowiresThe basic features of most technical devices change when their dimensions are reduced. When a device is reduced to the nanoscale, the fabrication and integration of one-dimensional wire patterns become increasingly complex. Developing top-down approaches with large-scale equipment such as electron beam and focused ion beam lithography to include nanowires with a thickness and width less than 10 nanometers is another technical challenge.Similarly, bottom-up technologies that use self-assembly processes cannot effectively determine the uniformity of the wires either. During bottom-up engineering, nanowire array integration depends on two complicated steps of growing randomly oriented nanowires first, and then aligning them into an array; therefore, this calls for a new approach to fabricate uniform, atomic-scale wires, and engineer nanopatterns.                Topographic images of \u03b2-RuCl3 atomic-scale wires grown on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surfaces.

DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abq5561             In this work, Asaba and colleagues engineered uniform and long, single-crystalline wires of ruthenium trichloride (RuCl3) at the atomic scale via a simple deposition method. They manufactured several characteristic patterns necessary to realize quantum nanocircuits including atomically smooth junctions and nanorings. The ruthenium trichloride material is interesting as a Mott insulator where electron-electron interactions open an energy gap. The team formed and integrated the nanowire patterns as part of a thin-film growth process, thereby diverging from the conventional method behind atomic scale wire patterns\u2014to promote self-organization instead.      Engineering nanocircuitsDuring the experiments, the team melted the ruthenium trichloride on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite surfaces by using pulsed-laser-deposition and observed the outcome with scanning tunneling microscopy. They obtained an atomic-resolution image of a sample grown at intense deposition temperatures to detect a surface covered by a unique pattern of wires. While each wire consisted of periodically spaced atoms, they noted a single crystalline structure. The materials scientists then studied the material forming the atomic-scale wires by extending the deposition time to grow a two-dimensional monolayer and thicker films and verified its composition to be crystallized ruthenium trichloride.

Their lengths are longer than 3 \u03bcm. The high clusters are objects adhering to the surface probably during the growth process. The topographic image was taken at 3 V and 20 pA. Credit: Science Advances (2023).  DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abq5561             The atomic wires maintained a length exceeding 3 micrometers as a unique and unprecedented feature. They also contained two or four ruthenium trichloride single crystalline chains growing on pyrolytic graphite surfaces. In its constitution, the wires consisted of quadrupole chains of the material at first, which later reduced to double chains with decreasing temperatures to form atomically smooth junctions and rings without defects and clusters to eventually engineer the nanocircuits.Characterizing the nanocircuitsThe materials scientists next studied the electronic structure of the materials by measuring differential tunneling conductance, and compared the outcomes with various forms of the material and pyrolytic graphite surfaces. They noted clear energetic gaps in ruthenium trichloride, indicative of semiconducting or insulating electronic structures.They unveiled the origin of the energy gap through systematic band calculations of variant forms of ruthenium trichloride materials, including a two-chain wire and its monolayer, and bulk forms, to observe electron correlations and spin-orbit interactions. The material eventually revealed an open energy gap at the Fermi energy across all experimental constructs used in the study to confirm the material as a Mott insulator.

(G) The periodicity (the inverse of the wave number) is plotted as a function of the number of pulses. The dashed gray line indicates the width of the four-chain wire. The data point for the 20 shots represents the lateral lattice constant of monolayer \u03b2-RuCl3. Credit: Science Advances (2023).  DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abq5561             Mechanisms of pattern formationThe team credited the formation of the nanowire array to thin-film growth that differed from any process hitherto known. Aside from stripe patterns observed during the experiments, the team discussed the mechanisms underlying pattern formation and the emergence of several distinct characteristic features. According to the patterns, static interactions were not the driving force of the atomic-wire array.Instead, they credited the feature to non-equilibrium reaction-diffusion processes. Since scanning tunneling microscopy was too slow to capture the dynamic processes of thin-film growth, the team expect to conduct direct measurements of the dynamic process at the atomic scale to fully understand the growth mechanism.                Schematic diagrams of the atomic-wire formation by Turing mechanism. (A) Activator-depleted substrate scheme. Depletion of the substrate acts as an inhibitor in the conventional activator-inhibitor system in the Turing mechanism. (B and C) Crystal growth and diffusion process of \u03b2-RuCl3. The chemical reaction process occurs on both sides of the 1D wires to form and decompose \u03b2-RuCl3, but the reaction is activated more frequently on the side with a higher concentration of a-Ru-Cl. The atomic wires propagate toward the direction with a higher concentration of a-Ru-Cl. This process describes the reaction-diffusion origin of the pattern formation. Credit: Science Advances (2023).  DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abq5561             OutlookIn this way, Tomoya Asaba and colleagues assumed reaction-diffusion mechanisms to stimulate the origin of pattern formation in atomic wires, leading to the manifestation of stripe patterns via Turing instability. The feature contributed to the spontaneous emergence of spatially periodic patterns.The nanowires and junctions dramatically increased the integration of electronic circuits, to provide a physical playground to explore the phenomenon of atomic-scale-based, non-equilibrium self-organization suited for exotic electronic states and for quantum advances.

  "text": "A recent study published in Nano Letters has introduced a new method for delivering particles into stem cells, which are notoriously difficult to penetrate. The discovery will make it easier to direct and enhance the processes involved in regenerative medicine.          Regenerative medicine takes advantage of the fact that our body's stem cells can change into many other cell types that are vital for the regeneration of tissue and organs, such as heart or nerve cells.Each type of cell has specialized properties and functions, so harnessing the potential of stem cell development means that regenerative medicine offers some of the most promising treatments for many diseases.To control the type of cell the stem cells change into, scientists need to reprogram the cells' genes by inserting genetic information into the stem cell's nucleus, as an operator would adjust railway tracks to change the direction of a train.However, stem cells have robust protection to stop anything from getting in, similar to our skin, so manipulating the differentiation of stem cells has been problematic.The researchers have been working to overcome this using rat stem cells and have created a way to bypass the cells' protective barrier.Dr. Gang Ruan, from Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU), China, and a corresponding author, says, \"Our new method means we can deliver genetic information to the stem cells more quickly and efficiently and control the kind of cell they become.\"Dr. Xiaowei Wen, also from XJTLU and a corresponding author, adds, \"Being able to control cell differentiation with this new method means we can improve the efficiency of stem cell therapy as we can better control what the cells transform into. This means fewer cells will be wasted, and we will need fewer cells overall to help regenerate or repair damaged tissue and organs.\"This, in turn, brings down the cost and increases the quality of the patient's life as stem cells can be used rather than donor organs which have a limited supply.\"Scaffolding solutionsDr. Wen explains why the new technology is needed to take advantage of the unique properties of stem cells.\"As we age, the number of stem cells in our body decreases dramatically. So, to harness their potential to regenerate damaged cell tissue and organs, we need to implant them into the body.\"Unfortunately, the introduced stem cells usually die within about a week once they are in the body, yet can take around four weeks to differentiate into other cell types.\"So, in our lab, we grow stem cells outside the body. Then using our new method, we can insert specific genetic information into the cells using nanoparticles to cause them to change into a particular type of cell.\"Once the cells have differentiated into the target cell type, we put them into the area of the body where there is damaged tissue so that they can help to restore it.\"In a previous study, the team identified the bottleneck in the process of delivery of nanoparticles to stem cells. They showed that the nanoparticles got trapped in bubble-like vesicles that prevented them from getting into the stem cell, but it wasn't clear why.                Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were less damaged after sonication than other cell types (top), measured by flow cytometry. BMSCs also had more cholesterol in their cell membranes (bottom). This could be why it is more difficult to penetrate stem cells. Credit: Gang Ruan (XJTLU)             Breached barriersTo understand how to overcome the difficulties posed by the stem cell barrier, the team of researchers studied ways to improve the movement of nanoparticles across the cell membranes, which could carry genetic information that would direct the transformation of a stem cell to its new cell type.\"We tried many methods that have worked in other cell types, and we found that most of these failed miserably, even ones we had high hopes for,\" Dr. Ruan says.\"Eventually, we found that coating the nanoparticles in a type of polymer helped them to get into the stem cells.\"The coated nanoparticles avoided getting trapped in vesicles, unlike the uncoated ones. In fact, they seemed to circumvent the vesicles altogether and enter the cell more directly.\"It actually wasn't a method we expected to be successful.\"It's not yet clear why the coating works, but the discovery will help to make the delivery of genetic information to stem cells more efficient so that it is easier to control which cells they become.However, the team recognizes there is a long way to go before this method can be used clinically.Dr. Ruan says, \"Not only do we need to further optimize delivery into the cells, but we also need to precisely control when it happens.\"\"But it's a big step in the right direction.\"Discovering through destructionAlthough the discovery that it was easier for coated nanoparticles to pass into stem cells has helped to solve the delivery problem, the fundamental question of why stem cells are so difficult to enter remains.The team, therefore, looked at the barrier surrounding the stem cells, the cell membrane, to see which characteristics gave them such unique properties.They took stem cell samples from six rats and used a device called a sonicator, like a mini pneumatic drill, to break up the cells, then measured the amount of damage.They found that stem cell membranes were more difficult to break when compared to other cell types that are easier to transfer genetic information into.\"Stem cell membranes seemed more robust than other cell types when sonicated. The preliminary results of the study also show that the stem cells contain more cholesterol in their cell membranes,\" says Dr. Ruan.\"This extra cholesterol makes the membrane more rigid, similar to the problems caused by cholesterol in our blood vessels. This may be why it is so difficult for nanoparticles to pass through the membrane of stem cells, though much more research is required to confirm this.\"Although the results are preliminary, this understanding of stem cell properties will further aid the development of stem cell delivery using coated nanoparticles and the optimization of future regenerative therapies.

  "text": "It's a big step forward in using extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a diagnostic tool. Lead study author, J. Nathaniel Diehl, Ph.D., at the UNC School of Medicine, led research showing how a new protocol in handling extracellular vesicles can improve significant diagnostic and therapeutic potential in disease development.          Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are fragments of cells that break off and circulate through the body. The importance of their role in the body has come into clearer focus in the last few years, whereas previously researchers had no idea if these vesicles had any real function or if they were just \"cellular debris.\" It is now known that EVs exert their biological functions by delivering proteins, metabolites, and nucleic acids to recipient cells. They also play important roles in disease development, such as pancreatic cancer, multiple myeloma, or possibly Marfan syndrome\u2014an inherited disorder that affects connective tissue.One study published in PLOS ONE titled, \"A Standardized Method For Plasma Extracellular Vesicle Isolation and Size Distribution Analysis,\" led by first author, J. Nathaniel Diehl, Ph.D., a fourth-year medical student at the UNC School of Medicine, described the workflow for isolation and quantification of plasma EVs\u2014a protocol to help labs in the field measure the quantity and size of EVs in the blood stream of patients.\"Our hope is that the protocol will allow our lab or others to build on this work to help identify patients who may need treatment without other invasive or expensive tests,\" Diehl said. \"Rather, they could have a small sample of their blood drawn, and the lab could test their blood for EVs. This technology is a long way from being available in the hospital or clinic. However, this protocol is a stepping stone for that technology,\" he said.As a sample of the diagnostic potential, Diehl and his team of researchers focused on patients with Marfan syndrome with aortic aneurysms and showed that these patients have circulating EVs that are smaller and more abundant than healthy patients.Results were also highly consistent across technical replicates (one person running the same sample multiple times) and across different personnel (two different people running the same sample). Diehl said these results gave them substantially more confidence in this new protocol's technique and its potential applications.      \"This work is a big step forward for using EVs as a possible diagnostic tool in the clinic,\" said Diehl. \"Our team defined and streamlined a technique that can be used to answer any number of clinical questions involving circulating EVs.\"As a member of the under Adam W. Akerman, Ph.D. and John S. Ikonomidis, MD, Ph.D., at the UNC School of Medicine, Diehl and his team's goal is to understand the underlying biology and pathology that leads to progression of aortic aneurysms, with a focus on patients with connective tissue disorders like Marfan syndrome. Their hope is to leverage this understanding to define methods for earlier diagnosis and possible treatments that may treat or prevent progression of aortic aneurysms.\"This work is a launching point for studying EVs and their role in this disease process,\" said Diehl. \"It's an important step towards possibly developing a blood-based test for aortic aneurysm diagnosis or monitoring. While this field is still new and there is more work to be done, we could potentially see applications of this technique as a method of monitoring patients with known aneurysms in order to avoid expensive imaging.\"Diehl said that existing imaging techniques, like CT scans, provide substantial information about blood vessels and anatomic structures critical for diagnosing aneurysms. However, they also have downsides including radiation exposure, particularly when a patient requires routine tracking of the aneurysm. With this novel protocol, researchers are now able to outline a procedure starting from a blood draw all the way through analysis of the data. Diehl said currently available literature did not have any protocols or techniques that outlined best practices to this extent.\"It remains to be seen whether EVs contribute directly to the progression of aortic aneurysms,\" said Diehl. \"At a minimum, our work demonstrates that EVs circulate in the blood stream at a higher concentration and are smaller in patients with Marfan syndrome with aortic aneurysms. Future work from our lab and others will hopefully define the specific roles of signaling proteins and nucleic acids contained within EVs.\" More information:J.

  "text": "A research team led by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory used powerful X-ray beams to unlock a new understanding of materials important to the production and use of hydrogen. The goal is to make hydrogen production and usage more efficient and less expensive, offering a better fuel for transportation and industry.          \"Efficient hydrogen production is key,\" said Hoydoo You, an Argonne senior physicist. \"Hydrogen is the lightest energy storage material. Hydrogen can be produced from water using renewable energy or excess energy, transported as a fuel, and converted back to water to produce energy for consumers. Platinum and its alloys are best in catalyzing and boosting the water-splitting process by accelerating the exchange of electrons.\"Understanding and developing materials enabling efficient production and usage of hydrogen are key to the hydrogen economy. The researchers made a first step in developing a tool that enables them to characterize the materials with a new level of detail, ultimately producing the best materials for hydrogen production and use.\"This will make production and use of hydrogen less costly and more environmentally friendly,\" You said.The research team made use of the Advanced Photon Source (APS), a DOE Office of Science user facility at Argonne. Working at the APS, researchers aimed an intense X-ray beam onto a single grain of platinum. Diffraction patterns from that grain were collected on an X-ray detector. Those patterns were converted into images of the sample using customized computer algorithms.A nanodroplet chemical cell, created with a tiny pipette tip (a tool for making a small droplet of liquid), was used to control the chemical reaction happening on the platinum grain to produce hydrogen in an electrolyzer. An electrolyzer is a device for producing hydrogen fuel from water using electricity; the device in a reverse operation, known as a fuel cell, converts hydrogen fuel back to electricity.                Graphical abstract. Credit: Nano Letters (2022). DOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c01015             \"The reaction was controlled by applying voltage, directed through an electrolyte in the nano-pipette onto the grain being studied,\" said Argonne physicist Matt Highland. He designed the initial prototype of this new tool. This prototype enabled the investigation of a single nanograin and opened a door for scanning capability over all grains in a realistic electrolyzer or fuel cell when the APS upgrade is completed. He also helped with the data collection and experiments.      Argonne physicists Ross Harder and Wonsuk Cha worked at the APS beamline 34-ID-C, where the experiments were performed, and helped with integrating the new electrochemistry tool in the existing instrument.\"The ability to do localized electrochemistry while creating a new picture of the way things were happening, at a single particle level, was incredible,\" Harder said.The APS currently delivers X-ray beams that are up to a billion times brighter than those used by a dentist. But an extensive upgrade will make the APS even more powerful. When the upgraded APS comes online in 2024, its X-ray beams will be up to 500 times brighter than today. This means that techniques like the one used in this research will get even better after the upgrade.\"The APS upgrade will help us see things happen in real time in the material,\" said Harder. \"Measurement times could become fast enough that we can move from one particle to another, and we could see how they are interacting with the electrochemical environment and each other.\"\"Important processes like battery charging and corrosion require the real-time imaging of grains to understand a full picture of the process,\" said Argonne assistant physicist Dina Sheyfer. \"We believe the added brightness of the APS upgrade with our new tool will enable studies we can only dream about today.\"The work is published in the journal Nano Letters.

  "text": "University of Minnesota Twin Cities researchers have developed a new diagnostic technique that will allow for faster and more accurate detection of neurodegenerative diseases. The method will likely open a door for earlier treatment and mitigation of various diseases that affect humans, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and similar diseases that affect animals, such as chronic wasting disease (CWD).          Their new study is published in Nano Letters.\"This paper mainly focuses on chronic wasting disease in deer, but ultimately our goal is to expand the technology for a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's being the two main targets,\" said Sang-Hyun Oh, senior co-author of the paper and a Distinguished McKnight University Professor in the University of Minnesota Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.\"Our vision is to develop ultra-sensitive, powerful diagnostic techniques for a variety of neurodegenerative diseases so that we can detect biomarkers early on, perhaps allowing more time for the deployment of therapeutic agents that can slow down the disease progression. We want to help improve the lives of millions of people affected by neurodegenerative diseases.\"Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, mad cow disease and CWD (widely found in deer) share a common feature\u2014the buildup of misfolded proteins in the central nervous system. Detecting these misfolded proteins is crucial for understanding and diagnosing these devastating disorders. However, existing diagnostic methods, like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry, can be expensive, time-consuming, and limiting in terms of antibody specificity.The University of Minnesota researchers' method, dubbed Nano-QuIC (Nanoparticle-enhanced Quaking-Induced Conversion), significantly improves the performance of advanced protein-misfolding detection methods, such as the NIH Rocky Mountain Laboratories' Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC) assay.The RT-QuIC method involves shaking a mixture of normal proteins with a small amount of misfolded protein, triggering a chain reaction that causes the proteins to multiply and allowing for the detection of these irregular proteins. Using tissue samples from deer, the University of Minnesota team demonstrated that adding 50-nanometer silica nanoparticles to RT-QuIC experiments dramatically reduces detection times from about 14 hours to only four hours and increases the sensitivity by a factor of 10.A typical 14-hour detection cycle means that a lab technician can run only one test per normal working day. However, with a detection time of less than four hours, researchers can now run three or even four tests per day.Having a quicker and highly accurate detection method is particularly important for understanding and controlling transmission of CWD, a disease that is spreading in deer across North America, Scandinavia, and South Korea. The researchers believe that Nano-QuIC could eventually prove useful for detecting protein-misfolding diseases in humans, specifically Parkinson's, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, Alzheimer's, and ALS.\"Testing for these neurodegenerative diseases in both animals and humans has been a major challenge to our society,\" said Peter Larsen, senior co-author of the paper and an assistant professor in the University of Minnesota Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences.\"What we're seeing now is this really exciting time when new, next generation diagnostic tests are emerging for these diseases. The impact that our research has is that it's greatly improving upon those next generation tests, it's making them more sensitive, and it's making them more accessible.\" More information:Peter R.

  "text": "Researchers at Columbia Engineering have developed a new class of integrated photonic devices\u2014\"leaky-wave metasurfaces\"\u2014that can convert light initially confined in an optical waveguide to an arbitrary optical pattern in free space. These devices are the first to demonstrate simultaneous control of all four optical degrees of freedom, namely, amplitude, phase, polarization ellipticity, and polarization orientation\u2014a world record.          Because the devices are so thin, transparent, and compatible with photonic integrated circuits (PICs), they can be used to improve optical displays, LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), optical communications, and quantum optics.\"We are excited to find an elegant solution for interfacing free-space optics and integrated photonics\u2014these two platforms have traditionally been studied by investigators from different subfields of optics and have led to commercial products addressing completely different needs,\" said Nanfang Yu, associate professor of applied physics and applied mathematics who is a leader in research on nanophotonic devices.\"Our work points to new ways to create hybrid systems that utilize the best of both worlds\u2014free-space optics for shaping the wavefront of light and integrated photonics for optical data processing\u2014to address many emerging applications such as quantum optics, optogenetics, sensor networks, inter-chip communications, and holographic displays.\"                Left: Photo of two leaky-wave metasurfaces for generating Kagome lattices.

Credit: Heqing Huang, Adam Overvig, and Nanfang Yu/Columbia Engineering             Bridging free-space optics and integrated photonicsThe key challenge of interfacing PICs and free-space optics is to transform a simple waveguide mode confined within a waveguide\u2014a thin ridge defined on a chip\u2014into a broad free-space wave with a complex wavefront, and vice versa. Yu's team tackled this challenge by building on their invention last fall of \"nonlocal metasurfaces\" and extended the devices' functionality from controlling free-space light waves to controlling guided waves.Specifically, they expanded the input waveguide mode by using a waveguide taper into a slab waveguide mode\u2014a sheet of light propagating along the chip. \"We realized that the slab waveguide mode can be decomposed into two orthogonal standing waves\u2014waves reminiscent of those produced by plucking a string,\" said Heqing Huang, a Ph.D. student in Yu's lab and co-first author of the study, published today in Nature Nanotechnology.\"Therefore, we designed a 'leaky-wave metasurface' composed of two sets of rectangular apertures that have a subwavelength offset from each other to independently control these two standing waves. The result is that each standing wave is converted into a surface emission with independent amplitude and polarization; together, the two surface emission components merge into a single free-space wave with completely controllable amplitude, phase, and polarization at each point over its wavefront.\"                Left two figures: Two holographic images produced by a leaky-wave metasurface at two different distances from the device surface. Right four figures: Four distinct holographic images produced by a single leaky-wave metasurface at two different distances from the device surface and at two orthogonal polarization states. Credit: Heqing Huang, Adam Overvig, and Nanfang Yu/Columbia Engineering             From quantum optics to optical communications to holographic 3D displaysYu's team experimentally demonstrated multiple leaky-wave metasurfaces that can convert a waveguide mode propagating along a waveguide with a cross-section on the order of one wavelength into free-space emission with a designer wavefront over an area about 300 times the wavelength at the telecom wavelength of 1.55 microns. These include:A leaky-wave metalens that produces a focal spot in free space. Such a device will be ideal for forming a low-loss, high-capacity free-space optical link between PIC chips; it will also be useful for an integrated optogenetic probe that produces focused beams to optically stimulate neurons located far away from the probe.A leaky-wave optical-lattice generator that can produce hundreds of focal spots forming a Kagome lattice pattern in free space. In general, the leaky-wave metasurface can produce complex aperiodic and three-dimensional optical lattices to trap cold atoms and molecules. This capability will enable researchers to study exotic quantum optical phenomena or conduct quantum simulations hitherto not easily attainable with other platforms, and enable them to substantially reduce the complexity, volume, and cost of atomic-array-based quantum devices. For example, the leaky-wave metasurface could be directly integrated into the vacuum chamber to simplify the optical system, making portable quantum optics applications, such as atomic clocks, a possibility.A leaky-wave vortex-beam generator that produces a beam with a corkscrew-shaped wavefront. This could lead to a free-space optical link between buildings that relies on PICs to process information carried by light, while also using light waves with shaped wavefronts for high-capacity intercommunication.A leaky-wave hologram that can displace four distinct images simultaneously: two at the device plane (at two orthogonal polarization states) and another two at a distance in the free space (also at two orthogonal polarization states). This function could be used to make lighter, more comfortable augmented reality goggles and more realistic holographic 3D displays.Yu's current demonstration is based on a simple polymer-silicon nitride materials platform at near-infrared wavelengths. His team plans next to demonstrate devices based on the more robust silicon nitride platform, which is compatible with foundry fabrication protocols and tolerant to high optical power operation. They also plan to demonstrate designs for high output efficiency and operation at visible wavelengths, which is more suitable for applications such as quantum optics and holographic displays.

Chad Mirkin, Ph.D., professor of Medicine in the Division of Hematology and Oncology, the George B. Rathmann Professor of Chemistry at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, and director of the International Institute for Nanotechnology, was senior author of the study.Colloidal crystal engineering with DNA involves modifying nanoparticles into programmable atom equivalents, or \"PAEs,\" which are used to form colloidal crystals that can then be used for designing programmable, synthetic DNA sequences.Most recently, this process has focused on controlling crystal size and shape, however, even with established methods, it can be difficult to separate crystal formation, or nucleation, and growth.\"New crystals can nucleate throughout the process while existing ones are growing throughout the process, and so you can have some very small crystals that might form late in the process and large ones that are growing the entire time, and you end up with a really non-uniform population in terms of the sizes of the crystals. So, trying to separate those two events, the growth from initial crystal formation, was the problem that we wanted to address,\" said Kaitlin Landy, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Chemistry in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and co-lead author of the study.In the study, Mirkin's team explored how DNA interaction strength can be used to separate nucleation and growth in colloidal crystallization.To do this, the team created two groups of complementary nanoparticles: one batch containing complementary base pairs, called \"seed\" PAEs, and the other containing mismatched base pairs to make \"growth\" PAEs.\"So you have your initial crystals ['seed' particles] that are forming a solution, and then at a later time your weaker ones ['growth' particles] are able to grow on top of what's already there,\" said Kyle Gibson, a postdoctoral fellow in the Mirkin laboratory and a co-lead author of the study.Using this method, the investigators were able to improve crystal uniformity. They could also independently select the nanoparticle and the DNA shell sequence and essentially mix and match them, allowing them to incorporate different types of materials into the crystals.\"One thing that we think is really powerful moving forward is thinking about how we can track these [crystallization] processes by using different particle cores,\" Gibson added.\"This method can be used to make these interesting core-shell structures in a single step, which previously required multiple steps with post-synthetic stabilization of the first crystal before the second growth step,\" Landy said. \"With these two different DNA interaction strengths, if we can essentially label where the different types of particles are going in the final structure, it's useful to investigate those fundamental questions.\" More information:Kaitlin M.

However, the functional failure of such materials in wet or liquid environments inevitably impairs their development in biomedicine, membrane separation, environmental monitoring, and wearable devices.       Now, a research group led by Prof. Qing Guangyan from the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics (DICP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences reported a sustainable, insoluble, and chiral photonic cellulose nanocrystal patch for calcium ion (Ca2+) sensing in sweat.The study, published in Small on April 13, provides a new idea for the functionalization of CNC.The researchers developed a simple and efficient method to fabricate insoluble CNC-based hydrogels. They found that by utilizing intermolecular hydrogen bond reconstruction, thermal dehydration enabled the optimized CNC composite photonic film to form a stable hydrogel network in an aqueous solution. Moreover, they indicated that the hydrogel could be reversibly switched between dry and wet states, which was convenient for specific functionalization.The introduction of functionalized molecules by adsorption swelling in a liquid environment resulted in a hydrogel with freeze resistance (\u201320\u00b0C), strong adhesion, good biocompatibility, and high sensitivity to Ca2+.\"This work is expected to facilitate the application of sustainable cellulose sensors to monitor other metabolites (i.e., glucose, urea, and vitamins, etc.),\" said Prof. Qing. \"It also lays the foundation for digitally controlled hydrogel systems operating in environment monitoring, membrane separation, and wearable devices.\" More information:Qiongya Li et al, Sustainable, Insoluble, and Photonic Cellulose Nanocrystal Patches for Calcium Ion Sensing in Sweat, Small (2023).

However, advances in chemical science and associated technology have equipped scientists across the world to build strainers that can separate molecules as small as hydrogen (~2*10-10 m).In a recent study published in Nature Communications, Tanmoy Maity, Pratibha Malik, Ritesh Haldar and colleagues from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Hyderabad (TIFRH), present a clearer picture of the movement of molecules through a strainer wherein the size of the pores can be reduced to \u00c5ngstrom (10-10 m) scale. The findings of this study opens up avenues for designing more efficient filtration processes frequently used in industries.Molecular strainers are used in plastic, fuel and pharmaceutical industries to separate and purify small molecules, a step essential for manufacture of many products. At the molecular level, sieving is not as straightforward as filtering of tea leaves. Things get a bit more complicated as molecules interact with the material of the sieve, and the nature of this interaction becomes difficult to predict.Further, the direction of the motion of molecules through the few \u00c5ngstrom (10-10 m) small sieves is very challenging to predict and visualize. A clearer understanding of such molecular motion would allow scientists to engineer molecular filters that can produce pure chemicals at a much lower cost than current methods.Haldar and colleagues look at one particular molecular strainer, known as metal-organic framework (MOF) wherein size of the sieve can be tuned from 1-100 \u00c5ngstrom (10-10 m) scale, so that a specific molecule can be separated from a mixture based on its size. They have synthesized a thin film (~ 300 nm thickness) of this material, so that it can act as a filter. It was known that in presence of a gradient across the filter, molecules will move from a region where there is a higher concentration of molecules to a region of lower concentration.The experimental observations from this TIFRH study indicate that as the concentration gradient becomes smaller, molecules move in a direction where space is available, even though that direction is orthogonal to the gradient.The results of the study provides a new basis for designing filters with such small pore sizes, and opens up avenues for further explorations into their utilization for separating gases and ions.

  "text": "A multi-institutional team exploring the physics of collective behavior has developed and measured a model nanomagnetic array in which the behavior can be best understood as that of a set of wiggling strings. The strings, which are composed of connected points of high energy among the lattice, can stretch and shrink, but also reconnect. What makes these strings special is that they are limited to certain endpoints and must connect to those endpoints in particular ways.          These constraints on the strings' behavior are an example of what physicists call topological behavior, which is related to a wide range of topics from the shape of a donut to how electrons travel through certain cutting-edge semiconductors.\"Topological physics has raised much recent interest, mostly in the quantum domain,\" said Cristiano Nisoli, a Los Alamos National Laboratory researcher and co-author of the work published in Science. \"We had already demonstrated a few times, theoretically and experimentally, that features once believed to be inherently quantum can be reproduced by systems of classical interacting nanomagnets.\"According to co-author Peter Schiffer, a Yale applied physics professor, \"This system is an instance in which topologically driven features appear in a purely classical material system\u2014that makes them easier to study and characterize.\"Santa Fe spin ice inspired by New Mexico brick floorThe work is in the context of an ongoing collaboration between Nisoli's group in the Los Alamos Theoretical division and the experimental work of Schiffer and his team at Yale University. Starting in 2006, together with others, the two had introduced the idea of bottom-up fabrication of \"artificial spin ice\" structures made of interacting magnetic nano-islands. The team for this study also included Yale researchers Xiaoyu Zhang, Grant Fitez, Shayaan Subzwari, Ioan-Augustin Chioar, Hilal Saglam and Nicholas Bingham (now at the University of Maine), as well as Justin Ramberger and Chris Leighton at the University of Minnesota.\"Initially, we concentrated on simple geometries and models, sometimes mimicking existing natural materials,\" Nisoli said. \"But since the beginning, the idea was more ambitious: instead of finding serendipitously exotic or useful phenomena in natural materials, we sought to produce artificial ones where new phenomena could be designed in, and checked in highly controllable ways, perhaps in view of future functionalities, such as memory storage or computation.\"The teams developed\u2014first theoretically at Los Alamos, and then experimentally at Yale and the Advanced Light Source facility at Berkeley National Laboratory\u2014a geometry called Santa Fe spin ice, inspired by the shapes in a brick floor in Santa Fe, New Mexico. \"The interesting fact about Santa Fe spin ice is that although it is made of a bunch of binary magnets, it can also be completely described as a set of continuous strings,\" Nisoli noted.In a previous work, the authors fabricated the Santa Fe spin ice and demonstrated the existence of these strings and their properties. In the present work, they studied how the strings move. Using the photoemission electron microscopy characterization done at Berkeley was especially valuable in that \"it effectively provides video clips of the nanomagnets in space and in time, so we could watch them as they spontaneously switched their north and south poles,\" said Schiffer of Yale. \"The nano-islands are fabricated to be very thin, just a few nanometers, so that they flip their poles just from being at finite temperature, in a well-known phenomenon called superparamagnetism.\"At high temperatures, the researchers observed the merging and reconnecting of strings, resulting in the system transitioning between topologically distinct configurations. But below a crossover temperature, the string motion was limited to simple changes in length and shape. Therefore, the work shows that there is a dynamic crossover: below a certain temperature those topologically non-trivial moves become suppressed, and only the topologically trivial (wiggling, extending and contracting) remain.      Kinetic crossover breaks rules\"Here, we have shown a real system, artificially fabricated, that experimentally demonstrates a kinetic crossover that breaks the rule of randomness, or ergodicity, because below a certain temperature it suppresses the kinetic pathways that are topologically non-trivial, and remains confined into a topological class,\" Nisoli said. \"With the measurements we could perform, we were able to literally watch these nanoscale strings go through their motions and make an unexpected transition in behavior.\"\"This level of insight is unusual for any system, and it sets the stage for other topological studies in the future,\" said Schiffer.

Despite their small size, nanomagnets\u2014found in most spintronic applications\u2014reveal rich dynamics of spin excitations, or \"magnons,\" the quantum-mechanical units of spin fluctuations. Due to its nanoscale confinement, a nanomagnet can be considered to be a zero-dimensional system with a discrete magnon spectrum, similar to the spectrum of an atom.\"The magnons interact with each other, thus constituting nonlinear spin dynamics,\" said Igor Barsukov, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at UC Riverside and a corresponding author on the study that appears in the journal Physical Review Applied. \"Nonlinear spin dynamics is a major challenge and a major opportunity for improving the performance of spintronic technologies such as spin-torque memory, oscillators, and neuromorphic computing.\"Barsukov explained that the interaction of magnons follows a set of rules\u2014the selection rules. The researchers have now postulated these rules in terms of symmetries of magnetization configurations and magnon profiles.The new work continues the efforts to tame nanomagnets for next-generation computation technologies. In a previous publication, the team demonstrated experimentally that symmetries can be used for engineering magnon interactions.\"We recognized the opportunity, but also noticed that much work needed to be done to understand and formulate the selection rules,\" Barsukov said.According to the researchers, a comprehensive set of rules reveals the mechanisms behind the magnon interaction.\"It can be seen as a guide for spintronics labs for debugging and designing nanomagnet devices,\" said Arezoo Etesamirad, the first author of the paper who worked in the Barsukov lab and recently graduated with a doctoral degree in physics. \"It lays the foundation for developing an experimental toolset for tunable magnetic neurons, switchable oscillators, energy-efficient memory, and quantum-magnonic and other next-generation nanomagnetic applications.\"Barsukov and Etesamirad were joined in the research by Rodolfo Rodriguez of UCR; and Julia Kharlan and Roman Verba of the Institute of Magnetism in Kyiv, Ukraine.

  "text": "An international team of scientists has imaged and analyzed THz waves that propagate in the form of plasmon polaritons along thin anisotropic semiconductor platelets with wavelengths reduced by up to 65 times compared to THz waves in free space.          What's even more intriguing is that the wavelengths vary with the direction of propagation. Such THz waves can be applied for probing fundamental material properties at the nanometer scale and pave the way to the development of ultra-compact on-chip THz devices. The work has been published in Nature Materials.Polaritons are hybrid states of light and matter that arise from the coupling of light with matter excitations. Plasmon and phonon polaritons are among the most prominent examples, formed by the coupling of light to collective electron oscillations and crystal lattice vibrations, respectively.They play a crucial role in various applications, from sub-diffraction optical spectroscopy and ultrasensitive chemical sensors to ultracompact modulators for communication applications. In thin layers, polaritons can propagate with wavelengths up to 100 times shorter than the corresponding photon wavelength, allowing for manipulation of light on a much smaller scale than previously possible with conventional photonic devices.While most of these ultra-confined polaritons have been observed in form of phonon polaritons in the mid-infrared spectral range, the researchers focused on plasmon polaritons, as these can exist in much broader spectral ranges. \"On the other hand, plasmon polaritons often suffer from large damping, resulting in short propagation lengths. This has been challenging the observation of ultra-confined plasmon polaritons in real space,\" says Shu Chen, first author of the publication.Using a THz nanoscope (more precisely, a THz scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope, s-SNOM) in Rainer Hillenbrand\u00b4s lab at CIC nanoGUNE (San Sebastian, Spain), Chen studied thin platelets of the low-symmetry crystal silver telluride (Ag2Te; hessite) and obtained the first real-space images of THz plasmon polaritons, whose wavelengths are up to 65 times reduced compared to the photon wavelength and vary with the propagation direction.\"Silver telluride is a narrow bandgap semiconductor with a relatively high mobile electron concentration, which makes this material plasmonic at THz frequencies,\" says Pengliang Leng, equally contributing first author, who fabricated the platelets in Faxian Xiu\u00b4s lab at Fudan University (Shanghai, China). \"Because of the low-symmetry monoclinic crystal structure, the effective electron mass is strongly anisotropic along the platelet surface, which explains the anisotropic plasmon polariton propagation,\" adds Faxian Xiu.The researchers also demonstrated that the relative propagation lengths of the THz polaritons can be significantly increased by coupling them with their mirror image in an adjacent metal substrate. \"Because of this coupling, so-called acoustic plasmon polaritons are formed,\" explains Andrea Kone\u010dn\u00e1 from Brno University (Czech Republic), who theoretically modeled the acoustic polaritons.\"Most important, the anisotropy of the polariton propagation is qualitatively preserved, and the long relative propagation lengths allowed us to unambiguously verify that the polaritons propagate with elliptical wavefronts,\" adds Rainer Hillenbrand from nanoGUNE, who led the work.The long relative propagation lengths of the elliptical acoustic plasmon polaritons finally allowed the researchers to determine the in-plane anisotropic effective electron mass, establishing a unique method for the nanoscale measurement of directional effective carrier masses at room temperature.Beyond exploring fundamental materials properties in conventional and novel quantum materials, ultra-confined in-plane anisotropic acoustic plasmon polaritons may lead to ultra-compact on-chip THz applications. The strong field concentration in the gap between the polaritonic layer and metal surface may be exploited for field-enhanced molecular sensing or for boosting (ultra)strong THz light\u2013matter coupling with molecules, classical 2D electron gases or quantum materials.

  "text": "Storing data in DNA sounds like science fiction, yet it lies in the near future. Professor Tom de Greef expects the first DNA data center to be up and running within five to ten years. Data won't be stored as zeros and ones in a hard drive but in the base pairs that make up DNA: AT and CG. Such a data center would take the form of a lab, many times smaller than the ones today.          De Greef can already picture it all. In one part of the building, new files will be encoded via DNA synthesis. Another part will contain large fields of capsules, each capsule packed with a file. A robotic arm will remove a capsule, read its contents and place it back.We're talking about synthetic DNA. In the lab, bases are stuck together in a certain order to form synthetically produced strands of DNA. Files and photos that are currently stored in data centers can then be stored in DNA. For now, the technique is suitable only for archival storage. This is because the reading of stored data is very expensive, so you want to consult the DNA files as little as possible.Large, energy-guzzling data centers made obsoleteData storage in DNA offers many advantages. A DNA file can be stored much more compactly, for instance, and the lifespan of the data is also many times longer. But perhaps most importantly, this new technology renders large, energy-guzzling data centers obsolete. And this is desperately needed, warns De Greef, \"because in three years, we will generate so much data worldwide that we won't be able to store half of it.\"Together with Ph.D. student Bas B\u00f6gels, Microsoft and a group of university partners, De Greef has developed a new technique to make the innovation of data storage with synthetic DNA scalable. The results have been published today in the journal Nature Nanotechnology. De Greef works at the Department of Biomedical Engineering and the Institute for Complex Molecular Systems (ICMS) at TU Eindhoven and serves as a visiting professor at Radboud University.ScalableThe idea of using strands of DNA for data storage emerged in the 1980s but was far too difficult and expensive at the time. It became technically possible three decades later, when DNA synthesis started to take off. George Church, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School, elaborated on the idea in 2011. Since then, synthesis and the reading of data have become exponentially cheaper, finally bringing the technology to the market.In recent years, De Greef and his group have looked mainly into reading the stored data. For the time being, this is the biggest problem facing this new technique. The PCR method currently used for this, called 'random access', is highly error-prone. You can therefore only read one file at a time and, in addition, the data quality deteriorates too much each time you read a file. Not exactly scalable.Here's how it works: PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) creates millions of copies of the piece of DNA that you need by adding a primer with the desired DNA code. Corona tests in the lab, for example, are based on this: even a minuscule amount of coronavirus material from your nose is detectable when copied so many times. But if you want to read multiple files simultaneously, you need multiple primer pairs doing their work at the same time. This creates many errors in the copying process.      Every capsule contains one fileThis is where the capsules come into play. De Greef's group developed a microcapsule of proteins and a polymer and then anchored one file per capsule. De Greef says, \"These capsules have thermal properties that we can use to our advantage.\" Above 50 degrees Celsius, the capsules seal themselves, allowing the PCR process to take place separately in each capsule. Not much room for error then. De Greef calls this 'thermo-confined PCR'. In the lab, it has so far managed to read 25 files simultaneously without significant error.If you then lower the temperature again, the copies detach from the capsule and the anchored original remains, meaning that the quality of your original file does not deteriorate. \"We currently stand at a loss of 0.3 percent after three reads, compared to 35 percent with the existing method,\" says De Greef.Searchable with fluorescenceAnd that's not all. De Greef has also made the data library even easier to search. Each file is given a fluorescent label and each capsule its own color. A device can then recognize the colors and separate them from one another. This brings us back to the imaginary robotic arm at the beginning of this story, which will neatly select the desired file from the pool of capsules in the future.This solves the problem of reading the data. De Greef says, \"Now it's just a matter of waiting until the costs of DNA synthesis fall further. The technique will then be ready for application.\" As a result, he hopes that the Netherlands will soon be able to open its inaugural DNA data center\u2014a world first.

Most recently, she was awarded a dissertation completion fellowship through MSU's College of Engineering. Hill's research with Prussian blue nanoparticles will improve cancer research.       What is a nanoparticle?A nanoparticle represents a particle that ranges in size between one and 100 nanometers. Nanoparticles can be composed of many different elements and can be made into many different shapes for various applications in medicine, the environment and chemistry.                Prussian blue nanoparticle squares covered in exomes or cells so that the particles can cross the blood brain barrier. Credit: Meghan Hill             How do you use nanoparticles in your research?Most nanoparticles can't pass through the blood-brain barrier\u2014the network of blood vessels that protects the brain. To bypass this, we use Prussian blue nanoparticles. Prussian blue pigment was created in the 1700s when someone combined rocks and blood together to create a red paint but ended up with blue instead. Because of its cubic structure and high iron content, Prussian blue is used in various medical applications. For example, the position of the iron atoms in Prussian blue can enhance MRI contrast.For our research, we use exosome or cell-coated Prussian blue nanoparticles that can cross the blood-brain barrier and specifically target tumor cells. Once the particles are near the tumor region, they can allow for early detection and localized treatment using heat. We use a photothermal treatment that uses laser light to illuminate the particles, which creates localized heat that kills cancer cells. This treatment also doesn't cause those nasty side effects we often see with chemotherapy treatment.What is the goal of your research?The goal of the research is to deliver nanoparticles that can have both diagnostic and therapeutic effect on brain tumors. This could have a really big impact on the medical industry because this work could be applied to many different types of cancers in the future.We would like to improve the quality of life for patients that are diagnosed with brain cancer. The current five-year survival rate is less than 7%, and we want to increase that. Hopefully, we will be able to diagnose brain cancer at an earlier stage.I am really hoping to find a way to apply nanotechnology to the medical industry by finding different ways to utilize common types of particles or drugs whose abilities aren't commonly investigated.

The Nottingham Trent University team says the work\u2014the first of its kind\u2014enables them to see how a protein behaves in its natural environment and that it could help better understand proteins linked to disease and how they might respond to certain therapies.The research involves using a very high concentration of light which, when the beam is transmitted through a specifically engineered nano structure, generates the right amount of force to grasp and hold a single protein within the fluid without damaging it.The technology is able to detect how the light is scattered and the researchers can analyze this unique data to reveal how the protein is behaving in real-time.The protein is studied in its natural liquid environment, as the team's technique can mimic the body by altering factors such as salt concentration, pH, or oxygen levels.As a proof of concept the researchers studied ferritin, a protein in the blood which stores and releases iron to prevent diseases associated with iron dysregulation, such as anemia.During the study they were able to distinguish between the ferritin with iron and without\u2014as the data revealed differences in their weight and movement\u2014and even the point at which the ferritin without iron began capturing and storing iron.They say that the study has deepened understanding of the iron uptake mechanism of ferritin proteins, which could lead to new therapeutics for iron-related diseases.Until now, studies of ferritin have only been able to use ensemble measurements to quantify the characteristics of a large number of proteins, which provides limited information about their structural changes.The researchers argue that because protein changes occur before symptoms in illness, their work could make it possible to identify and treat a range of diseases much earlier.\"To be able to see things beyond your eyesight, you first need the right technology. Our nanostructure enables us to observe proteins at the nano-scale,\" said lead researcher Dr. Cuifeng Ying from Nottingham Trent University's School of Science and Technology.

We can look at lots of proteins and see how they react to different drugs. In the future this breakthrough could play a key role in improving survival rates and reducing healthcare costs.\"There has previously been no tool to enable us to study proteins in this way without destroying them.The study, which also involved the University of Nottingham and the Adolphe Merkle Institute at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, is published in the journal Nano Letters.

Hydrogels functionalized with electrically conductive components can be used in bioelectronic devices for cardiac or neural interfaces, for applications such as neural prosthetics, cardiac patches and electronic skin.          A research team led by Dr. Lizhi Xu of the Department of Mechanical Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) has recently developed a new type of electroconductive hydrogel with outstanding mechanical strength and manufacturability, creating opportunities for the engineering of various bioelectronic devices.The innovation has been published in Nature Communications in an article entitled \"Hybrid assembly of polymeric nanofiber network for robust and electronically conductive hydrogels.\"Synthetic hydrogels are water-rich polymeric materials resembling biological soft tissues. They are soft, porous, and biocompatible, enabling a physical interface between natural biological tissues and advanced biomedical tools. In particular, electroconductive hydrogels have attracted wide research attention, as they can be used in bioelectronic devices for cardiac or neural interfaces.\"Existing hydrogels are mechanically weak and difficult to manufacture, which limits their practical utility. We used a unique microscale scaffold for the synthesis of conductive hydrogels. The architecture of the composites provided a combination of properties inaccessible by other hydrogels, which is crucial for realistic applications in bioelectronic devices,\" said Dr. Xu.For the new hydrogels developed by Dr. Xu's team, a 3D nanofiber network was utilized as a template to guide the assembly of conducting polymers (such as polypyrrole). The high connectivity of the nanofibers provided both structural robustness and an effective pathway for electron conduction.\"For potential biomedical applications, the device needs to withstand repeated mechanical loading associated with body motion. In this regard, mechanical robustness of the materials would be very important,\" Dr. Xu explained.The resulting material developed by the team contains 80% water by weight, while at the same time showing a high electrical conductivity of ~80 S/cm and a mechanical strength of ~9.4 MPa.\"These conductive hydrogels are easy to fabricate. One can pattern them into arrays of electrodes, interconnects, and biosensors, enabling functional systems such as wearable health monitors or cardiac tissue engineering platforms,\" Dr. Xu said.\"It opens opportunities for many advanced medical tools down the road, such as neural prosthetics, cardiac patches, electronic skin, and so on,\" He added.Dr. Xu and his research team earlier created another novel type of hydrogel that mimics tendons, exhibiting remarkable mechanical properties that closely resemble those of natural tendons, along with multiple functionalities that are well-suited for biomedical applications.

Wouldn't it be great?          A team of researchers led by Prof. Aitor Mugarza, from the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2) and ICREA, together with Prof. Diego Pe\u00f1a from the Center for Research in Biological Chemistry and Molecular Materials of the University of Santiago de Campostela (CiQUS-USC), Dr. Cesar Moreno, formerly a member of ICN2's team and currently a researcher at the University of Cantabria, and Dr. Aran Garcia-Lekue, from the Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC) and Ikerbasque Foundation, has done something analogous, but at the single-atom scale, with the aim of synthesizing new carbon-based materials with tunable properties.As explained in a paper just published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS) and featured on the cover of the issue, this research is a significant breakthrough in the precise engineering of atomic-thin materials \u2014called \"2D materials\" due to their reduced dimensionality. The proposed fabrication technique opens exciting new possibilities for materials science, and, in particular, for application in advanced electronics and future solutions for sustainable energy.The authors of this study synthesized a new nanoporous graphene structure by connecting ultra-narrow graphene strips, known as \"nanoribbons\", by means of flexible \"bridges\" made of phenylene moieties (which are portions of larger molecules).By modifying in a continuous way the architecture and angle of these bridges, the scientists can control the quantum connectivity between the nanoribbon channels and, ultimately, fine-tune the electronic properties of the graphene nanoarchitecture. The tunability could also be controlled by external stimuli, such as strain or electric fields, providing opportunities for different applications.These ground-breaking findings, resulting from a collaboration between top-tier Spanish institutions (CiQUS, ICN2, University of Cantabria, DIPC) and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), shows that the proposed molecular bridge strategy can have a great impact on the synthesis of new materials with tailored properties and is a powerful tool for the realization of quantum circuits.These perform operations similar to those of conventional circuits, although unlike the latter, quantum circuits leverage quantum effects and phenomena. The design and implementation of these systems are extremely relevant to the development of quantum computers.But the potential applications of the approach proposed in this study go beyond future electronic devices and computers. In fact, it could also lead to the development of thermoelectric nanomaterials, which can have an important impact in renewable energy generation and waste heat recovery, therefore addressing another crucial societal challenge.

  "text": "Several high-performance thermoelectric materials have been discovered over the past two decades, but without efficient devices to convert the energy they produce into emission-free power, their promise has been unfulfilled. Now an international team of scientists led by a University of Houston physicist and several of his former students has reported a new approach to constructing the thermoelectric modules, using silver nanoparticles to connect the modules' electrode and metallization layers.          The work, described in a paper published May 1 in Nature Energy, should accelerate the development of advanced modules for power generation and other uses. The use of silver nanoparticles was tested for stability in modules built of three different state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials, designed to operate across a wide range of temperatures.Thermoelectric materials have drawn increasing interest because of their potential as a source of clean energy, produced when the material converts heat\u2014such as waste heat generated by power plants or other industrial processes\u2014into electricity by exploiting the flow of heat current from a warmer area to a cooler area. But taking advantage of that ability requires finding a material that can connect the hot and cool sides of the material both electrically and thermally, without interfering with the material's performance.The connective material, or solder, is melted to create an interface between the two sides. That means the solder must have a higher melting point than the operating temperature of the device in order to remain stable while the device is working, said Zhifeng Ren, director of the Texas Center for Superconductivity at UH and a corresponding author on the paper. If the thermoelectric material operates at hotter temperatures, the connective layer will re-melt.But it can also be a problem if the connective material has too high a melting point, because high temperatures can affect the stability and performance of the thermoelectric materials during the connection process. The ideal connective material, then, would both have a relatively low melting point for assembling the module, so as not to destabilize the thermoelectric materials, but then be able to withstand high operating temperatures without re-melting.Silver has valuable properties for such a connective material, with high thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity. But it also has a relatively high melting point, at 962 degrees Centigrade, which can affect the stability of many thermoelectric materials. For this work, the researchers took advantage of the fact that silver nanoparticles have a much lower melting point than bulk silver. The nanoparticles returned to a bulk state after the module was assembled, regaining the higher melting point for operations.      \"If you make silver into nanoparticles, the melting point could be as low as 400 degrees or 500 degrees C, depending on the particle size. That means you can use the device at 600 C or 700 C with no problem, as long as the operating temperature remains below the melting point of bulk silver, or 962 C,\" said Ren, who is also M.D. Anderson Professor of Physics at UH.He worked on the project with five former students and post-doctoral researchers from the Ren research group; they are now at the Harbin Institute of Technology in Shenzhen, China, and the Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.The researchers tested the silver nanoparticles with three well-known thermoelectric materials, each of which operates at a different temperature.A lead tellurium-based module, which works at a low temperature of about 573 Kelvin up to about 823 K (300 C to 550 C) produced a heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency of about 11% and remained stable after 50 thermal cycles, according to the researchers.They also used the silver nanoparticles as the connective material in modules using low-temperature bismuth telluride and a half-Heusler high-temperature material, indicating the concept would work for a variety of thermoelectric materials and purposes.Different materials are used depending on the intended heat source, Ren said, to ensure the materials can withstand the applied heat. \"But this paper proves that whatever the material, we can use the same silver nanoparticles for the solder as long as the applied heat does not go above 960 degrees C,\" in order to remain below the melting point of bulk silver, he said.

  "text": "Ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer deaths among women, accounting for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. In a study conducted at Tel Aviv University, researchers used protein CKAP5 (cytoskeleton-associated protein) for the first time as a therapeutic target for RNA-based nanodrugs. After identifying a genetically unstable mutation resistant to both chemotherapy and immunotherapy in the tissues of ovarian cancer, the researchers targeted these cells with lipid nanoparticles containing RNA for silencing CKAP5\u2014causing the cells to collapse and achieving an 80% survival rate in animal models.          \"The lipid nanoparticles developed by Prof. Peer enabled us for the first time to silence [the CKAP5] protein through targeted delivery of an RNA drug. We proved that CKAP5, a protein responsible for the cell's stability, can be silenced, and that this procedure collapses and destroys the entire cancer cell,\" says Dr. Sushmita Chatterjee.Targeted delivery of RNA drugThe breakthrough was achieved by a TAU research team led by Prof. Dan Peer of The Shmunis School of Biomedicine and Cancer Research, a global pioneer in the development of RNA-based drugs, Head of the Laboratory of Precision Nanomedicine, and TAU's VP for R&D and by Dr. Sushmita Chatterjee, post-doctoral student from India at Prof. Peer's lab, in collaboration with Prof. David Sprinzak of The George S. Wise Faculty of Life Sciences and Prof. Ronen Zaidel-Bar of the Sackler Faculty of Medicine. The results were published in the journal Science Advances.\"The protein CKAP5 has never been studied with relation to the fight against cancer, simply because there was no known way to silence it,\" explains Dr. Chatterjee. \"The lipid nanoparticles developed by Prof. Peer enabled us for the first time to silence this protein through targeted delivery of an RNA drug. We proved that CKAP5, a protein responsible for the cell's stability, can be silenced, and that this procedure collapses and destroys the entire cancer cell.\"At the second stage of the study the researchers tested the new CKAP5-silencing RNA drug on 20 types of cancer. Some cancer cells proved more sensitive than others to this procedure. Cancers displaying high genetic instability, which are usually highly resistant to chemotherapy, were found to be especially sensitive to the silencing of CKAP5.\"As researchers, we are involved in something like a dominoes game: we always look for the one piece in the cancer's structure that is so important, that if we pull it out the entire cell will collapse. CKAP5 is such a domino piece, and we are already working on more applications,\" says Prof. Dan Peer.\"All cancer cells are genetically unstable,\" says Dr. Chatterjee. \"Otherwise, they would be healthy, not cancerous. However, there are different levels of genetic instability. We found that cancer cells that are more unstable, are also more affected by damage to CKAP5. Our drug pushed them to their limit, and essentially destroyed their structure. Our idea was to turn the trait of genetic instability into a threat for these cells, by using RNA to silence the flawed protein. We demonstrated for the first time that CKAP5 can be used to kill cancer cells, and then observed the biological mechanism that causes the cancer cells to collapse in the protein's absence.\"Equipped with these insights, the researchers tested the new drug in an animal model for ovarian cancer, achieving a survival rate of 80%.\"We chose ovarian cancer because it's a good target,\" explains Prof. Peer. \"While highly resistant to both chemotherapy and immunotherapy, this type of cancer is very sensitive to the silencing of CKAP5. It should be emphasized that the CKAP5 protein is a new target in the fight against cancer. Targeting cell division is not new, but using RNA to target proteins that make up the cell's skeleton (cytoskeleton)\u2014this is a new approach and a new target that must be further investigated. As researchers, we are involved in something like a dominoes game: we always look for the one piece in the cancer's structure that is so important, that if we pull it out the entire cell will collapse.

  "text": "Membrane separation technology has been widely recognized as a more advantageous technology owing to its high treatment efficiency, low footprint, reliable effluent quality. However, its further sustainable growth has been hampered due to membrane fouling. Although great efforts have been made in the recent decades to improve the antifouling performance via various modification strategies, but the obtained membranes commonly possess more complicated surface chemistry, which is unfavorable for membrane fouling control.          The polarity of molecules essentially determines their molecular interaction behavior. Nonpolar membranes may exhibit advantages in antifouling because the electric dipole moment is close to zero, which is not conducive to the deposition of pollutants on the membrane surface. However, such a fundamental interaction mechanism is rarely considered in the previous membrane fabrication and modification studies.Also, nonpolar materials have not been sufficiently concerned in previous membrane preparation studies. Although carbon nanotube had been increasingly employed for membrane fabrication, the potential beneficial effects of its nonpolar feature had been barely investigated. A few studies developed vertically aligned CNT membranes, but they are not suitable for micro-/ultra-filtration processes due to limited pore size and porosity.To address these barriers, researchers from Beijing Forestry University and Tsinghua University prepared a nonpolar super-aligned CNT (SACNT) membrane with a layer-by-layer cross-tacking strategy. Their study reveals that SACNT membrane surface chemistry is simple and inert, potentially eliminating covalent bonding induced membrane fouling.Besides, compared with the commercial membranes, the SACNT membranes obtained a significantly higher selectivity while achieving a comparable or higher permeability This study entitled \"Nonpolar cross-stacked super-aligned carbon nanotube membrane for efficient wastewater treatment\" is published online in Frontiers of Environmental Science & Engineering in 2023.In this study, the research team found that the surface chemistry of the SACNT membranes is simple and inert, thereby potentially eliminating the covalent-bonding-induced membrane fouling. Besides, the SACNT membranes exhibited a typical nonpolar wetting behavior, with high contact angles for polar liquids (water: ~124.9\u00b0\u2013126.5\u00b0; formamide: ~80.0\u00b0\u201383.9\u00b0) but low contact angles for nonpolar diiodomethane (~18.8\u00b0\u201320.9\u00b0). Their research achieved a smoother and more uniform structure with higher permeability than commercial membranes. The SACNT membrane in municipal wastewater treatment cleaning efficiency increased by 2.3 times, oil/water separation efficiency reached 99.2%.This study successfully proposed a novel nonpolar SACNT membrane by using a layer-by-layer cross-stacking method using the nonpolar carbon nanotubes as the raw material. This work not only provides a new solution to the problem of membrane pollution in membrane separation technology, but also improves the efficiency of municipal sewage treatment and waste water recovery, which has a broad application prospect in various fields.

  "text": "Recently, two-dimensional (2D) boron sheets\u2014borophenes\u2014have drawn great interest from materials scientists because of their similarity to graphene. However, understanding of how the material can be stable in the 2D form is still lacking, mainly due to boron's unique electron-deficient nature.          In chemistry, atoms in a stable material generally obey the octet rule. A carbon atom usually shares 8 electrons by forming 4 chemical bonds with its neighbors, specifically 3 \u03c3 and 1 \u03c0 bonds for carbon atoms in graphene. While a boron atom has only 3 valence electrons, its stability, or its bonding strategy to have 8 electrons, has been a long-term mystery in history.The concept of the three-center two-electron (3c-2e) bond allows us to understand how a boron atom satisfies the octet rule in boron-related small molecules, such as diborane (B2H6), and won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1976. But, how boron atoms in complicated boron materials like borophenes obey the octet rule and maintain stable, is still beyond our knowledge.Additionally, in carbon materials like benzene, bond resonance or aromaticity could further stabilize the materials by delocalizing the \u03c0 electrons, out of the plane, to a larger area. Could we extend the theory to the 2D boron sheet to explain its triangular lattice-based structure and stability?Scientists from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering at UNIST, in cooperation with researchers at Rice University, U.S., and Nankai University, China, proposed a new bonding theory, which solves the long-term mystery by illustrating both i) how each boron atom in a borophene satisfies the octet rule based on the unique 3c-2e bonds and ii) how the resonance of alternating 3c-2e \u03c3 bonds further stabilizes the 2D sheet in its triangular lattice.Interestingly, this theory, in analogy to \u03c0 resonance in carbon materials, introduces a new form of resonance, which allows the delocalization of \u03c3 electrons within the 2D plane. In combination with the out-of-plane \u03c0 resonance, the triangular boron sheet in fact exhibits a sandwich electronic structure, composing of both in-plane and out-of-plane delocalized electrons.Based on the theory, everyone can draw the bonding structures of these new boron materials, like drawing the Kekul\u00e9 structures of the benzene molecule. Therefore, stability and properties of the borophene materials can be easily understood without performing complicated quantum calculations.Major puzzles in the field, such as how hexagonal holes stabilize the triangular boron lattice, why neutral borophene with 1/9 hole ratio are energetically most favorable, and how substrate doping affects the hole concentration in borophene, are well explained for the first time. \"The theory reveals the origin of the unique properties of these flat boron materials, and therefore offers an avenue for the controlled synthesis and design of borophene by predicting their stabilities on the substrates,\" noted the first author of the study, Dr. Lu Qiu.Intuitive understanding of bonding in various molecules and materials is always the core part of chemistry. \"Our theory, for the first time, provides fundamental and necessary elements for studying flat boron materials without performing any quantum calculations,\" says the corresponding author of the study, Prof. Feng Ding, \"thus, we are confident that this \u03c3 bond resonance theory will further stimulate the community towards accelerating design and synthesis of boron related materials, like the aromaticity theory for carbon materials.\"The work is published in the journal Nature Communications.

  "text": "A research team led by Prof. Hyeon Taeghwan at the Center for Nanoparticle Research within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in Seoul, South Korea has developed a new photocatalytic platform for the mass production of hydrogen.          Published in Nature Nanotechnology, the group's study on the photocatalytic platform led to the development of a floatable photocatalytic matrix, which allows efficient hydrogen evolution reaction with clear advantages over conventional hydrogen production platforms such as film or panel types.The importance of alternative energy has recently increased due to global challenges such as environmental pollution and climate change. Among several candidates for alternative energy sources, hydrogen energy harvested by photocatalysis is of particular interest for its sustainable green energy production.Accordingly, much research and development have been made to enhance the intrinsic reaction efficiency of photocatalysts. However, research on the form factor of photocatalytic systems, which is critical for their practical application and commercialization, has not yet been actively explored.Usually, current systems fix catalyst powder or nanoparticles onto different surfaces, such as particulate sheet-type, film-type, and flat panel-type platforms, which are submerged under water. They also face practical issues such as the leaching of catalysts, poor mass transfer, and reverse reactions. They also require additional devices to separate and collect the generated hydrogen from water, which adds to the complexity of the device and increases the costs.                Floatable photocatalytic platforms have clear advantages in hydrogen evolution reaction, in terms of efficient light delivery, facile gas separation, enhanced surface tension, stable catalyst immobilization, suppressed back-oxidation (reverse reaction), and facile supply of water. Credit: Institute for Basic Science             The team at the Center for Nanoparticle Research within the IBS, led by Prof. Hyeon, designed a new type of photocatalytic platform that floats on the water for efficient hydrogen production. This new platform has a bilayer structure, which consists of an upper photocatalytic layer and a lower supporting layer.Both layers are composed of a porous structural polymer that endows high surface tension to the platform. In addition, the platform is fabricated in the form of cryo aerogel, a solid substance filled with gas inside, exhibiting low density. As a result, this elastomer-hydrogel embedded with photocatalysts can float on water.      This platform exhibits clear advantages in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction: first, light attenuation by water is prevented, resulting in efficient solar energy conversion. Second, the product, hydrogen gas, can be easily diffused into the air, avoiding reverse oxidation reactions and preserving high reaction yield. Third, the water can be easily supplied to the catalysts located inside the elastomer-hydrogel matrix due to its porosity. Last, catalysts are stably immobilized inside the matrix for long-term operation without leaching issues.The researchers experimentally proved the superior hydrogen evolution performance of the floatable platform, compared to that of the conventional submerged platform. Furthermore, the scalability of the platform, which is essential for potential industrialization, was also demonstrated under natural sunlight. It was confirmed that about 80 mL of hydrogen can be produced by the floatable photocatalytic platform using copper single atom and titania catalysts with an area of 1 m2 .                A, B.

Credit: Institute for Basic Science             Even after 2 weeks of operation in seawater containing various microorganisms and floating matter, the hydrogen evolution performance of the platform was not compromised.Prof. Kim states, \"The proposed platform can even produce hydrogen from solutions that dissolve household waste, such as polyethylene terephthalate bottles. Consequently, the platform can be a solution for recycling wastes, which contributes to an environment-friendly society.\"Notably, this study presents a generalized platform for efficient photocatalysis that is not just limited to hydrogen production. It is possible to replace the catalytic component for various desired uses, without changing the floatable aerogel material properties of the overall platform. This guarantees the wide applicability of the platform to other photocatalytic reactions, such as oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen peroxide production, and generation of various organic compounds.\"This study makes great progress in the field of photocatalysis and showcases the potential of green hydrogen production at sea with world-class performance. The distinctive material features, high performance, and broad applicability in the field of photocatalysis of our platform will undoubtedly open a new chapter in alternative energy,\" says Prof. Hyeon.

  "answer_squad": " Hall-Petch",
  "text": "Most crystalline materials are polycrystals, such as metals. They are composed of many small crystalline grains with different lattice orientations. The interface between two crystalline grains, i.e., the grain boundary, is a thin layer of disordered particles about one or two particles thick.          The polycrystal strength increases as the mean grain size decreases, known as the famous Hall-Petch behavior. This trend reverses when the mean grain diameter is below a critical value of 10\u201315 nanometers (about 50 atoms), i.e., the reverse Hall-Petch behavior. These trends hold for various polycrystals composed of different atoms and molecules.However, how the strength varies with the thickness of the disordered grain boundary has rarely been asked and poorly understood, probably because polycrystals with thick grain boundaries are not easy to fabricate and control. Although this basic question can be relatively easily explored by computer simulation, related research remains lacking.In recent years, breakthroughs in the fabrication of crystalline-amorphous composite materials lead to solids with various excellent properties, such as ultrahigh-strength alloys. These solids can be regarded as polycrystals with thick disordered grain boundaries, but the grain-boundary thickness cannot be well controlled and its influence on the material strength remains unclear. Moreover, how to match the grain size and grain boundary thickness to maximize the strength of the material is yet to be explored.Recently, these questions were studied by Professor Yilong Han of the Department of Physics of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and Zhibin Xu, a Ph.D. student of the HKUST Guangzhou Campus, with the participation of Mengmeng Li, a Ph.D. student of the HKUST, and Professor Huijun Zhang of the School of Materials Science and Technology of Xi'an Jiaotong University,Their computer simulations on 2D solids generalized the material strength from the traditional single-variable function (that is, Hall-Petch and inverse-Hall-Petch relations) to a function with two variables of grain size and grain boundary thickness.They observed that increasing the thickness of the disordered grain boundaries and decreasing the grain diameter had similar effects on the yield stress, that is the strength, because the proportion of disordered structure was increased in both cases. When the average grain diameter was greater than about 50 particles, as the thickness of the grain boundary increased, the strength of the solid initially increased (that is, the strengthening stage) and then weakened (the weakening stage).      Their corresponding mechanisms were the dislocation gliding within the crystalline grains and deformation within grain boundaries, which were similar to the mechanisms of Hall-Petch and inverse-Hall-Petch relations, respectively. When the grain boundary diameter was less than 50 particles, the plastic deformation was entirely within the grain boundary and thus the strengthening stage was absent.\"We find how to properly thicken the grain boundaries to exceed the maximum strength of traditional polycrystals by systematically measuring the mechanical strength in a more comprehensive 2D parameter space. It can guide the manufacture of higher-strength solids,\" Zhibin Xu said.\"The relationship between solid structure and material properties is a key topic in material science and mechanical engineering. Much attentions in these fields are paid to the practical problem of how to mix ordered and disordered structures to achieve the maximum strength in real 3D materials, without making analogies or generalization on the classic Hall-Petch and inverse-Hall-Petch relations. We are more curious about the strength or other properties in a more comprehensive parameter space,\" Yilong Han said.\"Physicists often use simple models to understand general behaviors. Herein we only studied simple 2D solids with Lennard-Jones particle interactions as the first step. The trend of material strength observed in 2D solids should similarly exist in 3D solids because of their similar deformation mechanisms. It is practical to test these results in 3D simulation and experiment in the future.\"Moreover, in contrast to the intensively studied liquid-to-glass transition and the direct collapse of single crystal to glass (i.e. amorphous solid), the polycrystal-to-glass transition has rarely been studied. The previous work by Han's group revealed a sharp polycrystal-to-glass transition for the first time by tuning the grain size. Here, tuning grain-boundary thickness is an alternative route to achieve the polycrystal-to-glass crossover, and thus it provides a novel platform for the study of polycrystal-to-glass transition in the future.The research is published in the journal National Science Open.

To celebrate Hedgehog Awareness Week run by the British Hedgehog Preservation Society from 30thApril to 6th May, a team at the University of Nottingham's Nanoscale and Microscale Research Centre (nmRC) have investigated hedgehog spines using a range of materials characterization techniques including X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).Microscale images were created of the interior and exterior of the spines. One of the most surprising results came from imaging of the cross section of the spine which revealed support segments and hollow sections, similar to when a citrus fruit is cut in half. The images also showed that the exterior had a ribbed surface texture and scaly microstructure.nmRC collaborated with local charity Hedgepigs on this project to raise awareness about hedgehogs by showing the public the inside of a hedgehog spine\u2014something they have probably never have seen before. Dr. Hannah Constantin, XPS technician at the nmRC is a huge fan of hedgehogs and signed the University of Nottingham up to become a Hedgehog Friendly Campus, she imaged the spines alongside electron microscope technician Lorelei Robertson.Hannah says, \"I have very fond memories of watching hedgehogs in my parents' garden when I was a child, they were frequent visitors. As an adult, I started seeing them less and less, and after doing some research, I found out that hedgehog numbers in the UK have declined by 50% since the year 2000. Resolved to do something about it, I discovered the Hedgehog Friendly Campus initiative, and signed the University of Nottingham up. Slowly the group grew, and we now have silver Hedgehog Friendly Campus status and are currently working towards gold.\"\"It's great that the nmRC is helping to raise awareness about hedgehogs and I was keen to be involved. Getting people talking about hedgehogs is a great starting point to help our spiky friends. We have used XPS and SEM to study the elemental composition and structure of hedgehog spines. This is important because it will give conservationists vital information to continue their amazing work.\"Although the project didn't analyze the reasons behind the internal structure of the spines, Hedgehog enthusiast Hannah suggests: \"I would say that the fins allow for a good strength-to weight ratio of the spine. A hollow spine would be light, but easy to bend or crush. A completely solid spine would be strong but heavy. The fins resist bending and crushing, but don't add a lot of weight, and their radial arrangement probably strengthens them in (almost) all directions.\"The hedgehog spines were kindly donated by Deborah Korn from local hedgehog rescue charity Hedgepigs. The results have been collated and a short e-booklet and two posters have been produced as educational resources.Deborah Korn, founder of hedgehog rescue charity Hedgepigs commented: \"Hedgehog Awareness Week is massively important to highlight the plight of one of our nation's favorite wildlife species. Hedgehogs have been around since the days of the saber tooth tiger. But they are now under immense pressure as a species.\"\"They are currently on the UK's Red List, which means they are vulnerable to the point of extinction. We humans are their main problem in their fight to survive, but we can also be the reason that they succeed and keep going for millennia to come. It is vital that we do everything we can to understand them if we are able to help their species survive. This Hedgehog Awareness Week, we are incredibly proud to have been able to help the University of Nottingham take a look at hedgehog spines in a new way using incredible imaging techniques.\" Provided byUniversity of NottinghamCitation:Sharp images show inside a hedgehog spine and reveal citrus-like structure (2023, April 27)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-04-sharp-images-hedgehog-spine-reveal.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Ribonucleic acid (RNA) folds into complex structures, which allow it to interact specifically with other molecules in the cell. In HIV-1, minute differences in RNA folding can be crucial in determining whether viral RNA is \"packaged\" and thus leads to viral replication.          This has now been discovered by researchers at the Helmholtz Institute W\u00fcrzburg by enhancing a method used to study RNA structure with a novel sequencing technology. Their findings could help to design new antivirals and were published today in the journal Nature Methods.Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV) are responsible for millions of infections worldwide. By causing the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), these pathogens have led to nearly 40 million deaths since the outbreak of the HIV pandemic in the 1980s. For decades, scientists have been researching possible antiviral therapeutics, and effective drugs are now available for those infected. However, it is the combination of multiple antivirals with different targets which has revolutionized HIV therapy, and new drugs are continuously needed to combat drug resistance.\"In our study, we're introducing a possible new target to stay one step ahead of HIV and other potentially zoonotic retroviruses,\" says Redmond Smyth. Smyth heads a research group at the Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research (HIRI) in W\u00fcrzburg, a site of the Braunschweig Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI) in cooperation with the Julius-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t (JMU) W\u00fcrzburg, and has led the current study.\"Our new method can distinguish the structural variations between highly similar RNAs, even those created through splicing,\" explains Patrick Bohn, a Ph.D. student in the Smyth lab. The researcher is the co-first author of the study, which was published today in the journal Nature Methods.Splicing is a biological process that, in a sense, refines a cell's genetic blueprint present in the original messenger RNA for subsequent translation into new proteins. \"In higher organisms, splicing generates protein diversity, but our findings indicate that it can also contribute to the biological function by producing novel RNA structures,\" Bohn says.Very similar yet differentThe current findings were obtained by improving a technology to measure how RNA is folded in the cell. Many scientists have attempted to study structures of spliced and unspliced HIV-1 RNA, but this has been challenging because previous technologies only measured RNA structure in small fragments. Scientists at the HIRI have now applied long read sequencing to study RNA structure across the full length of the RNA molecule, and used it to show how the HIV-1 virus selects its full-length RNA for packaging into viral particles.\"We unveiled that HIV-1 RNA folds very differently when spliced\u2014a discovery that reveals the importance of studying biological processes taking into account the complex native environment,\" says Anne-Sophie Gribling-Burrer, who is a post-doctoral researcher and co-first author on the paper. As a result, spliced versions of HIV-1 RNA were shown not to be packaged.\"Spliced RNAs do not have some of the structural features that are required for being packaged, thus providing a mechanism of packaging selectivity and affecting the replication of the virus,\" Gribling-Burrer explains.\"Understanding this mechanism is a key step in developing new antivirals against a wide range of retroviruses,\" states Redmond Smyth. Besides that, the researchers believe their method will be useful to a broad field of molecular biologists in vastly different areas in the future.      Technical backgroundSingle-stranded RNA can fold into complex structures by base pairing. Genome-wide measurements of RNA structure can be obtained using reagents that react with unpaired bases, leading to adducts that can be identified by mutational profiling on next generation sequencing machines.One drawback of these experiments is that short sequencing reads can rarely be mapped to specific transcript isoforms. Consequently, information is acquired as a population average in regions that are shared between transcripts thus blurring the underlying structural landscape.In their study, scientists at the Helmholtz Institute W\u00fcrzburg introduce nanopore dimethyl-sulfate mutational profiling (Nano-DMS-MaP), a method that provides isoform resolved structural information of highly similar RNA molecules.

  "text": "Energy efficient LEDs (light emitting diodes) have begun to replace many types of lighting both indoor and outdoor. A key reason for the rise of LEDs has been materials research that greatly improved the quality and intensity of light achievable with these devices. But those materials must be handled with very high levels of precision, including surfaces that are as defect-free as possible.          \"They're more efficient and last longer,\" said Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) Senior Faculty Scientist Ali Javey, of the materials that comprise today's LED devices, \"but to get good efficiencies, you really have to treat the [material] surfaces to perfection\u2014you have to watch and control the surface chemistry and even then, you still have some light losses.\" Javey is also a professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at the University of California, Berkeley.Javey and his team said their recent research on black phosphorus (BP)\u2014a material of interest for its electronic properties\u2014reveals a tantalizing capability for light emission at the BP surface.It turns out that extremely thin layers of BP can be stimulated to emit useful quantities of light in specific wavelengths. What's more, it will do so without regard to the surface. In fact, they can even let BP oxidize (think rust) and it will still emit light in the mid infrared (IR) without any loss of efficiency.\"We don't do anything special to the surface. We don't do any special chemistry. We don't put down any special protection layers,\" he said.The Javey team published their findings in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.The work is both a fundamental discovery about the properties of BP, and it suggests exciting prospects for applications.\"Black phosphorus is really good for midwave IR light emission and detection,\" Javey said. \"Our group and others have shown very bright midwave IR LEDs before. Mid-IR LEDs using conventional semiconductors are not very efficient due to fundamental materials properties. BP has an inherent advantage in that wavelength range.\"The mid-IR range is of interest for applications in night vision, sensing, spectroscopy, and more, Javey continued. \"Our findings emphasize the unique material characteristics of layered materials for novel optoelectronic applications such as light-emitting devices and photodetectors.\"Getting light from thin black phosphorusThe Javey lab has been investigating the \"magical properties\" of BP for some time. In 2022, they reported that, under mechanical strain, BP can be induced to emit or detect infrared (IR) light dynamically in a range of desirable wavelengths\u20142.3 to 5.5 micrometers, which spans the short- to mid-wave infrared\u2014and to do so reversibly at room temperature.\"In this new paper, we look at how the light emission mechanism changes when we change the thickness of BP,\" said co-author Shiekh Uddin. In thick units of BP, electrons and holes\u2014that is, negatively and positively charged particles\u2014can generate light when they collide with each other.\"Thinned below a few nanometers, however, the electrons and holes at the BP surface are so confined that they combine like magnets drawn together in a pocket. This excited state, called exciton, emits the light more efficiently than isolated electrons and holes.\"Importantly, we find the surface is less detrimental to the luminescence efficiency owing to the inherent crystal structure of BP,\" said co-author Naoki Higashitarumizu. It turns out that BP has an unusually low surface recombination velocity. That is a measure of how quickly carriers\u2014electrons or holes\u2014are lost on the material's surface without generating light.In fact, the surface recombination velocity of BP is two orders of magnitude lower than for other materials, Uddin said. This is true even when the surface has been oxidized or damaged due to environmental exposure. As a result, we can achieve bright-light emission even when BP is made very thin.Moving forward, Javey said, \"We believe the low surface recombination is not limited to BP but should also be applicable to other layered materials with similar crystal structures.\" More information:Naoki Higashitarumizu et al, Anomalous thickness dependence of photoluminescence quantum yield in black phosphorous, Nature Nanotechnology (2023).

  "text": "A team of researchers, led by University of Texas at Dallas scientists, has developed a new technique to grow exceptionally large, high-quality crystals that could help make advanced electronics, such as spintronic and magnetic optoelectronic devices, a reality.          Very thin layers\u2014just one or two atoms thick\u2014can be exfoliated easily from the bulk crystals. These two-dimensional layers exhibit surprising magnetic properties and are very stable in air at room temperature, making them of interest for use in devices that incorporate stacked layers of different materials.Dr. Wenhao Liu, a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Physics in the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, developed the solid-vapor synthesis technique to grow chromium sulfide bromide crystals, which typically are made through the chemical vapor transport (CVT) method. The paper is published in the journal ACS Nano.\"Although this material itself is not new, our method to create it stands out from other methods,\" said Liu, who works in the lab of Dr. Bing Lv, associate professor of physics and a corresponding author of the report on this new technique. \"Our method is simpler, more direct and yields much bigger and higher-quality crystals than the conventional CVT method.\"The synthesis technique, which involves the simple usage of a box furnace, produces crystals of 1 to 2 centimeters, which is 10 times larger than those produced with other methods, said Lv (pronounced \"love\").The magnetic properties of exfoliated layers surprised the research team.                Dr. Bing Lv (left), associate professor of physics, and Dr. Wenhao Liu, a postdoctoral research associate, examine a chromium sulfide bromide crystal they produced with a new method developed by Liu. The magnetic properties in the crystal may make the material easier to work with in the development of new devices. Credit: University of Texas at Dallas             Each electron in a material has a property called spin, which can be either up or down, and the orientation of spins determines the material's magnetic properties. For example, when all the spins are aligned in the same direction, the material is ferromagnetic, whereas when spins are aligned parallel but in opposite directions\u2014antiparallel\u2014the material is antiferromagnetic.\"Typically, this magnetic ordering\u2014the alignment of spins\u2014takes place instantaneously in a material,\" Lv said. \"The uniqueness of our 2D material is that antiferromagnetic order increases and propagates throughout the crystal in three stages as we lower the temperature.\"Magnetic anomalies\u2014increases in the magnitude of ferromagnetic order\u2014occur in the material at 185 kelvins (minus 126.7 degrees Fahrenheit), 156 kelvins (minus 178.9 degrees Fahrenheit) and 132 kelvins (minus 222 degrees Fahrenheit).      \"This is the first time this phenomenon has been observed in chromium sulfide bromide crystals. I didn't believe it when we first saw this because it goes against our intuitive thinking,\" Lv said. \"It is an interesting observation, because this kind of 'soft' magnetism might be useful in certain magnetic memory devices.\"The crystal is stable in air, a convenient and essential property for future research and possible use in high-performance devices, Liu said.\"Typical crystals can react with water or oxygen in the air, which changes the chemical composition or structure of the crystal,\" said Liu, who is a co-lead author of the report. \"That's why in many cases, crystals have to be capped with an inert material. Our crystal removes that barrier, which makes it easier to work with for new device fabrication and development.\" More information:Wenhao Liu et al, A Three-Stage Magnetic Phase Transition Revealed in Ultrahigh-Quality van der Waals Bulk Magnet CrSBr, ACS Nano (2022).

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the chemistry professor who helped solve the puzzle of hydrogel formation?",
  "answer_squad": " Ann-Christin P\u00f6ppler",
  "text": "Many people use hydrogels without knowing it. As superabsorbents in nappies, for example, hydrogels absorb a lot of liquid. In the process, the initially dry material becomes jelly-like, but it does not wet. Some people place the swellable material on their eyeballs\u2014soft contact lenses are also just hydrogels. The same goes for jelly and other everyday materials.          Hydrogels also play a role in science. From a chemical point of view, they are long, three-dimensionally cross-linked polymer molecules that form cavities. Inside, they can absorb and hold water molecules.In the working group of former W\u00fcrzburg chemistry professor Robert Luxenhofer, the suitability of hydrogels for biofabrication is being tested: For example, hydrogels can be used for 3D printing as scaffold structures, on which cells can be attached. In this way, for example, artificial tissues can be produced for medical research and regenerative therapies.Hydrogel formation posed a puzzleDuring this research, Dr. Lukas Hahn in Luxenhofer's team noticed an unusual form of hydrogel formation. He observed it in polymers intended for nanomedicine, specifically for drug delivery.These polymers arrange themselves into spherical nanoparticles in water at 40 degrees. When the water is cooled to below 32 degrees, the spheres cluster into worm-like structures and a gel is formed. When heated, it dissolves again.\"This behavior is very rare in synthetic polymers and was completely unexpected,\" explains Robert Luxenhofer, who now teaches and researches at the University of Helsinki. If it does occur, the gel formation is usually due to hydrogen bonds\u2014attractive forces between polar functional groups involving hydrogen atoms that have a stabilizing effect. Such interactions are of central importance for the structure and function of proteins, for example.However, things are quite different with the polymers we are dealing with here. In terms of their chemical structure, they are not capable of forming hydrogen bonds with each other. Apparently, the researchers had stumbled upon an unknown mechanism of gel formation.      Breakthrough with NMR spectroscopyTo solve the puzzle, Robert Luxenhofer sought a cooperation with chemistry professor Ann-Christin P\u00f6ppler at Julius-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrzburg (JMU), an expert in the characterization of nanoparticles made of polymers. In cooperation with other research groups, her team took a closer look at the peculiar form of gel formation\u2014a complex puzzle that took a good two years to solve.\"We were able to elucidate the unknown mechanism because we used a wide variety of analytical tools. In the end, however, the breakthrough came with various methods of NMR spectroscopy,\" explains the JMU chemist. Her doctoral student Theresa Zorn found out what leads to gel formation in this case: specific interactions between amide groups of the water-soluble and phenyl rings of the non-water-soluble polymer building blocks. These interactions cause the spherical nanoparticles to condense and restructure into worm-like structures.The findings could be confirmed by theoretical calculations: Dr. Josef Kehrein, a former Ph.D. student of JMU professor Christoph Sotriffer, an expert in computer-aided modeling of three-dimensional interactions between molecules, succeeded in doing so. He, too, is now working in Helsinki.The results have been published in ACS Nano.Next stepsWhere do we go from here? The researchers are convinced that the newly discovered mechanism of hydrogel formation is also relevant for other polymers and for their interactions with biological tissues.Therefore, the team wants to chemically modify the polymers to see how this affects their properties and hydrogelation. It may be possible to specifically influence the gelation temperature as well as the strength and durability of the gel. From the modified materials, one could select those that are most suitable for use in biofabrication.Ann-Christin P\u00f6ppler's team also wants to investigate whether the nanoparticles and thus also the hydrogel can be loaded with \"guest molecules.\" This might be interesting for medical applications\u2014if the gel dissolves at body temperature, it could release the active substances with which it was previously loaded. Applications in the form of implants, plasters or contact lenses are conceivable.

  "text": "Small amounts of nanometer-thin metal-organic layers efficiently protect red blood cells during freezing and thawing, as a team of researchers writing in the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition has discovered. The nanolayers, made from metal-organic frameworks based on the metal hafnium, prevent ice crystal formation at very low concentrations. This effective novel cryoprotection mode could be used to develop new and more efficient cryoprotectants for the biosciences.          Cryoprotectants prevent ice crystals from forming when samples are frozen. Growing crystals can damage delicate cell membranes and cell components and disrupt cell integrity. Some solvents or polymers make good cryoprotectants; they keep ice crystal formation in check by binding water molecules and disrupting their ordered assembly during ice formation.Synthetic chemistry has yet more tricks up its sleeve for targeting and influencing ice formation in a more effective way. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are three-dimensional crystalline networks of metal ions linked by organic ligands. These ligands can be tailored to bind small molecules such as water, allowing the assembly of the water molecules into ice crystals to be very precisely tuned.Wei Zhu from the South China University of Technology in Guangzhou (China) and colleagues have now discovered that as MOFs based on hafnium and organic ligands become thinner, their ability to bind and influence water molecules increases, mainly because more ligand sites are available. The team therefore developed a method for controlled deconstruction of the three-dimensional metal-organic frameworks until only two-dimensional thin nanolayers remain.To test the suitability of their hafnium-MOLs (MOL stands for metal-organic layer, to distinguish them from three-dimensional MOFs) as cryoprotectants, the team froze red blood cells, a type of cell that needs to be stored in large numbers for medical purposes but is easily destroyed by ice crystal formation. Compared to the hydroxyethyl starch (HES), which is commonly used as a cryoprotectant, hafnium MOLs showed excellent cryoprotection at a minimal concentration of less than 0.1%, whereas the HES solutions are typically used at concentrations of up to 30%.Zhu and the team explained that the MOLs are so effective because the irregular two-dimensional structure of the ligands binding the water molecules prevents the formation of regular ice crystal nuclei. The team suggest that the dimensional reduction of MOFs is an interesting new perspective for obtaining highly efficient cryoprotectants.

  "text": "Iron oxide nanoparticles are often used in medical technology as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging or as transport agents for drugs in the bloodstream, for example in tumor therapy. For these applications, the nanoparticles have to be biocompatible and superparamagnetic. Thus, they must be strongly magnetizable in a magnetic field and also must lose their magnetization when the magnetic field is switched off. Using analytical high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, a team at TU Bergakademie Freiberg investigated how the magnetic properties of the nanoparticles can further be improved via microstructure design.          The researchers published their results in the current issue of Scientific Reports.The knowledge of the exact structure of the iron oxide nanoparticles sized between 20 and 30 nanometers helps to optimize the manufacturing process and to improve the magnetic properties of the particles systematically. Each particle consists of at least two superparamagnetic nanocrystalline cores and a shell that does not contribute to the magnetic properties. The maximum magnetization of the nanoparticles depends on the mutual orientation of the individual cores.How well are the cores oriented to each other?\"The current state of research assumed that a strong alignment of magnetic moments in multi-core iron oxide nanoparticles is enabled by the same crystallographic orientation of individual cores. However, our analyses showed that this is not necessarily true,\" says Stefan Neumann, research associate at TU Bergakademie Freiberg and the first author of the publication.\"Also other, but still specific crystallographic orientation relationships of the cores can promote their magnetic interaction. Nevertheless, a fully random alignment of the cores deteriorates the magnetic properties of the nanoparticles,\" says Neumann.\"In order to be able to produce highly superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for future applications in medicine on demand, we need knowledge of their internal structure,\" says co-author Prof. David Rafaja, head of the Institute of Materials Science at TU Bergakademie Freiberg. \"During the production of the nanoparticles, individual cores are formed first. When the cores get more time to align in the right way, then the magnetic properties of the nanoparticles can further be improved.\"Background: Analyzing ultra-fine particlesThe results were obtained within the priority program \"MehrDimPart\u2014Highly Specific and Multidimensional Fractionation of Fine Particle Systems with Technical Relevance.\" The aim of the research is to develop technological approaches that enable a controlled production of highly specific and technologically relevant particle systems with desired properties.In addition to the team from TU Bergakademie Freiberg, scientists from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology have also contributed to the current publication.

  "text": "High-frequency light is useful. The higher the frequency of light, the shorter its wavelength\u2014and the shorter the wavelength, the smaller the objects and details the light can be used to see.          So violet light can show you smaller details than red light, for example, because it has a shorter wavelength. But to see really, really small things\u2014down to the scale of billionths of a meter, thousands of times less than the width of a human hair\u2014to see those things, you need extreme ultraviolet light (and a good microscope).Extreme ultraviolet light, with wavelengths between 10 and 120 nanometers, has many applications in medical imaging, studying biological objects, and deciphering the fine details of computer chips during their manufacture. However, producing small and affordable sources of this light has been very challenging.We have found a way to make nanoparticles of a common semiconductor material emit light with a frequency up to seven times higher than the frequency of light sent to it. We generated blue-violet light from infrared light, and it will be possible to generate extreme ultraviolet light from red light with the same principles. Our research, carried out with colleagues from the University of Brescia, the University of Arizona and Korea University, is published in Science Advances.The power of harmonicsOur system starts out with an ordinary laser that produces long-wavelength infrared light. This is called the pump laser, and there's nothing special about it\u2014such lasers are commercially available, and they can be compact and affordable.But next we fire short pulses of light from this laser at a specially engineered nanoparticle of a material called aluminum gallium arsenide, and that's where things get interesting.The nanoparticle absorbs energy from the laser pulses, and then emits its own burst of light. By carefully engineering the size and shape of the nanoparticle, we can create powerful resonances to amplify certain harmonics of the emitted light.What does that mean, exactly? Well, we can make a useful analogy with sound.When you pluck a string on a guitar, it vibrates with what's called its fundamental frequency\u2014which makes the main note you hear\u2014plus small amounts of higher frequencies called harmonics, which are multiples of the fundamental frequency. The body of the guitar is designed to produce resonances that amplify some of these harmonics and dampen others, creating the overall sound you hear.                Harmonics in a guitar string: in the fundamental frequency, the wavelength is the length of the whole string, but in the higher harmonics multiple shorter wavelengths fit within the length of the string. Credit: Wikimedia / Y Landman Both light and sound share similarities in their physics\u2014these are both propagating waves (acoustic waves in the case of sound, and electromagnetic waves in the case of light).In our light source, the pump laser is like the main note of the string, and the nanoparticles are like the guitar body. Except what's special about the nanoparticles is that they massively amplify those higher harmonics of the pump laser, producing light with a higher frequency (up to seven times higher in our case, and a wavelength correspondingly seven times shorter).      What it's good forThis technology allows us to create new sources of light in parts of the electromagnetic spectrum such as the extreme ultraviolet, where there are no natural sources of light and where current engineered sources are too large or too expensive.Conventional microscopes using visible light can only study objects down to a size of about a ten-millionth of a meter. The resolution is limited by the wavelength of light: violet light has the wavelength of about 400 nanometers (one nanometre is one billionth of a meter).But there are plenty of applications, such as biological imaging and electronics manufacturing, where being able to see down to a billionth of a meter or so would be a huge help.At present, to see at those scales you need \"super-resolution\" microscopy, which lets you see details smaller than the wavelength of the light you are using, or electron microscopes, which do not use light at all and create image using a flux of electrons. However, such methods are quite slow and expensive.To understand the advantages of a light source like ours, consider computer chips: they are made of very tiny components with feature sizes almost as small as a billionth of a meter. During the production process, it would be useful for manufacturers to use extreme ultraviolet light to monitor the process in real time.This would save resources and time on bad batches of chips. The scale of the industry is such that even a 1% increase in chip yields could save billions of dollars each year.In future, nanoparticles like ours could be used to produce tiny, inexpensive sources of extreme ultraviolet light, illuminating the world of extremely small things.

  "text": "Molecular aggregates are clusters of small molecules held together by relatively weak forces believed to be originating from electronic interactions between the molecules. Owing to their exceptional photophysical properties, molecular aggregates find unique applications in many areas of technology and continue to be a subject of intense research. In fact, researchers have utilized molecular aggregates to engineer a variety of functional materials, biomedical tools, and nanodevices.          However, the phenomenon of molecular aggregation is not limited to small molecules alone. Individual polymer segment chains can also interact with one another and give rise to phenomena that are very similar to those found in molecular aggregates. One such example is polyfluorene, a conjugated polymer that, when excited by UV radiation or an appropriate electric field, emits a bright blue light in solution.Despite being a well-researched polymer, the spectral peaks for polyfluorene have long been the subject of speculation. It turns out that, in addition to the blue emission, it occasionally also emits a green emission, the cause of which has been debated in the scientific community. One plausible explanation for the green emission is that it results from the occurrence of photooxidation reaction. However, there is also evidence that favors the interchain aggregation of chain segments as a cause.A group of researchers from Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, led by Professor Martin Vacha, recently developed an innovative experimental protocol that aimed to resolve this knowledge gap. In their study published in ACS Nano, the researchers combined two microscopy techniques to perform precise photomechanical measurements in poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PFO), a prototypical kind of polyfluorene.First, a single PFO chain was chemically attached to the tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM) on one end and to a transparent substrate on the other end. Initially folded, the PFO chain was then stretched slowly by precisely controlling the position of the AFM tip.As a result, the AFM could constantly gauge the amount of mechanical force required for the PFO chain to stretch. Simultaneously, the team measured the spectra of the light emitted by PFO upon UV illumination using a fluorescence microscope placed beneath the substrate. This helped them study the changes in emission spectrum of the PFO chain with mechanical stretching.They observed a green emission band accompanying the blue emission band during the initial stage of stretching. The green emission band disappeared eventually as the folded chain was stretched and the intra-chain aggregates broke up, which was confirmed by the AFM measurements.Explaining these observations, Prof. Vacha says, \"Our work presents a direct evidence that the green emission band is observed due to intra-chain aggregation of PFO, which undergoes breakup on mechanical unfolding, and results in the disappearance of the green emission.\"Additionally, the team also observed additional spectral features, suggesting a novel optomechanical force acting on some of the PFO chains. On further analysis, they found this force to be originating from the breakup of intra-chain aggregate coupling upon UV illumination. The nature of this coupling was determined through precise analyses.Prof. Vacha highlights, \"The force by which the aggregate was coupled and the length for which the coupling was effective revealed that this optomechanical force results from van der Waals interactions and excitonic coupling.\"These pioneering techniques could find intriguing applications in a variety of fields, including energy conversion in molecular motors or the nano-mechanical manipulation of molecular properties in polymer chains and molecular nanofibers.

  "text": "To develop cancer drugs, researchers often have to make tough trade-offs. Most drugs potent enough to kill tumors also cause unpleasant side effects\u2014and may end up doing more harm than good. Now, researchers and clinicians at Stevens Institute of Technology and Hackensack Meridian Health have developed a new drug delivery system that uses gold nanoparticles to deliver drugs to tumors with remarkable precision\u2014while dramatically reducing the potential for systemic side-effects.          In a paper published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, the team describes the ability to pack and seal drugs into a porous gold nano-framework, then apply a hyaluronic acid coating on the outer surface of the nanoparticle to further seal the drug inside. The result is an extremely stable particle that only gives up its payload when it binds to hyaluronic acid receptors on the surface of a lymphoma tumor.\"Gold is very stable, so it's the perfect material for drug delivery,\" explained Hongjun Wang, a professor of biomedical engineering and the director of the Semcer Center for Healthcare Innovation at Stevens who led the research together with Johannes Zarkzweski, a physician at Hackensack. \"Using this approach, we're able to deliver drugs much more precisely and get much better clinical outcomes.\"Because the drugs are delivered selectively, with minimal leakage into the bloodstream, significantly lower quantities of drugs can be used to treat a tumor, reducing the risk of toxic side effects. In animal studies, the team found no sign of toxicity and no detectable levels of drugs in the bloodstream, despite the fact that the chemicals they were delivering ordinarily cause detectable toxicity in 50% of subjects.The gold nanoparticles continue to circulate in the bloodstream much longer than free-floating drug molecules, meaning that patients who currently receive daily treatments might be able to switch to weekly or bi-weekly regimens. In animal trials, lymphoma tumors also responded markedly better to the targeted drug delivery than to non-targeted treatments, suggesting that new treatment protocols could be developed to improve outcomes in human cancer patients.Using gold as a delivery system opens the door to other clinical applications, including the use of tumor-seeking gold nanoparticles as a contrast agent to enable more precise imaging. The particles can also be heated by shining harmless light energy into the patient's body, effectively \"cooking\" tumors from within. They can also be calibrated to deliver their pharmaceutical payload only when triggered by incoming light, providing additional control over how and when drugs are delivered.The nanoparticles can be loaded with drugs very quickly and efficiently, using inexpensive and scalable chemical processes\u2014a fact that should help offset the expense of using gold to deliver pharmaceuticals. \"Cost is always a concern, of course,\" said Wang. \"But this is a simple methodology, and we think the benefits speak for themselves.\"While the current study focused on validating the use of gold nanoparticle drug delivery systems in animals, Wang hopes to see the approach developed for testing in human cancer patients. \"We've shown this works in animals\u2014now we need to show it's safe in people, too,\" he explained. Pharmaceutical companies are already showing interest in the approach, and the FDA has already approved the use of gold in other clinical applications, he noted.In the meantime, Wang added, the primary research goal is to develop more sophisticated outer pore sealants that rely on antibodies to target other, harder-to-treat tumors with similarly high specificity.\"Our ultimate goal is to use this approach to target multiple myeloma and other cancers that are currently not curable,\" said Wang. \"I hope we can complete the foundational research and push this forward to clinical trials soon.\" More information:Manpreet Bariana et al, Targeted Lymphoma Therapy Using a Gold Nanoframework-Based Drug Delivery System, ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2023).

  "text": "Physicists at the Australian National University (ANU) are using nanoparticles to develop new sources of light that will allow us to \"peel back the curtain\" into the world of extremely small objects\u2014thousands of times smaller than a human hair\u2014with major gains for medical and other technologies.          The findings, published in Science Advances, could have major implications for medical science by offering an affordable and effective solution to analyze tiny objects that are too small for microscopes to see, let alone the human eye. The work could also be beneficial for the semiconductor industry and improving quality control of the fabrication of computer chips. The ANU technology uses carefully engineered nanoparticles to increase the frequency of light that cameras and other technologies see by up to seven times. The researchers say there is \"no limit\" to how high the frequency of light can be increased. The higher the frequency, the smaller the object we are able to see using that light source.The technology, which requires only a single nanoparticle to work, could be implemented into microscopes to help scientists zoom into the world of super small things at 10 times the resolution of conventional microscopes. This would enable researchers to study objects that would otherwise be too small to see, such as the inner structures of cells and individual viruses.Being able to analyze such small objects could help scientists better understand and fight certain diseases and health conditions.\"Conventional microscopes are only able to study objects bigger than about a ten-millionth of a meter. However, there is growing demand across a range of sectors, including the medical field, to be able to analyze much smaller objects down to one billionth of a meter,\" lead author Dr. Anastasiia Zalogina, from the ANU Research School of Physics and the University of Adelaide, said.\"Our technology could help meet that demand.\"The researchers say the ANU-developed nanotech could help create a new generation of microscopes that can produce much more detailed images.      \"Scientists who want to generate a highly-magnified image of an extremely small, nanoscale object can't use a conventional optical microscope. Instead, they must rely on either super-resolution microscopy techniques or use an electron microscope to study these tiny objects,\" Dr. Zalogina said.\"But such techniques are slow and the technology is very expensive, often costing more than a million dollars.\"Another disadvantage of electron microscopy is that it may damage delicate samples being analyzed, whereas light-based microscopes mitigate this issue.\"Beams of light that we perceive as different colors of the rainbow are electromagnetic waves that oscillate with different frequencies.What we see as red is the lowest frequency that our eyes can detect. Even lower frequencies not visible to the human eye are called infra-red. Violet has the highest light frequency that we can see. Ultraviolet, which has an even higher frequency, is invisible to the human eye.Although our eyes cannot detect infra-red and ultraviolet light, it is possible for us to \"see\" it using cameras and other technologies.Co-author Dr. Sergey Kruk, also from ANU, said researchers are interested in achieving very high frequencies of light, also known as \"extreme-ultraviolet.\"\"With violet light we can see much smaller things compared to using red light. And with extreme-ultraviolet light sources we can see things beyond what's possible using conventional microscopes of today,\" Dr. Kruk said.Dr. Kruk said the ANU technology could also be used in the semiconductor industry as a quality control measure to ensure a streamlined manufacturing process.\"Computer chips consist of very tiny components with feature sizes almost as small as one billionth of a meter. During the chip production process, it would be beneficial for manufacturers to use tiny sources of extreme-ultraviolet light to monitor this process in real-time to diagnose any problems early on,\" he said.\"That way manufacturers could save resources and time on bad batches of chips, thereby increasing yields of chip manufacturing. It's estimated that a one percent increase in yields of computer chip manufacturing translates into two billion dollars in savings.\"Australia's booming optics and photonics industry is represented by nearly 500 companies and accounts for about $4.3 billion of economic activity, making our high-tech ecosystem well positioned to adopt new types of light sources in order to reach new global markets in nanotechnology industries and research.\" More information:Anastasiia Zalogina et al, High-harmonic generation from a subwavelength dielectric resonator, Science Advances (2023).

  "text": "Griffith University researchers are behind some major breakthroughs on the micro and nano scale, with recent research finding that getting more detailed breakdowns on wearable device owners' overall health stats could soon become a reality.          Dr. Jun Zhang and Dr. Navid Kashaninejad from Griffith's Queensland Micro- and Nanotechnology Center conduct research on two current challenges of a field known as microfluidics: biosampling through the separation of nanoparticles; and wearable technologies.The two researchers have published their outcomes on this work, under the mentorship of QMNC Director Professor Nam-Trung Nguyen, who is renowned for his research in micro elastofluidics.What is micro elastofluidics?Micro elastofluidics uses bendiness and stretchiness to enable fluid handling that leads to faster and more accurate diagnosis of health conditions.\"This technology allows for precise handling of small amount of samples and reagents,\" Professor Nguyen said.\"My research has been aiming at medium-term impact and has moved from sensors for cars to shrinking down a lab onto a chip to wearable devices for health monitoring.\"For instance, the QMNC research team has developed a range of cell stretching devices for studying cell behavior under mechanical stress. Ongoing works are on skin models, skin cancer models, gut models and blood vessel models.\"As a complement to this fundamental research, I've recently established the field called 'micro elasofluidics' that uses stretchability and flexibility from molecular scale to device scale for better handling of liquid samples,\" Professor Nguyen said.\"It integrates microfluidics into flexible wearable and implantable devices.\"Benefits of separating nanoparticlesDr. Zhang's recent research has focused on the separation of nanoparticles and how they can be used to gather information on different health conditions.These nanoparticles can be extracellular \"vesicles,\" which are particles secreted by cells in our body as a way to communicate.\"Extracting these particles from liquid samples such as blood would provide a wealth of information on health conditions,\" Dr. Zhang said.\"The same particles may have anti-inflammation and anti-aging effects and potentially serve as therapeutics against aging and age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's.\"The challenge is to separate the particles without damaging the delicate surface. Current techniques such as ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration often damage these particles.Dr. Zhang's method uses a unique fluid physics phenomenon called \"inertial microfluidics\" to avoid damaging these useful but delicate particles.\"Advances in microfluidic technologies have made a significant impact on the biomedical field,\" Dr. Zhang said.\"Microfluidic technologies offer an unprecedented capability to precisely control the motion of fluids and the dissolved or suspended analytes at microscale.\"\"These analytes could be various blood cells, bacteria, virus, DNA, RNA, proteins, glucose, lipid etc. And precisely manipulating and detecting these tiny particles is critical for disease diagnosis and monitoring health conditions in the human body.\"We have recently been invited to publish a critical review in Lab on a Chip.\"We compared the traditional methods and microfluidics on separating nanoparticles in this paper. The conventional techniques generally possess the advantages of time efficiency, high yield, ease of use and good reproducibility, but they are limited by the high cost and low purity. Microfluidic technologies are superior in enhanced separation resolution and more cost-effective.\"Over the past decade, significant progress has been achieved in microfluidic technology for separating nanoparticles with a broad range of applications, however, there is still a considerable gap to be filled. We have explored the challenges and solutions to these limitations that are often overlooked.\"      Biosamples from wearable devices?Dr. Kashaninejad's research explores the collection of health condition information via wearable devices, using the concept of micro elastofluidics.Currently, wearable devices such as smart watches can only collect physical information from the wearer. Collecting information about biochemical and biological conditions is much more difficult because of the lack of \"fluid handling\" capability of these devices.Dr. Kashaninejad's research explores simple, practical solutions for liquid handling on flexible and skin-conformal surfaces so that solutions for sampling sweat and subdermal body fluids can be easily investigated.\"We will find these solutions in the near future in wearable devices that can provide more information about the health condition of the wearer than the current smartwatch,\" he said.\"On-skin wearable systems for biofluid sampling and biomarker sensing can revolutionize the current practices in health care monitoring and personalized medicine.\"However, there is still a long path toward complete market adoption and acceptance of this fascinating technology.\"My recent paper [published in Lab on a Chip] compared various microfluidic platforms that could be used for on-skin wearable devices. These platforms include semiconductor-based, polymer-based, liquid metal-based, paper-based, and textile-based microfluidics.\"These platforms can enhance the stretchability of on-skin wearable biosensors at the device level, and there are potential microfluidic solutions for collecting, transporting, and controlling the biofluids.\"The application of finger-powered micropumps is a viable solution for precise and on-demand biofluid pumping.\"There is great potential in this field, such as the applications of stretchable continuous-flow micro elastofluidics, stretchable superhydrophobic surfaces, liquid beads\u2014tiny capsules with liquid content\u2014as a form of digital micro elastofluidics, and topological liquid diodes that receive less attention but have enormous potential to be integrated into on-skin wearable devices.\" More information:Samith Hettiarachchi et al, Recent microfluidic advances in submicron to nanoparticle manipulation and separation, Lab on a Chip (2022).

  "text": "Researchers led by Prof. Wei Yayi from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) have improved the final pattern fidelity in near-field nanolithography, a breakthrough in understanding the near-field diffraction limit of an evanescent-field-based patterning system.          The results, published in Microsystems & Nanoengineering, is the first to investigate the physical origin of the near-field optical proximity effect (OPE), and the theoretical calculations and simulation results indicate that the evanescent-field-induced rapid loss of high-k information is one of the main optical contributors to the near-field OPE.As the feature size is continuously scaled down, the pattern profile generated by a near-field lithography exhibits very poor pattern quality due to the near-field OPE, far below the minimum requirement for nanofabrication. Therefore, it is essential to minimize the near-field OPE in order to achieve the highest pattern resolution and fidelity possible with the plasmonic lithography process.In this study, the researchers investigated the physical concepts behind the near-field OPE in a maskless plasmonic lithography, and proposed a near-field optical proximity correction (OPC) method via the spatial modulation of nanopatterns to improve the final pattern quality.                Schematic of the maskless plasmonic lithography system with a scanning plasmonic bowtie nanoaperture. Credit: UCAS             Precise OPC requires accurate exposure, so numerical calculations were performed to estimate the point spread function and quantitatively analyze the near-field enhancement effect and the size-dependence of the plasmonic near-field.Furthermore, an analytical formula was proposed to quantitatively analyze the effect of the rapidly decaying feature of the evanescent field on the near-field OPE, and the theoretical limit of the pattern fidelity.In view of the features of the near-field OPE in plasmonic lithography, a fast and effective method for correcting the evanescent-field-induced high-k information loss by exposure dose compensation in advance in the exposure dose map was carried out.

  "text": "The explosion of two-dimensional layered materials (2DLMs) with various unique properties provides basic building blocks for van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs). The vdWHs integrated with various stacking alignments of 2DLMs exhibit many promising functionalities in diverse fields, including electronics, optoelectronics, thermoelectrics, sensing and energy conversion and storage. In addition, the accompanying novel physical phenomena in vdWHs make vdWHs a perfect platform for exploring condensed matter physics, especially in low-dimensional domains.          To meet the demands in different fields, many strategies for the fabrication of vdWHs have been developed in the past decade. The vdWHs obtained by different fabricating strategies differ in key properties, such as layer number, cleanliness, defect density, and interface uniformity, which determine their application performance.Publishing in the journal International Journal of Extreme Manufacturing, the team led by researchers based at the City University of Hongkong have summarized the current state of development in the fabrication and applications of vdWHs to facilitate more rational designs of vdWHs for deeper exploration of the low-dimensional world.The team introduced the mechanism and process of major strategies to fabricate vdWHs, and compared the key characteristics of vdWHs prepared via different methods. Then, the potential applications of vdWHs in electronics, optoelectronics, as well as energy conversion and storage were demonstrated. The moir\u00e9 superlattices based on resonant emissions as representatives of emerging novel physical phenomena were also illustrated. Finally, challenges and potential opportunities of fabrications and applications of vdWHs were outlined.The director of the research team, HE Qiyuan, said \"It is no exaggeration to say that the emergence of two-dimensional materials has provided us with a new avenue for further exploration of the world. With the exploration of 2D materials, researchers have begun to work on modulating and optimizing the properties and performance of 2D materials to meet the requirements of different practical applications. Integrating various 2D materials into vdWHs is one of the most promising strategies.\"\"VdWHs not only greatly enrich the 2D-material library but also are accompanied by numerous novel and unique physical phenomena and properties, such as moir\u00e9 patterns, synergistic effect, fractal quantum hall effect, and resonant tunneling phenomenon, making vdWHs an excellent platform for studying condensed matter physics. Furthermore, the design idea of vdWHs is practically not limited to 2D materials, and it also shows great potential in collocations of materials in varying dimensions, including 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D. This opens up opportunities to construct comprehensive and coherent full-dimensional physical models.\"      Thus, there is an urgent need to develop universal and controllable fabrication methods for vdWHs. This review discusses the state of the art of vdWHs fabrication, and the major strategies are categorized into four classes: physical combination, gas-phase deposition, solvothermal synthesis and synchronous evolution.Co-first author Ph.D. student QI Junlei said, \"The vdWHs obtained by various fabrication methods have advantages and disadvantages regarding their characteristics and performance. Therefore, choosing suitable synthetic methods in different application fields is particularly crucial.\"This review illustrated the integration design based on the vdWHs in electronics, photodetectors and energy-related applications. In addition, it discussed the fundamental research on novel physical phenomena represented by moir\u00e9 superlattice. Combined with the application examples, it can be proved that the suitable applications of vdWHs obtained by different synthesis methods are pretty different.For example, relatively controllable mechanical assemblies are ideal for studying physical phenomena which require high-quality interfaces. Meanwhile, solvothermal methods with high yields and multiple active sites are more suitable for applications such as catalysis and energy storage.Dr. He said, \"Remarkable progress has been made in the fabrication and applications of vdWHs in the past decade, but our excavation of vdWHs is still the tip of the iceberg. On the one hand, a general synthetic method for the scalable and controllable preparation of vdWHs by design has not yet been realized, and the contradiction between high quality and high yield remains unresolved.\"\"Although challenges are ubiquitous, the performance of devices based on vdWHs has surpassed many traditional materials. They can be used to reveal and study physical phenomena that conventional methods could not realize. It is undeniable that vdWHs have become a force to be reckoned with in multidisciplinary research and multifield applications.\" More information:Junlei Qi et al, Fabrication and applications of van der Waals heterostructures, International Journal of Extreme Manufacturing (2023).

  "text": "When oil contaminates water, it creates a film that reduces oxygen levels and introduces toxic substances. This can lead to the death of aquatic plants and animals, contaminate soil, and ultimately threaten human health.          Separating oil from polluted water is therefore of great importance. Current methods can be expensive and challenging, and some may introduce further pollutants into the system. For example, membrane materials can act as a barrier to intercept oil, but their efficiency is low and they aren't suited for long-term use.In Biointerphases, researchers in China developed a fabrication method to increase the efficacy and longevity of membrane separation technology. The technology is greater than 99% effective at separating a petroleum ether-in-water emulsion.The team created a nanofibrous membrane with electrospinning, in which a liquid polymer droplet is electrified and stretched to make fibers. They increased the roughness of the membrane surface by loading it with silver nanoparticles.In water, this rough surface promotes a stable layer of water, which acts as a barrier to prevent oil droplets from entering the membrane.\"This hydration layer efficiently impedes the passage of oil droplets, reducing membrane pollution and enhancing the composite membrane's permeability and separation efficiency,\" said author Jindan Wu.Silver nanoparticles also enhance the membrane's antibacterial properties. Incorporating them minimizes the risk of membrane corrosion that can be caused by microorganisms.\"We have discovered that the membrane's surface roughness and hydration layer strength are critical factors that impact its separation performance and anti-fouling ability,\" said Wu. \"This concept of depositing particles on nanofibrous membranes also has potential for broad applications with other materials.\"The current output capabilities of this fabrication method are relatively low. However, the group hopes developing such materials will contribute to a comprehensive solution for treating water pollution.\"Water pollution is caused by multiple sources, and oily wastewater is just one of them,\" said Wu. \"It is of vital importance to develop materials that can treat for dyes, heavy metals, and bacteria present in water.\" More information:Jindan Wu et al, Polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous membrane composited with zeolite imidazole skeleton-8 and silver nanoclusters for efficient antibacterial and emulsion separation, Biointerphases (2023).

However, the innate property (encoding gene) of these DNA nanostructures has rarely been displayed for gene therapy.       In a study published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, Ding Baoquan's group from the National Center for Nanoscience and Technology (NCNST) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) has devised a genetically encoded DNA origami for targeted and precise gene therapy in vivo.\"The key design of the genetically encoded DNA origami is based on efficient self-assembly and chemical modification of nucleic acid,\" said Wu Xiaohui from NCNST, first author of the paper.The complementary sense and antisense strands of gene can be directly folded into two DNA origami monomers by their corresponding staple strands. After hybridization, the researchers fabricated genetically encoded DNA origami with precisely organized lipids on the surface for in-situ lipid growth.After decoration with the tumor-targeting group, the antitumor gene (p53) encoded and lipid-coated DNA origami can elicit a pronounced upregulation of the p53 protein in tumor cells to achieve efficient tumor therapy in vivo.\"The genes folded and delivered by this method are not limited in length as viral vectors, and due to the presence of DNA origami templates, there are more options for lipid components, without being restricted by the composition and concentration formula of traditional liposomes,\" said Ding from NCNST, one of the paper's corresponding authors.

  "text": "A new type of aromatic nanobelt, methylene-bridged [n]cycloparaphenylene ([n]MCPP), has been synthesized and its properties elucidated by researchers at the Institute of Transformative Bio-molecules (WPI-ITbM) at Nagoya University in Japan, in collaboration with researchers at the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Salerno in Italy and the University of Nevada in the U.S.          The production of cyclic molecular nanocarbons such as carbon nanorings (CNRs) and carbon nanobelts (CNBs) is an emerging topic in chemistry. [n]Cycloparaphenylene ([n]CPP) was the first CNR and has dominated the chemistry of cyclic molecular nanocarbons in the last decade. CPPs exhibit unique size-dependent properties in their strain energies, dihedral angles between adjacent phenylene units, highest occupied molecular orbital\u2014lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gap, maximum fluorescence wavelength, fluorescence quantum efficiency, and guest-encapsulating properties. Compared to CNRs, CNBs with fused benzene rings have more rigid cyclic structures with significantly higher strain energy.Now, a team led by Professor Kenichiro Itami (he/him) and Designated Associate Professor Akiko Yagi (she/her) of ITbM, Nagoya University, has synthesized methylene-bridged [n]cycloparapenylenes ([n]MCPPs, n = 6, 8, 10); nanobelts containing five-membered benzene rings bridged by methylene units. The key to successful synthesis is the use of pillar[n]arenes, which are commercially available cyclic aromatic molecules, as precursors to construct the nanobelt structure through an intramolecular coupling reaction.Investigation revealed that MCPPs exhibit different properties depending on their ring size. As ring size increases, visible UV light is absorbed at longer wavelengths. This is in contrast to CPPs, whose spectra are independent of ring size. [6]MCPP shows almost no fluorescence, [8]MCPP fluoresces orange and [10]MCPP fluoresces yellow-green. The fluorescence values are very high for carbon nanobelts, suggesting that large ringed MCPPs could be used as fluorescent nanobelts, something that has never been seen before.Previous theoretical studies have predicted that [6]MCPP exhibits a strong \"paratropic belt current\" throughout the molecule. In collaboration with research groups in Italy and the U.S., the ITbM research group clarified that the paratropic belt current throughout the MCPP decreases as the ring size increases using both computational and experimental studies. This property was first elucidated by the synthesis of [8]MCPP and [10]MCPP, and this discovery has significant implications for the study of the magnetic properties of aromatic nanobelts. The team plans to continue the synthesis of other sizes of MCPPs to open up a new field of nanobelt science.The research is published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.

  "text": "MIT engineers have designed a new nanoparticle sensor that could enable early diagnosis of cancer with a simple urine test. The sensors, which can detect many different cancerous proteins, could also be used to distinguish the type of a tumor or how it is responding to treatment.          The nanoparticles are designed so that when they encounter a tumor, they shed short sequences of DNA that are excreted in the urine. Analyzing these DNA \"barcodes\" can reveal distinguishing features of a particular patient's tumor. The researchers designed their test so that it can be performed using a strip of paper, similar to an at-home COVID test, which they hope could make it affordable and accessible to as many patients as possible.\"We are trying to innovate in a context of making technology available to low- and middle-resource settings. Putting this diagnostic on paper is part of our goal of democratizing diagnostics and creating inexpensive technologies that can give you a fast answer at the point of care,\" says Sangeeta Bhatia, the John and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT and a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and Institute for Medical Engineering and Science.In tests in mice, the researchers showed that they could use the sensors to detect the activity of five different enzymes that are expressed in tumors. They also showed that their approach could be scaled up to distinguish at least 46 different DNA barcodes in a single sample, using a microfluidic device to analyze the samples.Bhatia is the senior author of the paper, which appears today in Nature Nanotechnology. Liangliang Hao, a former MIT research scientist who is now an assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Boston University, is the lead author of the study.DNA barcodesFor several years, Bhatia's lab has been developing \"synthetic biomarkers\" that could be used to diagnose cancer. This work builds on the concept of detecting cancer biomarkers, such as proteins or circulating tumor cells, in a patient's blood sample. These naturally occurring biomarkers are so rare that it's nearly impossible to find them, especially at an early stage, but synthetic biomarkers can be used amplify smaller-scale changes that occur within small tumors.In previous work, Bhatia created nanoparticles that can detect the activity of enzymes called proteases, which help cancer cells to escape their original locations, or settle into new ones, by cutting through proteins of the extracellular matrix. The nanoparticles are coated with peptides that are cleaved by different proteases, and once these peptides are released into the bloodstream, they can then be concentrated and more easily detected in a urine sample.The original peptide biomarkers were designed to be detected based on small engineered variations in their mass, using a mass spectrometer. This kind of equipment might not be available in low-resource settings, so the researchers set out to develop sensors that could be analyzed more easily and affordably, using DNA barcodes that can be read using CRISPR technology.For this approach to work, the researchers had to use a chemical modification called phosphorothioate to protect the circulating DNA reporter barcodes from being broken down in the blood. This modification has already been used to improve the stability of modern RNA vaccines, allowing them to survive longer in the body.Similar to the peptide reporters, each DNA barcode is attached to a nanoparticle by a linker that can be cleaved by a specific protease. If that protease is present, the DNA molecule is released and free to circulate, eventually ending up in the urine. For this study, the researchers used two different types of nanoparticles: one, a particle made from polymers that have been FDA-approved for use in humans, and the other a \"nanobody\"\u2014an antibody fragment that can be designed to accumulate at a tumor site.Once the sensors are secreted in the urine, the sample can be analyzed using a paper strip that recognizes a reporter that is activated by a CRISPR enzyme called Cas12a. When a particular DNA barcode is present in the sample, Cas12a amplifies the signal so that it can be seen as a dark strip on a paper test.The particles can be designed to carry many different DNA barcodes, each of which detects a different type of protease activity, which allows for \"multiplexed\" sensing. Using a larger number of sensors provides a boost in both sensitivity and specificity, allowing the test to more easily distinguish between tumor types.      Disease signaturesIn tests in mice, the researchers showed that a panel of five DNA barcodes could accurately distinguish tumors that first arose in the lungs from tumors formed by colorectal cancer cells that had metastasized to the lungs.\"Our goal here is to build up disease signatures and to see whether we can use these barcoded panels not only read out a disease but also to classify a disease or distinguish different cancer types,\" Hao says.For use in humans, the researchers expect that they may need to use more than five barcodes because there is so much variety between patients' tumors. To help reach that goal, they worked with researchers at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard led by Harvard University Professor Pardis Sabeti, to create a microfluidic chip that can be used to read up to 46 different DNA barcodes from one sample.This kind of testing could be used not only for detecting cancer, but also for measuring how well a patient's tumor responds to treatment and whether it has recurred after treatment. The researchers are now working on further developing the particles with the goal of testing them in humans. Glympse Bio, a company co-founded by Bhatia, has performed phase 1 clinical trials of an earlier version of the urinary diagnostic particles and found them to be safe in patients.

  "answer_squad": " Nature Reviews Materials",
  "text": "Today, electronic and photonic devices are ubiquitous in smart phones, computers, light sources, sensors, and communications. To underpin the demand for optoelectronic applications, functional materials are essential. For instance, silicon is required for logic computing and photonic integrated circuits (PIC); group III-V semiconductors (such as GaAs, InP, AlN, etc.) are used for optoelectronic, light-emitting and photodetection applications; and piezoelectric materials are used for actuators and sensors.          However, the development of multifunctional and versatile photonic and optoelectronic systems would benefit from the realization of all the required functionalities using a single material platform. A heterogeneous integration platform has thus attracted tremendous interest from both academia and industry. Our research group (lead by Prof. Sang-Hoon Bae from Washington University in St. Louis, WUSTL) sought to address this need by using an advanced material epitaxy and layer transfer technique for novel optoelectronic applications.The heterogeneous integration of functional materials and optical structures is essential for building high-performance integrated optoelectronic systems and an ideal platform for investigating nanophotonic phenomena. Conventional approaches to this rely on heteroepitaxy and require lattice-matching and process compatibility constraints. When the lattice constant differs more than a few percentage points between the epilayer and substrate, the grown films can be deteriorated by the polycrystalline phase or only epitaxial islands are formed, greatly degrading the intrinsic performance of the optical materials.However, van der Waals (vdW) integration, leveraging isolated freestanding building blocks, is free of the lattice-matching constraints that apply in epitaxy. This low-energy physical assembly method was originally applied in two-dimensional materials due to its high flexibility in constructing vdW heterostructures (see figure above). Recent advances in advanced 2D-materials\u2013assisted epitaxy and layer lift-off technologies have provided photonic engineers with many single-crystalline three-dimensional (3D) nanomembranes that can also be made to be ultrathin, flexible, and freestanding, like 2D materials. There has thus been exciting recent progress in optical and optoelectronic applications through photonic vdW integration.In our recent paper published in Nature Reviews Materials, we presented a comprehensive catalog on the latest progress on photonic vdW integration from 2D materials to 3D nanomembranes, along with Prof. Cheng-Wei Qiu (National University of Singapore), Prof. Lan Yang (WUSTL), Prof. Jin-Wook Lee (Sungkyunkwan University), Prof. Yang Yang (University of California, Los Angeles) and other international collaborators. In addition to 2D materials, we also summarized currently available 3D freestanding nanomembranes. Detailed guidelines from thin film preparations to device implementations are outlined as well.As the available material library of functional 3D nanomembranes is much wider than that of 2D materials, we thus envision emerging opportunities of van der Waals integration beyond 2D materials: High-quality, 3D thin films with exemplary functionalities such as optical gain, piezoelectric, electro-optical, and magneto-optical materials, etc., can be transferred to photonic structures to prototype novel devices and applications.In this paper, we have also outlined promising opportunities for mixed-dimensional vdW heterostructures, advanced high-performance photonic devices based on novel hetero-integration layouts, and flexible and bio-compatible optoelectronic applications based on current perspectives. We also reviewed key technological challenges such as scalable nanomembranes manufacture and transfer for the field of thin-film photonics and photonic vdW integration.This story is part of Science X Dialog, where researchers can report findings from their published research articles.

Although nanozymes with oxidase mimic activity have shown promise for biomarker sensing, their lower activity compared to natural enzymes has constrained their wider application.In this research, the team identified that MnOx NBs with an ultrathin layered structure improve catalytic active site exposure and the negative charge layer of birnessite-type MnOx NBs enhances affinity for positive substrates such as 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB).Significantly, oxygen vacancies created via laser irradiation reduced the adsorption energy of the MnOx NBs for oxygen, resulting in excellent substrate affinity (Km = 0.0087 mM) and high catalytic rate (Vmax = 6.04 \u00d7 10-7 M/s).Furthermore, glutathione (GSH) inhibition of nanozymes with oxidase (OXD) mimics was exploited in the establishment of a fast and highly sensitive method for GSH determination.These findings may provide new strategies for synthesizing highly active nanozymes for biomarker applications.

  "text": "A research team led by Prof. Yang Liangbao from Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences found that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) could effectively block electron tunneling and extend the ultimate plasmonic enhancement limits in a single-atom-layer gap, providing deep insights into quantum mechanical effects in plasmonic systems and enabling potential novel applications based on quantum plasmonics. The results were published in Nano Letters.       The team have been working on developing surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) detection methods for years and found that the near-field intensity distribution in the nanometer scale is uneven. To achieve greater electromagnetic enhancement, they used adjacent metal nano-gaps but noticed that reducing their size leads to the emergence of quantum tunneling effect, making it disadvantageous for SERS detection.To overcome this, the team introduced a high tunneling barrier formed by monolayer h-BN, actively blocking the electron tunneling effect. They quantitatively detected the final near-field enhancement limit in the classical framework by detecting the intrinsic SERS intensity of h-BN in a single particle cavity.The study proved that monolayer h-BN blocks the electron tunneling using hot electron tunneling quantum computation and layer-dependent scattering spectrum experiments. By comparing the experimental results with the calculated results of the classical electromagnetic model and the quantum correction model, the team realized the final near-field enhancement limit detection within the classical framework.This work provides important guidance for quantum plasmology and nano-gap photodynamics, helping to further analyze quantum mechanical effects in plasma enhancement.

  "answer_squad": " Bradley Olsen",
  "text": "MIT engineers have designed a two-component system that can be injected into the body and help form blood clots at the sites of internal injury. These materials, which mimic the way that the body naturally forms clots, could offer a way to keep people with severe internal injuries alive until they can reach a hospital.          In a mouse model of internal injury, the researchers showed that these components\u2014a nanoparticle and a polymer\u2014performed significantly better than hemostatic nanoparticles that were developed earlier.\"What was especially remarkable about these results was the level of recovery from severe injury we saw in the animal studies. By introducing two complementary systems in sequence it is possible to get a much stronger clot,\" says Paula Hammond, an MIT Institute Professor, the head of MIT's Department of Chemical Engineering, a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, and one of the senior authors of a paper on the study.Unlike previously developed hemostatic systems, the new MIT technology mimics the actions of both platelets\u2014the cells that initiate blood clotting\u2014and fibrinogen, a protein that helps forms clots.\"The idea of using two components allows selective gelation of the hemostatic system as the concentration is enhanced in the wound, mimicking the end effect of the natural clotting cascade,\" says Bradley Olsen, the Alexander and I. Michael Kasser Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT and a senior author of the study.MIT postdoc Celestine Hong Ph.D. '22 is the lead author of the paper, which is published in Advanced Healthcare Materials. Other authors of the paper include postdoc Yanpu He, undergraduate student Porter Bowen, and Professor Angela Belcher, who is head of MIT's Department of Biological Engineering.Artificial clottingBlood loss from traumatic events such as car crashes contributes to more than 2.5 million deaths per year worldwide. This kind of blunt trauma can cause internal bleeding from organs such as the liver, which is difficult to detect and treat. In such cases, it's critical to stop the bleeding as soon as possible, until a patient can be transported to the hospital for further treatment. Finding ways to prevent internal bleeding could have an especially significant impact in the armed services, where delayed treatment for internal hemorrhage is one of the largest causes of preventable death, Olsen says.When internal injuries occur, platelets are attracted to the site and initiate the blood clotting cascade, which eventually forms a sticky plug of platelets and clotting proteins, including fibrinogen. However, if patients are losing a lot of blood, they don't have enough platelets or fibrinogen to form clots. The MIT team wanted to create an artificial system that could help save people's lives by replacing both of those clotting components.\"What researchers in this area have been doing in the past is trying to either recapture the therapeutic effects of platelets or recapture the function of fibrinogen,\" Hong says. \"What we are trying to do in this project is to capture the way they interact with each other.\"To achieve that, the researchers created a system with two types of materials: a nanoparticle that recruits platelets and a polymer that mimics fibrinogen.For the platelet-recruiting particles, the researchers used particles similar to those they reported in a 2022 study. These particles are made of a biocompatible polymer called PEG-PLGA, which are functionalized with a peptide called GRGDS that allows them to bind to activated platelets. Because platelets are drawn to the site of an injury, these particles also tend to accumulate at injury sites.In that 2022 study, the researchers found that when these targeting particles were in an optimal size range of 140 to 220 nanometers, they would build up at a wound site but not accumulate significantly in organs such as the lungs, where clot formation would be risky to the patient.For this paper, the researchers modified those particles by adding a chemical group that would react with a tag placed on the second component in the system, which they call the crosslinker. Those crosslinkers, made of either PEG or PEG-PLGA, bind to the targeting particles that have accumulated at a wound site and form clumps that mimic blood clots.\"The idea is that with both of these components circulating inside the bloodstream, if there is a wound site, the targeting component will start accumulating at the wound site and also bind the crosslinker,\" Hong says. \"When both components are at high concentration, you get more cross-linking, and they begin forming that glue and helping the clotting process.\"      Stopping the bleedingTo test the system, the researchers used a mouse model of internal injury. They found that after being injected into the body, the two-component system was highly effective at stopping bleeding, and it worked about twice as well as the targeting particle on its own.Another important advantage of the clots is that they don't degrade as fast as naturally occurring clots do. When patients lose a lot of blood, they are usually given saline intravenously to keep up their blood pressure, but this saline also dilutes the existing platelets and fibrinogen, leading to weaker clots and faster degradation. However, the artificial clots are not as susceptible to this kind of degradation, the researchers found.The researchers also found that their nanoparticles did not induce any significant immune reaction in the mice compared to a glucose control. They now plan to test the system in a larger animal model, working with researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital.In the longer term, the researchers also hope to explore the possibility of using portable imaging devices to visualize the injected nanoparticles after they have entered the body. This could help doctors or emergency medical responders quickly determine the site of internal bleeding, which currently can only be done at a hospital with MRI, ultrasound, or surgery.\"There can be hours of delay in figuring out where the source of the bleeding is, and that requires a lot of steps before the bleeding site can be treated. So, being able to combine this system with diagnostic tools is one area that we're interested in,\" Hong says.

  "text": "Cancer is a complex systemic disease, with accompanying secondary effects that can result in debilitating effects on the human body. Cancer-associated skeletal muscle weakening or loss, also called \"cancer cachexia,\" is a prevalent and serious condition responsible for 20%\u201330% of the deaths in affected cancer patients. In current treatments for cancer cachexia, there are limitations in efficacy levels and significant side effects.          A new study led by researchers at the Institute for Digital Medicine (WisDM) and the Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS Medicine), in collaboration with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), and City University of Hong Kong (CityU), examined a new gene therapy strategy for reversing cancer cachexia. The team used nano-sized particles released by red blood cells, termed \"red blood cell-derived extracellular vesicles\" (RBCEVs), to package and transport RNA-based drug molecules to muscle cells in the body.Published in Molecular Therapy, the study found that drug-loaded RBCEVs inhibited target genes could increase muscle growth and suppress cancer cachexia. Compared to the delivery of a single RNA drug, muscle growth was observed to be further enhanced when two RNA drugs targeting two different genes implicated in cancer cachexia were loaded into the same RBCEVs. Importantly, repeated administrations with RBCEVs did not induce toxicity or inflammatory reactions, which is a prerequisite for clinical trials on humans.\"There is a lot of potential in using RNA-based drugs for conditions that are difficult to treat, but the delivery has always been tricky. From our previous and current studies, we have found that the RBCEV delivery platform can help to overcome some of the long-standing technical challenges in the field,\" said Assistant Professor Minh Le from WisDM and the Department of Pharmacology at NUS Medicine, who led the study.

This could lead to the use EV-based gene therapies to address unmet needs in cachexia and sarcopenia.\"The team has plans for further collaborations to test the use of RBCEV-delivered therapeutics against other targets in the muscles. At the same time, they have been working on applying RBCEVs to the treatment of different cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and COVID-19. Accumulating data from their studies, the RBCEV has shown to be a robust, safe and versatile platform.As the collective understanding of RBCEV biology and related technologies continue to mature, the RBCEV platform is well-positioned for clinical translation to provide safer and more efficacious treatment options for muscle degenerative conditions as well as other challenging diseases.

The research, published in the journal ACS Nano under the title \"Targeted Discovery of Low-Coordinated Crystal Structures via Tunable Particle Interactions,\" is authored by Ph.D. student Hillary Pan and her advisor Julia Dshemuchadse, assistant professor of materials science and engineering.\"Essentially we were trying to figure out what kinds of new crystal structure configurations we can self-assemble in simulation,\" Pan said. \"The most exciting thing was that we found new structures that weren't previously listed in any crystal structure database; these particles are actually assembling into something that nobody had ever seen before.\"The team conducted a targeted search for previously unknown low-coordinated assemblies within a vast parameter space spanned by particles interacting via isotropic pair potentials, the paper states. \"Low-coordinated structures have anisotropic local environments, meaning that the geometries are highly directional, so it's incredible that we're able to see such a variety of these types of structures using purely non-directional interactions,\" said Pan.Low particle coordination is a structural characteristic key to the functional properties of many technologically important materials including framework structures such as metal-organic frameworks, clathrates, and zeolites as well as photonic crystals such as diamond.The researchers developed a new functional form for particle interactions in which all features can be tuned independently. By systematically changing pairs of parameters in simulation, the researchers were able to control various features of the particles' interaction landscape. Despite limiting the search to a small region of the vast parameter space of possible particle interactions, the paper states, a wealth of complexity and symmetry is apparent within these crystal structures, which include clathrates with empty cages and low-symmetry structures, which had also not been observed previously in simulation.The work demonstrates that complicated structures can develop from simple interactions and adds new theoretical structures for others working in the field. The team's flexible and intuitive interaction potential design serves as an important step towards determining the characteristics of particle interactions that lead to certain structural properties, useful for establishing synthetic rules to make target structures.The team's findings suggest that there are potentially limitless new and exotic materials configurations possible through controlled self-assembly. \"This is the first time that we're quantifying the relationship of this isotropic pair potential with the crystal structures that result,\" Dshemuchadse said. \"These new crystal structures can now serve as design targets for researchers who actually make nanoparticles and colloids.\" More information:Hillary Pan et al, Targeted Discovery of Low-Coordinated Crystal Structures via Tunable Particle Interactions, ACS Nano (2023).

  "text": "Craft brewers are continuously upping the ante and coming up with innovative ways to make or flavor their newest beers. Now, researchers are adding a new twist of their own, speeding up the brewing process with beer-making mini-robots or \"BeerBots.\" Reporting in ACS Nano, the team shows that these self-propelled, magnetic packages of yeast can make the fermentation phase go faster and cut out the need to filter the beverage.       Beer, one of the world's most-consumed drinks, can take a while to brew. In the first step, sugars are extracted from grains, such as malted barley, to create a watery solution called wort. Next, yeasts ferment those sugars, converting them into alcohol, carbon dioxide gas and new flavor compounds. This step can take as long as four weeks, and during that time, unwanted microorganisms can get in and spoil the final product with sour flavors.Previous researchers have suggested that encapsulating the yeast in polymer capsules could lessen the chance of spoilage by speeding up the process. So, Martin Pumera and colleagues wanted to develop a self-propelled bot to both make fermentation proceed more quickly and simplify the separation of yeast from the final beer.

Credit: ACS Nano (2023). DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.2c12677             The researchers made 2-mm-wide BeerBot capsules by combining active yeast, magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and sodium alginate from algae and dripping the mixture into a ferric chloride solution. Then they made one side of the spheres porous by exposing that half to an alkaline solution in an electrochemical cell.Initial experiments showed that the yeast-containing beads could ferment sugar and produce carbon dioxide bubbles that propelled them upward. When they got to the surface, they released carbon dioxide into the air, and then sank again, resulting in a bobbing motion.When the capsules were used to ferment malted barley wort, the team found that the self-propelled BeerBots transformed sugars faster than free yeast cells. As the sugar was used up and fermentation ceased, the yeast-containing capsules sank to the bottom of the flask. This made it easy to separate the yeast from the final product with a magnet, rather than with a filtration step that is currently required to remove free yeast cells.Additionally, the collected BeerBots were active for up to three more wort fermentation cycles. Based on these results, the researchers say that BeerBots could produce tasty brews faster.

  "question_race": " What is the author's attitude towards the general theory of bilayer stacking ferroelectricity?",
  "answer_race": " Objective.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the two-dimensional ferroelectrics?",
  "answer_squad": " BSF",
  "text": "Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics, planar materials that have a spontaneous and reversible electric polarization, are extremely rare and yet could be extremely advantageous for the development of new nanoelectronics. Due to their ferroelectric properties and thin nature, they could be used to create high-performing, small and flexible devices, including high-density non-volatile memory, optoelectronics, ultra-low energy electronics and wearable technologies.          A research group at Fudan University and the Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute proposed a theory of bilayer stacking ferroelectricity (BSF), in which two stacked layers of the same 2D material, with different rotation and translation, exhibit ferroelectricity. This theory, presented in Physical Review Letters, could inform the synthesis of these advantageous materials and offer a generalizable guideline of how two stacked layers of the same 2D material can be engineered to exhibit ferroelectricity.\"A promising strategy in designing 2D ferroelectrics is the sliding ferroelectricity, which combines two monolayers of the same type and generates polarization by tuning the amount of their relative sliding,\" Changsong Xu and Hongjun Xiang who supervised the study, told Phys.org.\"However, studies adopting such concept still stay at the stage of examining materials one by one, which largely hinders the progress of this field. We thus come up with the idea to explore all the possibilities of bilayer stacking ferroelectricity with group theory, so that researchers can easily tell the polarization direction of a bilayer from the symmetry of corresponding monolayer.\"To devise their general theory of bilayer stacking ferroelectricity, they systematically analyzed a series of 2D material groups using so-called group theory, an abstract algebra theory for studying sets of specific objects. This allowed them to pinpoint the rules underpinning the creation and annihilation of symmetries in bilayer structures, while also identifying possible combinations that would produce BSF.\"Materials usually crystalize in specific symmetries, such as mirror plane and rotational axis, which can be used to categorize the materials,\" Xu and Xiang explained. \"For monolayers, it is the layer groups (there are 80 of them) that cover all the types of materials. Our general theory applies when one wants to stack two monolayers into a bilayer and check if there exists electric polarization.\"The researchers' theory explains recent theoretical and experimental findings on sliding ferroelectricity. It also shows that in 2D ferroelectrics, the direction of the electric polarization of the bilayer could be totally different from that of the single layer. For instance, a bilayer could become ferroelectric if two centrosymmetric nonpolar monolayers are properly stacked.      \"We obtain general rules of the destruction of original symmetry operations of the monolayer and emergence of new symmetry operations in the bilayer,\" Xu and Xiang said. \"Our general theory of bilayer stacking ferroelectricity covers all the possibilities of bilayer ferroelectricity. With such theory, given the layer group of any monolayer, one can tell what kind of stacking operations will result in ferroelectricity in the corresponding bilayer and along which direction the ferroelectric polarization points.\"To demonstrate the effectiveness of their general theory, the researchers ran a series of simulations. These simulations predicted that ferroelectricity could be introduced in the prototypical 2D ferromagnetic centrosymmetric material CrI3 using a stacking strategy.They also showed that the out-of-plane electric polarization in this bilayer system is interlocked with the in-plane electric polarization. In other words, the out-of-plane polarization of the stacked CrI3 bilayer system could be manipulated by applying an in-plane electric field to it.The general theory of bilayer stacking ferroelectricity introduced by Xu, Xiang and their colleagues could soon guide new studies aimed at creating bilayer ferroelectrics. This could in turn facilitate the development of new highly performing devices based on these promising 2D material systems.\"On one hand, the proposed general theory indicates many possibilities to create bilayer ferroelectricity and it thus will be appealing to apply such theory to various 2D systems,\" Xu and Xiang added. \"On the other hand, the successful application of group theory method to 2D ferroelectricity encourages us to use it for predicting other fascinating physical properties.\" More information:Junyi Ji et al, General Theory for Bilayer Stacking Ferroelectricity, Physical Review Letters (2023).

  "answer_squad": " CVD",
  "text": "Scientists from Tokyo Metropolitan University have successfully engineered multi-layered nanostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides that meet in-plane to form junctions. They grew out layers of multi-layered structures of molybdenum disulfide from the edge of niobium doped molybdenum disulfide shards, creating a thick, bonded, planar heterostructure. They demonstrated that these may be used to make new tunnel field-effect transistors (TFET), components in integrated circuits with ultra-low power consumption.          Field-effect transistors (FETs) are a crucial building block of nearly every digital circuit. They control the passage of current through it depending on the voltage which is put across. While metal oxide semiconductor FETs (or MOSFETs) form the majority of FETs in use today, the search is on for the next generation of materials to drive increasingly demanding and compact devices using less power.This is where tunneling FETs (or TFETs) come in. TFETs rely on quantum tunneling, an effect where electrons are able to pass usually impassable barriers due to quantum mechanical effects. Though TFETs use much less energy and have long been proposed as a promising alternative to traditional FETs, scientists are yet to come up with a way of implementing the technology in a scalable form.A team of scientists of Tokyo Metropolitan University led by Associate Professor Yasumitsu Miyata has been working on making nanostructures out of transition metal dichalcogenides, a mixture of transition metals and group 16 elements. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs, two chalcogen atoms to one metal atom) are excellent candidate materials for creating TFETs. Their recent successes have allowed them to stitch together single-atom thick layers of crystalline TMDC sheets over unprecedented lengths.Now, they have turned their attention to multi-layered structures of TMDCs. By using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique, they showed that they could grow out a different TMDC from the edge of stacked crystalline planes mounted on a substrate. The result was an in-plane junction that was multiple-layers thick. Much of the existing work on TMDC junctions use monolayers stacked on top of each other; this is because, despite the superb theoretical performance of in-plane junctions, previous attempts could not realize the high hole and electron concentrations required to make a TFET work.

Credit: Tokyo Metropolitan University             After demonstrating the robustness of their technique using molybdenum disulfide grown from tungsten diselenide, they turned their attention to niobium doped molybdenum disulfide, a p-type semiconductor. By growing out multi-layered structures of undoped molybdenum disulfide, an n-type semiconductor, the team realized a thick p-n junction between TMDCs with unprecedentedly high carrier concentration. Furthermore, they found that the junction showed a trend of negative differential resistance (NDR), where increases in voltage lead to less and less increased current, a key feature of tunneling and a significant first step for these nanomaterials to make their way into TFETs.The research is published in the journal ACS Nano.The method employed by the team is also scalable over large areas, making it suitable for implementation during circuit fabrication. This is an exciting new development for modern electronics, with hopes that it will find its way into applications in the future.

  "text": "A research group led by Prof. Wang Liping at the Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering (NIMTE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), in collaboration with Prof. Li Qunyang at Tsinghua University, developed a universal superlattice film that can be applied to mechanical parts to achieve long-term macroscale superlubricity with self-rejuvenation. The study was published in Cell Reports Physical Science.          It is estimated that about one-third of global energy is consumed to get rid of friction, which is quite common in nature. Reducing friction to an ultra-low level or even a superlubricious state with a friction coefficient on the order of 10-3 can exert significant impacts on human life. However, achieving robust macroscale superlubricity between dry solid surfaces remains a challenge, which has been realized mainly at nanometer scales with lamellar materials in previous studies.To tackle this challenge, the researchers designed a universal molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) /ceramic superlattice architecture, which enables long-term (close to 300,000 sliding cycles) macroscale superlubricity in mild vacuum after a short running-in period in air.The precise thickness control of each individual sublayer within the bilayer unit endows the film with such excellent superlubricity (friction coefficient of 0.006). More interestingly, the lubrication capability can be rejuvenated when the film is accidentally exposed to air.The superlubricious interface is believed to result from the sliding of MoS2-wrapped metal oxides (MeOx) nanoparticles sandwiched between highly ordered MoS2 flakes, dividing the macroscopic contact area into numerous incommensurate nanocontact zones to ensure robust superlubricity.Benefiting from the robust superlubricity, the specific wear rate of the superlattice film was reduced to an ultralow level on the order of 10-9 mm3 N-1 m-1.These findings offer a novel strategy for designing versatile solid lubricants, which may contribute to revolutionary applications both on the ground and in space.

They are a promising source of biomarkers for liquid biopsies for early cancer diagnosis and real-time monitoring of tumor development. However, analysis of nanosized EVs in blood samples has been hampered by the lack of effective, rapid, and standardized methods to isolate and purify EVs.          In a study published in Science Advances, Sun Jiashu's group from the National Center for Nanoscience and Technology (NCNST) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and collaborators from the Fifth Medical Center of the Chinese PLA General Hospital have devised cascaded microfluidic circuits comprising a cell-removal circuit and an EV-isolation circuit to achieve pulsatile filtration of EVs directly from whole blood samples in a rapid, high-yield, and high-purity manner.\"The key design of the cascaded microfluidic circuits is based on an electric-hydraulic analogy,\" said Li Zhenglin from NCNST, first author of the paper.By mimicking the function of electric circuits, the researchers fabricated microfluidic circuits with an elastomeric membrane (fluidic capacitor), check valve (diode), and microchannels (resistors); thus, the microfluidic circuits could generate pulsatile flows under pulsatile pressure without requiring complex control systems.Through integration with a polycarbonate membrane filter (pore size of 600 nm, for plasma extraction) and an anodic aluminum oxide membrane filter (pore size of 20 nm, for EV purification), these cascaded microfluidic circuits successfully isolated and purified EVs directly from blood samples within 30 minutes, which is superior to the ultracentrifugation method and dead-end filtration method.The clinical potential of isolated EVs was further explored with a one-step polyethylene glycol-enhanced thermophoretic aptasensor. By detecting the expression levels of epithelial cellular adhesion molecules on EVs, precise discrimination between nonmetastatic breast cancer patients and healthy donors was achieved, with an overall accuracy of 91%.\"The cascaded microfluidic circuits display efficient and robust isolation of EVs without the requirement of complex external equipment, and will have a distinct improvement in the field of microfluidic membrane filtration,\" said Sun Jiashu from NCNST, one of the paper's corresponding authors.

And now for the first time, research conducted at MedUni Vienna has shown how these minute particles manage to breach the blood-brain barrier and as a consequence penetrate the brain. The newly discovered mechanism provides the basis for further research to protect humans and the environment.          Published in the journal Nanomaterials, the study was carried out in an animal model with oral administration of MNPs, in this case polystyrene, a widely-used plastic which is also found in food packaging. Led by Lukas Kenner (Department of Pathology at MedUni Vienna and Department of Laboratory Animal Pathology at Vetmeduni) and Oldamur Holl\u00f3czki (Department of Physical Chemistry, University of Debrecen, Hungary) the research team was able to determine that tiny polystyrene particles could be detected in the brain just two hours after ingestion.The mechanism that enabled them to breach the blood-brain barrier was previously unknown to medical science. \"With the help of computer models, we discovered that a certain surface structure (biomolecular corona) was crucial in enabling plastic particles to pass into the brain,\" Oldamur Holl\u00f3czki explained.Researching impact on healthThe blood-brain barrier is an important cellular barrier that prevents pathogens or toxins from reaching the brain. The intestine has a similar protective wall (intestinal barrier), which can also be breached by MNPs, as various scientific studies have demonstrated. Intensive research is being conducted on the health effects of plastic particles in the body. MNPs in the gastrointestinal tract have already been linked with local inflammatory and immune reactions, and the development of cancer.\"In the brain, plastic particles could increase the risk of inflammation, neurological disorders or even neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's,\" said Lukas Kenner, pointing out that more research is needed in this area.Restrict the use of MNPsNanoplastics are defined as having a size of less than 0.001 millimeters, while at 0.001 to 5 millimeters, some microplastics are still visible to the naked eye. MNPs enter the food chain through various sources including packaging waste.But it is not just solid food that plays a role, but liquids too: according to one study, anyone who drinks the recommended 1.5-2 liters of water per day from plastic bottles will end up ingesting around 90,000 plastic particles a year in the process. However, drinking tap water instead can\u2014depending on the geographical location\u2014help reduce this figure to 40,000.\"To minimize the potential harm of micro- and nanoplastic particles to humans and the environment, it is crucial to limit exposure and restrict their use while further research is carried out into the effects of MNPs,\" Lukas Kenner explained.

  "text": "Finding a 3D printable ink that conducts electricity, yet is strong, flexible and stretchable, has been a goal of materials scientists around the world since 3D printing began, says Daeha Joung, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the Department of Physics at Virginia Commonwealth University's College of Humanities and Sciences.          So last year, when Andy Shar came into his lab eager to look for the solution, Joung was apprehensive but gave Shar a chance. And he is grateful he did.\"I was trying to find that ink myself,\" Joung said. \"But somehow, Andy discovered the recipe.\"The discovery has opened up new opportunities for Shar, now a sophomore majoring in biology in the College of Humanities and Sciences and minoring in religious studies in the School of World Studies. He has been working with Joung and his research team through the VCU Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program.Alongside Phillip Glass, a student in the Ph.D. in nanoscience and nanotechnology program, Shar has published two academic papers, including one in the journal Advanced Functional Materials for which he served as the first author. He also has submitted another\u2014plus a book chapter\u2014and has been invited to present at conferences about the discovery.\"The material we discovered was a composite of silicone\u2014polydimethylsiloxine, or PDMS\u2014and we dispersed carbon nanotubes, or CNT, inside of that silicone, which is something that is kind of difficult to do,\" Shar said. \"We used a pretty simple environmentally friendly technique to do it that can occur at room temperature. The fabrication process being easy allows it to be accessible to other people and maybe even companies who want to use it commercially.\"Joung, Shar and Glass continue to use the 3D printable ink in the development of customizable patient health monitoring devices and of electronic skin, or eSkin\u2014wearable sensors to detect motion of joints or monitor cardiac and respiratory health.\"What Dr. Joung has been really pioneering is using 3D printing to create scaffolds that can simulate the spinal cord architecture,\" Shar said. He and Joung hope this technology, infused with bioprinted information that would allow cells to regrow, can help people with spinal cord injuries regain sensory and motor function.Here, student and mentor share thoughts on what they learned working together.      Andy SharWhat attracted you to this project?I'll start from the beginning and go to what attracted me to Dr. Joung's lab in the first place: [my] past experience with high school research. I've always really liked hands-on stuff, and materials science and nanotechnology were two of my main interests coming into VCU. So I liked how he incorporated that with 3D printing\u2014which was something I've never done before but was also excited to use\u2014with biological applications. I intend to go into the medical field, so that would be something that would relate to my future profession. So that was definitely something of interest.For that specific project, I actually started by working with Phillip Glass, who's a physics graduate student, on his project, and it just became a natural progression because I was helping him. I had some interest in chemistry and the process of making the ink and making the material. And as I was helping him, I decided to do my own trials. And I really credit Dr. Joung for giving me the flexibility and independence to do that. I was experimenting around, and once I found an ink that I thought would work, then we decided that if it was unique enough and if it had certain advantages over what was seen in the literature, then we could write a paper about it. So I did more research there.What did you get out of the experience?There were a few things I got out of it. Definitely knowledge, learning about the materials science aspect of it, a lot of lessons in perseverance. It took dozens of trials\u2014Dr. Joung has seen my array of vials with hundreds of failed attempts. So just being able to learn from your past mistakes. And I didn't give up, because I knew I was getting closer and closer to the end result.That was really a lesson that I learned, and I also think teamwork. As a group, we held meetings where we presented our findings, so you learn communication skills, how to interact with the group, how to just work with different (technologies)\u2014how to use the gantry, how to use the texture analyzer, different machines\u2014and then spreading that knowledge as well, and teaching other people who join the lab how to use those same machines.And then, because of the project, I've also been able to present at multiple conferences\u2014for example, the UROP Symposium, which I will be presenting at this spring, and the annual Network for Undergraduate Research in Virginia conference at Christopher Newport University, which was in January. Being able to present to the public and explain to them our findings in terms that they can understand is definitely a skill that I've learned.What's one lesson you learned from Dr. Joung?From Dr. Joung, I've learned really just how to be an effective PI [principal investigator]. It's about the coordination of an effective team and really encouraging teamwork and making sure everybody's staying involved, everybody is going at a pace that's comfortable for them but also making sure to push them a little bit. I remember Dr. Joung helping me out whenever I had certain trials not go the way I wanted to and then also setting certain deadlines for me, making sure I met them and just encouraging me to do my best.I remember, especially during the summer, I was there for maybe 15 to 20 hours a week. And we were really trying to get the paper published. At the very end, it was a lot of data collection, a lot of writing. And I credit Dr. Joung with coordinating me and Phillip, and just making sure that we got everything done in time and that time management wasn't a problem. That's definitely a lesson I learned from him.                Andy Shar, left, and Daeha Joung, Ph.D., center, inspect the flexible 3D printing ink Andy has developed that conducts electricity, which will allow researchers in their lab and other scientists to make wearable devices and eSkin technologies that empower patients to better monitor and take charge of their health. Credit: Allen Jones, Enterprise Marketing and Communications             Daeha JoungWhy does this research matter?eSkin technology is the future of wearable devices. So what Andy, Phillip and I found is that 3D printable electronic skins can be useful for patients who suffer from skin diseases. Or we can have one that does health monitoring so that it's a system where we can directly 3D-print into human organs. We can actually offer new therapeutic options. [As a physicist] I'm not going to use these directly with patients. However, this technology can be transferred to the operating room in the future. Then the patients can have the advantage to use this technology. That is our long-term goal for this project.Let's say we developed a 3D printable electronic device, or wearable flexible device. Now we want to make a connection from this technology into the spinal cord regeneration project. With spinal cord regeneration, there are always issues because of the structural complexity, right? So one of the therapeutic options is stem cell and electrical stimulation therapy. What Andy is doing is adding to it. As Andy mentioned, I am a pioneer of printing stem cells for spinal cord injury regeneration. So now Andy is combining these stem cell printing technologies and these flexible electronics.We want to test how these two different elements of technology can combine to create a new opportunity for spinal cord regeneration. Everything is kind of related. As physicists, as material scientists, as engineers, our long-term goal is we want to produce and provide new therapeutic options and potential future applications for treatments.How did Andy help advance the project?Even before Andy joined, I've been working on 3D-printing flexible electronics. But the point is that every researcher in the world has the problem of printing flexible and conductive ink. I think Andy spent around four or five months [on it].He did the hard work on developing that ink that everyone, most every 3D-printing researcher, was looking for. Then Phillip, our graduate student, expanded the ink's capabilities and applied it to 3D-printed wearable devices. That's why their paper is in one of the top-tier materials science journals. When we talk about this paper, whenever I mention that the first author of this paper is a sophomore, people are amazed. Based on this, we got a lot of conference invitations. This is amazing work.What's one lesson you learned from Andy?Although Andy is an undergraduate, there are many things I learned from him, but the main thing was that I had doubted myself: \"Can I give an independent project to an undergraduate student?\" In general, many PIs do not really give independent projects to undergraduates, but Andy wanted to be very independent. He actually emphasized to me, \"I can do it. I can do it.\" I was a little bit doubtful the very first time; however, I saw his motivation, so that's why I gave him independent projects. He did a great job, and I'm continuously giving him very independent projects.The way I've trained Andy is like a graduate student. So for me, with Andy and the other graduate students, our training for Andy is all the same.Beyond the knowledge he's developed and the ink discovery, Andy is a very motivated student-researcher, so he has a strong sense of responsibility. Research is not only about being smart. Research is about where you get the motivation and what excites you. Andy's an undergraduate student and sophomore who wants to apply to medical school, especially M.D.-Ph.D. programs. I give a lot of credit to Andy\u2014consider how busy he is; however, he still spends a lot of time in the lab. I could see that. I could see he's so excited, and he enjoys his time in the research lab. He's always smiling, and he always has energy to do new challenges.So to come back to the question of what I learned from Andy: Motivation is the most important factor to be successful in research.

  "text": "Prof. Peng Chenhui's team from the School of Physics, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), realized the collective transfer and reconfigurable self-assembly of colloidal particles by combining the light-driven molecular motors with liquid crystal (LC) molecules in the nematic phase whose orientations are programmed with topological patterns and disclination networks.          The work was published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on April 11. Through light irradiation, the cooperative reorganizations of nanomotors induce collective dynamics of the disclination networks. The morphology changes of the disclination lines are utilized to transport and reconfigure the colloidal assemblies in translational, rotational, and programmable fashions. This work opens the door for future applications in micromachines and smart materials.Nanomotors in nature have inspired scientists to design synthetic molecular motors to drive the motion of microscale objects by cooperative action. Light-driven molecular motors have been synthesized, but using their cooperative reorganization to control the collective transport of colloids and to realize the reconfiguration of colloidal assembly remains a challenge.In this work, topological vortices are imprinted in the monolayers of azobenzene molecules which further interface with nematic liquid crystals (LCs). The light-driven cooperative reorientations of the azobenzene molecules induce the collective motion of LC molecules and thus the spatiotemporal evolutions of the nematic disclination networks which are defined by the controlled patterns of vortices. Continuum simulations provide physical insight into the morphology change of the disclination networks.Collective transport of the colloidal assembly by controlling the linear polarization Pe. The video is recorded at 20 fps; the playback rate is 120 fps. Credit: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023). DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2221718120When microcolloids are dispersed in the LC medium, the colloidal assembly is not only transported and reconfigured by the collective change of the disclination lines but also controlled by the elastic energy landscape defined by the predesigned orientational patterns. The collective transport and reconfiguration of colloidal assemblies can also be programmed by manipulating the irradiated polarization. This work provides opportunities to design programmable colloidal machines and smart composite materials.In the study, the team also elucidated how the pre-designed topological defects control the motion mechanism of colloidal particles on the disclination lines, which is determined by the elastic properties of the local pre-designed unfolding and bending deformation of liquid crystals. Thus, the physical mechanism of this light-driven programmable colloidal self-assembly lies in the cooperative reorganization of the nanoscale molecular machines by light, and the interaction of the molecular machines with the liquid crystal molecules is used to control the change of the nanoscale liquid crystal molecular orientation.Due to the long-range ordered nature of the liquid crystal molecules, a change in the orientation of the surface macroscale liquid crystal molecules is triggered. This macroscopic change further drives the change of liquid crystal microstructure inside the sample through surface anchoring, thus enabling macroscopic-scale reconfiguration toward disclination networks and colloidal self-assembly.

  "text": "Chinese researchers have successfully fabricated mechanical metamaterials with ultra-high energy absorption capacity using ion track technology. The results were published in Nature Communications as an Editor's Highlight.          The study was conducted by the researchers from the Materials Research Center of the Institute of Modern Physics (IMP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and their collaborators from Chongqing University.Mechanical metamaterials refer to a class of composite materials with artificially designed structures, which exhibit extraordinary mechanical properties that traditional materials do not have. Among them, energy absorption mechanical metamaterials can absorb mechanical energy more efficiently, which requires the material itself to equip both high strength and high strain capacity, which, however, hardly co-exist in general.Nanolattice is a new class of mechanical metamaterials with characteristic sizes on the nanoscale. Due to size effects, geometrical configuration, and material selection, the mechanical properties of this type of porous materials are very different from those of bulk materials. Given its even better mechanical properties with lighter weight, nanolattice is expected to bring revolutionary applications in the field of high-performance functional materials in the future.Beam-structured nanolattice is the research focus of nanolattice metamaterials. However, it has been challenging to fabricate metallic beam nanolattice with beam diameter less than 100 nm, so its mechanical properties still remain ambiguous.In this work, based on the Heavy Ion Research Facility at Lanzhou (HIRFL), the researchers fabricated a new type of quasi-body centered cubic (quasi-BCC) beam nanolattice mechanical metamaterial with ion track technology. The beam diameter of the quasi-BCC nanolattice can be as small as 34 nm, a record low beam diameter of mechanical metamaterials.Additionally, the researchers demonstrated that gold and copper quasi-BCC beam nanolattices have excellent energy absorption capacity and compressive strength. The experiments showed that the energy absorption capacity of the copper quasi-BCC beam nanolattice exceeds that of the previously reported beam nanolattice. The yield strength of the gold and copper quasi-BCC beam nanolattices exceeds that of the corresponding bulk materials at less than half the density of the latter.Furthermore, the researchers revealed that the extraordinary mechanical properties are mainly due to the synergistic effect of size effects, quasi-BCC geometry, and good ductility of metals.This study sheds light on the mechanical properties of the beam nanolattices, and applies ion track technology as a new method for the exploration of beam nanolattice with ultra-high energy absorption capacity.

  "answer_race": " Graphite--a new material for heat removal",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the material that is used for heat dissipation?",
  "answer_squad": " graphite",
  "text": "Scientists from the Institute of Industrial Science at The University of Tokyo studied the flow of thermal energy in purified ribbons of graphite and showed that heat can move more like a liquid, rather than diffusing randomly, under certain conditions. This work can lead to more efficient heat removal from electronic devices, including such as smartphones, computers, and LEDs.          Before the modern understanding of thermodynamics, scientists sometimes thought of heat as a fluid called \"caloric.\" However, we now know that heat is actually the random kinetic energy possessed by the vibrating atoms or molecules that make up a material.Sometimes, the vibrations can be thought of physical particles called phonons, which are the main contributors of heat conduction in semiconductors. In a surprising twist, in certain materials like graphite the phonons may indeed behave in a manner very similar to a fluid. However, this theory has remained relatively obscure.Now, a team of researchers led by the Institute of Industrial Science at The University of Tokyo have used theoretical and experimental results to better understand the fluid-like nature of phonons. They show that when a sample of graphite is made from isotopically pure carbon, meaning that only carbon-12 atoms are present, heat can be conducted much more rapidly, almost like water flowing through a pipe.This was termed \"phonon Poiseuille flow,\" based on the theory of viscus fluids flowing in a closed tube. The effect was strongest in graphite at a temperature of about 90 Kelvin. However, natural graphite contains about 1% other isotopes of carbon, particularly carbon-13, which limits this effect in natural samples.\"Our study clarified the theoretical criteria for the formation of phonon Poiseuille flow in graphite, a material that shows strong anisotropy, which had not been clear before,\" lead author Dr. Xin Huang says. Graphite, also known as pencil lead, is very inexpensive and easy to produce.As a result, it is already being used for heat dissipation in some electronic devices that produce a lot of waste energy during operation. Using purified graphite that had at most 0.02% carbon-13, the team was able to observe a heat conductivity that was more than double the value of natural graphite. The fact that this enhancement only occurred over a specific temperature range was evidence that fluid-like collective motion of phonons was the mechanism.\"In conventional Poiseuille flow, the velocity is highest near the center, which is what we propose happens with the phonons in our experiments,\" senior author Professor Masahiro Nomura says. In addition to graphite, this phenomenon has also been observed in solid helium and black phosphorus.Theoretically, this phenomenon is also possible even at room temperature. This work can help keep sensitive computer processors cool, even as they increase their density inside devices.The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications.

  "text": "Greener processes for producing a crystalline component found in biomedicines as well as everyday skincare products and electronics have been developed at The University of Sheffield.          Researchers from The Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering have published their findings in the journal Nanoscale Advances in a paper titled \"Controlling simonkolleite crystallisation via metallic Zn oxidation in a betaine hydrochloride solution.\"The research focused on a type of crystal known as simonkolleite, which helps zinc oxide (ZnO)\u2014a metal by-product of many industrial processes\u2014form into a perfect hexagonal shape. This shape is important for uses such as in the delivery of slow-release drugs as well as other applications which require a very specific type of crystal structure.However, the current production of simonkolleite is not environmentally friendly due to the high temperatures required and toxic materials used.The new research used a material called betaine in the production, which is an ionic liquid that can be extracted from plants, making it a cost-effective and more environmentally friendly option than the ammonia that is used normally.That's because betaine has a much lower toxicity than ammonia, meaning it's also safer to use.The process developed by the researchers is also easier than traditional methods, which requires the pH (i.e. how acidic or alkaline something is) to be controlled as well as very high temperatures.The new process can be done at room temperature and without controlling the pH\u2014which also helps benefit the environment as energy is not being used to raise the temperature.Shaoqing Qu, a Ph.D. student in the department whose research is detailed in the paper, said, \"I'm thrilled to have published this research detailing more sustainable methods of producing zinc oxide, which is so important to many industries. I'm now looking forward to completing further research in this area as I continue my Ph.D.\"The researchers are now exploring the use of other ionic liquids with an aim of improving the performance.

  "question_squad": " What is the thinnest material known to exist?",
  "answer_squad": " graphene",
  "text": "Moir\u00e9 patterns occur everywhere. They are created by layering two similar but not identical geometric designs. A common example is the pattern that sometimes emerges when viewing a chain-link fence through a second chain-link fence.          For more than 10 years, scientists have been experimenting with the moir\u00e9 pattern that emerges when a sheet of graphene is placed between two sheets of boron nitride. The resulting moir\u00e9 pattern has shown tantalizing effects that could vastly improve semiconductor chips that are used to power everything from computers to cars.A new study led by University at Buffalo researchers, and published in Nature Communications, demonstrated that graphene can live up to its promise in this context.\"Our recent work shows that this particular sandwich of graphene and boron nitride elicits properties that are suitable for use in new technological applications,\" said Jonathan Bird, Ph.D., professor and chair of the Department of Electrical Engineering at UB.Graphene is made of carbon, just like charcoal and diamonds. What distinguishes graphene is the way the carbon atoms are put together: they are linked in a hexagonal or honeycomb pattern. The resulting material is the thinnest material known to exist, so thin that scientists call it two-dimensional.Left alone, graphene conducts electricity well\u2014too well, in fact, to be useful in microelectronic technology. But by sandwiching graphene between two layers of boron nitride, which also has a hexagonal pattern, a moir\u00e9 pattern results. The presence of this pattern is accompanied by dramatic changes in the properties of the graphene, essentially turning what would normally be a conducting material into one with (semiconductor-like) properties that are more amenable to use in advanced microelectronics.This research establishes how the moir\u00e9 pattern in graphene can be adapted to use in technological applications such as new types of communication devices, lasers and light-emitting diodes. \"Our work demonstrated the viability of this approach, showing that the graphene/boron nitride sandwich that we are studying does indeed have the favorable properties needed for microelectronics,\" said Bird.The semiconductor chips in question are essential not just in smartphones and medical devices but also in smart-home gadgets such as dishwashers, vacuums, and home-security systems. \"Modern technology relies on the semiconductor chips that form the heart of their systems and control their operation,\" said Bird. \"When you talk into your cell phone, it's the chip that converts your voice to an electronic signal and transmits it to a tower.\"      The graphene/boron-nitride heterostructure appears to have properties that are amenable to engineering. Developing future technology based on these materials may depend on discovering and harnessing properties that allow for greater speed and functionality. Bird noted that there is typically a lag between a discovery, the excitement about a discovery, and realizing the promise of the discovery. Graphene\u2014so common that it's in any note scribbled with pencil\u2014wasn't discovered until 2004.Bird earned a Ph.D. in physics, but he was drawn to electrical engineering because it allowed him to explore quantum physics through research on semiconductors. Quantum physics\u2014\"the kind of magical physics that occurs at the atomic scale,\" he explained\u2014can be observed through experiments using technology that explores material and processes at the atomic level.\"We can get a system to respond to actions we take, and that response reflects details of the atomic and quantum nature of the system,\" he said. Graphene attracted his attention because it appeared to be a way to study quantum effects through work on semiconductors. At UB, he established a lab called NoMaD, where he, his colleagues, and their students study \"quantum phenomena occurring at the nanoscale.\" Graduates have gone on to careers at Intel and IBM as well as other universities.In this research, Bird and his team have explored the properties of graphene within a certain limit that must be achieved to create new technologies. The semiconductor chip industry is a massive industry that continues to grow, demanding new materials, new ways to use existing materials, and a new workforce capable of developing both.

  "answer_squad": " BaTiO3 nanosheets",
  "text": "Researchers at the Institute for Future Materials and Systems at Nagoya University in Japan have successfully synthesized barium titanate (BaTiO3) nanosheets with a thickness of 1.8 nanometers, the thinnest thickness ever created for a free-standing film. Given that thickness is related to functionality, their findings open the door to smaller, more efficient devices. The research was published in the journal Advanced Electronic Materials.          The development of ever-thinner materials with new electronic functions is a highly competitive area of research. Such devices are especially important in ferroelectrics, materials that have a polarization that can be reversed by an electric field. This ability to reverse polarization makes these materials useful in memory and vibrational power generation.However, as the materials used in these devices become smaller, they exhibit unexpected properties that complicate their industrial use. A big problem is the \"size effect,\" as when the material's thickness is reduced to a few nanometers, its ferroelectric properties disappear.Now, a team from Nagoya University's Department of Materials Chemistry and the Institute of Materials and Systems for Sustainability (IMASS), led by Professor Minoru Osada (he/him), has successfully synthesized defect-free BaTiO3 nanosheets with ferroelectric properties at a thickness of 1.8 nm using an aqueous solution process. The result is the thinnest free-standing film ever made. Although thin, the film exhibits ferroelectric properties, representing an important breakthrough in the fabrication of thin, ferroelectrically active films.\"However, for BaTiO3, a typical ferroelectric material, it is difficult to synthesize nanosheets by the conventional synthetic method. Therefore, it was necessary to develop a new synthetic method,\" Osada said. \"Generally, the synthesis of BaTiO3 requires a calcination process that requires temperatures of 1,000\u00b0C or higher. In contrast, we synthesized BaTiO3 nanosheets at a low temperature of 60\u00b0C using our process. Since the thickness of the film can be controlled using this method by varying the reaction time, the synthesis of nanosheets with two to six lattices was achieved.\"\"If nanosheets with a thickness of a few nanometers can be synthesized in ferroelectrics, new properties and applications are expected to be discovered.

  "text": "Sometimes to make big breakthroughs, you have to start very small.          One way that scientists can get the most out of certain quantum materials is by fabricating nanoscale structures that generate new properties at the material's surfaces and edges. Cornell researchers used the relatively straightforward process of thermomechanical nanomolding to create single-crystalline nanowires that can enable metastable phases that would otherwise be difficult to achieve with conventional methods.\"We're really interested in this synthesis method of nanomolding because it allows us to make many different kinds of materials into nanoscale quickly and easily, yet with some of the control that other nanomaterial synthesis methods lack, particularly control over the morphology and the size,\" said Judy Cha, professor of materials science and engineering in Cornell Engineering, who led the project.The team's paper, \"Nanomolding of Metastable Mo4P3,\" published April 12 in Matter. The paper's lead author is postdoctoral researcher Mehrdad Kiani.In thermomechanical nanomolding, a material is consolidated into a bulk feedstock, put into a porous mold and pressed at high temperatures for several hours. The resulting structure is then separated from the feedstock\u2014in this case, by ultrasound vibrations, a process known as sonication\u2014and deposited on a silicon wafer or other surface.The benefit of this process is that nanoscale amounts of solid materials can be molded at temperatures well below their melting point, representing easy processing conditions. This enables a wide range of materials to be leveraged for untapped exotic properties, similar to the way that graphene has revolutionized conduction in electronics.Cha's team has been experimenting with molybdenum monophosphide (MoP), which is a topological compound.\"Topological metals are predicted to have decreasing resistance as you go to smaller sizes, and MoP is not only topological but also has a really high carrier density (electrons per volume), which should further help bring the resistance down,\" Kiani said.Cha and her team have previously shown that nanomolding of topological nanowires could accelerate the discovery of new electrical properties for applications such as quantum computing, microelectronics and clean-energy catalysts. These nanowires would be particularly well-suited for being interconnects between the billions of transistors in integrated circuits.Earlier this year, the group demonstrated that MoP nanowires had such low resistivity, they outperform copper interconnects.\"That was a surprising discovery,\" Cha said. \"But the challenge was, we needed to continue to make MoP smaller and smaller, and the methods that we've been using just weren't getting us there. So, then along came a nanomolding method, and we saw it as a way to make even smaller MoP nanowires to continue to check whether the resistivity is going to be still much lower than copper.\"Instead, they found the nanowire molding process converted a crystal structure of MoP into a different composition: Mo4P3.\"That was not something we expected. And even more surprising was that this phase Mo4P3 is not a stable phase that you normally get,\" Cha said. \"Now we realize that this molding method can potentially get us metastable phases.\"The metastable Mo4P3's resistivity was about 75% higher than MoP's, so MoP still remains the most promising candidate for interconnects.\"This really broadens our exploration space for new materials. And who knows what the possibilities may be?\" Cha said. \"When graphene was first discovered, it was not at all clear that we could use it in a golf ball, for example, to think about a mundane application. For now, we want to find the next example of Mo4P3, another metastable phase that we can arrest and then make it into nanowires.\" More information:Mehrdad T.

  "answer_race": " Blue light is a new way to study nanoscale materials.",
  "question_squad": " What is the name of the new microscopy technique that uses blue light?",
  "answer_squad": " s-SNOM",
  "text": "With a new microscopy technique that uses blue light to measure electrons in semiconductors and other nanoscale materials, a team of Brown University researchers is opening a new realm of possibilities in the study of these critical components, which can help power devices like mobile phones and laptops.          The findings are a first in nanoscale imaging and provide a workaround to a longstanding problem that has greatly limited the study of key phenomena in a wide variety of materials that could one day lead to more energy-efficient semiconductors and electronics. The work published in Light: Science & Applications.\"There is a lot of interest these days in studying materials with nanoscale resolution using optics,\" said Daniel Mittleman, a professor in Brown's School of Engineering and author of the paper describing the work. \"As the wavelength gets shorter, this becomes a lot harder to implement. As a result, nobody had ever done it with blue light until now.\"Typically, when researchers use optics like lasers to study nanoscale materials, they use light that emits long wavelengths such as red light or infrared. The method the researchers looked at in the study is called scattering-type scanning near-field microscopy (s-SNOM). It involves scattering light from a sharpened tip that is only a few tens of nanometers across. The tip hovers just above the sample material to be imaged.When that sample is illuminated with optical light, the light scatters and a portion of the scattered light is left with information about the nano-sized region of the sample directly beneath the tip. The researchers analyze that scattered radiation to extract information about this small volume of material.The technique has been at the foundation of many technological advances, but it hits a wall when it comes to using light with a much shorter wavelength, like blue light. This means that using blue light, which is better suited for studying certain materials for which red light is ineffective, to gain new insights from already well-studied semiconductors has been out of reach since the 1990s when the technique was invented.In the new study, the researchers from Brown present how they got around this roadblock to perform what's believed to be the first ever experimental demonstration of s-SNOM using blue light instead of red.      For the experiment, the researchers used the blue light to get measurements from a silicon sample that cannot be obtained using red light. The measurements provided a valuable proof-of-concept about the use of shorter wavelengths to study materials on the nanoscale.\"We were able to compare these new measurements to what one might expect to see from silicon, and the match was very good,\" Mittleman said. \"It confirms that our measurement works and that we understand how to interpret the results. Now we can start studying all these materials in a way that we couldn't before.\"To conduct the experiment, the researchers had to get creative. Essentially, they decided to make things easier by making them more complicated. With the typical technique, for instance, blue light is hard to use because its wavelength is so short, meaning that it is more challenging to focus over the right spot near the metal tip. If not aligned just right, the measurement won't work. With the red light, this focusing condition is more relaxed, making it easier to align the optics in order to extract the scattered light efficiently.With those challenges in mind, the researchers used the blue light to not only illuminate the sample so that the light scatters, but also to produce a burst of terahertz radiation from the sample. The radiation carries important information about the sample's electrical properties.While the solution adds an extra step and increases the amount of data the scientists have to analyze, it eliminates the need to be as precise in how they align the tip over the sample. The key here is that because the terahertz radiation has a much longer wavelength, it is much more easily aligned.\"It still has to be really close, but it doesn't have to be as close,\" Mittleman said. \"When you hit it with the light, you'll still be able to get information in the terahertz.\"The researchers are excited to see what comes next in terms of new information and discoveries the method leads to, such better insights into semiconductors used to produce blue LED technology. Mittleman is currently developing plans to use blue light to analyze materials researchers haven't been able to before.

  "text": "Researchers from the National Graphene Institute (NGI) have created \"intelligent\" membranes whose \"memory\" can be used in areas like smart separation technology, wound management, drug delivery, sensors and memory devices.          \"The history of membrane development spans more than 100 years and has led to a revolution in industrial separation processes,\" says Professor Rahul Raveendran Nair, Carlsberg/Royal Academy of Engineering Research Chair and study team leader. \"In recent years, there has been some effort towards making membranes that mimic biological structures, particularly their 'intelligent' characteristics.\"Now, in research published today in Nature, scientists explain how they have developed intelligent membranes that can alter their properties depending on the environment and remember how permeable they were before. This means the membranes can adapt to different conditions in their environment, and more importantly, memorize their state, a feature that can be exploited in many different applications.A phenomenon known as hysteresis is the most common expression of memory or intelligence in a material. It refers to the situation where a system's current properties are dependent and related to its previous state. Hysteresis is commonly observed in magnetic materials. For example, a magnet may have more than one possible magnetic moment in each magnetic field depending on the field the magnet was subjected to in the past. Hysteresis is rarely seen, however, in molecular transport through artificial membranes.\"Coming up with simple and effective clean water solutions is one of our greatest global challenges. This study shows that fundamental molecular level insights and nanoscale materials offer great potential for the development of 'smart' membranes for water purification and other applications,\" said Professor Angelos Michaelides of the University of Cambridge.In this work, the Manchester team, in collaboration with scientists from University of Cambridge, Xiamen University, Dalian University of Technology, University of York, and National University of Singapore has developed intelligent membranes based on MoS2 (a two-dimensional material called molybdenum disulfide) that can remember how permeable they were before. The researchers have shown that the way ions and water infiltrate the membranes can be regulated by controlling the external pH.The membranes mimic the function of biological cell membranes and display hysteretic ion and water transport behavior in response to the pH, which means they remember what pH they were exposed to before. \"The memory effects we have seen are unique to these membranes and have never been observed before in any inorganic membranes,\" said co-first author Dr. Amritroop Achari of the University of Manchester.The researchers demonstrated that the biomimetic effect could be used to improve autonomous wound infection sensing. To do this, they placed the membranes in artificial wound exudate, which simulates the liquid produced by wounds, and subjected them to changes in pH. The membranes only allowed permeation of the wound exudate at pH levels relevant to an infected wound, thus allowing them to be used as sensors for infection detection. The researchers say the new membranes can also be used in a host of other pH-dependent applications, from nanofiltration to mimicking the function of neuronal cells.Co-author Professor Kostya Novoselov, Langworthy Professor in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Manchester and a professor at the Centre for Advanced 2D Materials, National University of Singapore, said, \"The uniqueness in this membrane is that its hysteretic pH response can be seen as a memory function, which opens a lot of interesting avenues for the creation of smart membranes and other structures. Research in this direction can play a pivotal role in the design of intelligent technologies for tomorrow.\" More information:C. Y.

  "text": "The University of Cordoba has developed a biodegradable material, made with nanocellulose and photocatalytic particles, for the efficient decontamination of urban air.          Air pollution and its high concentration in cities is one of the problems facing society today, due to its harmful effects on the environment, but also on human health. One of the causes of this pollution is the increase in nitrogen oxide emissions, mainly due to the use of fossil fuels.While the emissions of these gases are being reduced, photocatalysis is proving to be a tool for decontaminating air in cities: materials called semiconductors are created which, when coming into contact with the pollutant, under the effect of ultraviolet light, cause it to degrade, thus reducing its concentration in the air.Two research groups of the University of Cordoba, belonging to the Chemical Institute for Energy and the Environment (IQUEMA),and the Department of Inorganic Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, have been working to produce these materials. The team, formed by the BioPrEn and Inorganic Chemistry groups, has obtained biodegradable materials to fix nanoparticles with photocatalytic activity (in this case, titanium dioxide), augmenting the power and, therefore, the decontaminating effect.The advances made by this work consist of \"first, the creation of a biodegradable medium based on nanocellulose, obtained from agricultural waste; and, second, the development of a surface modification process of these nanoparticles, which results on their greater dispersion and immobilization, and, therefore, enhanced photocatalytic activity,\" explains one of the authors of the article, researcher Eduardo Espinosa.The progress is twofold: it is possible to create a sustainable material by recovering a form of agricultural waste(thus contributing to the Circular Economy) and the process of fixing photocatalytic nanoparticles to this biodegradable medium is simplified. The benefit is, in fact, exponential, since the result is greater air decontamination due to the porosity and the three-dimensional nature of the material, which means that more photocatalytic particles are exposed to ultraviolet light compared to an opaque material or one in which only one surface is exposed to light.What is it like? Where is it used?Those who see this material will recognize a light, solid foam, but with very little density, similar to insulation coverings used in construction, or the popular corn \"puffs.\" To effect decontamination \"it can be used as a porous filter through which the gas stream passes, always exposed to ultraviolet light, and the gas comes out decontaminated,\" says Espinosa. Thus, gases released by industry, for example, would come out almost clean of nitrogen oxides.A further step in this research would be to modify the photocatalytic particle so that it is more sensitive to light from the visible spectrum, without having to resort to ultraviolet sources. In this way the photocatalytic power would be activated by sunlight alone, and this type of technology could be applied to textiles and other types of materials, thereby reducing the concentration of gases only through exposure to the sun.The study is published in the journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering.

  "text": "Fabrics that resist knife cuts can help prevent injuries and save lives. But a sharp enough knife or a very forceful jab can get through some of these materials. Now, researchers report in ACS Applied Nano Materials that carbon nanotubes and polyacrylate strengthen conventional aramid to produce lightweight, soft fabrics that provide better protection. Applications include anti-stabbing clothing, helmets and insoles, as well as cut-resistant packaging.          Soft body armor is typically made from aramid, ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene, or carbon and glass fabrics. Their puncture resistance depends, in part, on the friction between yarn fibers within these materials. Up to a point, greater friction means greater protection. Manufacturers can boost friction by roughening the fiber surfaces, but that requires a complicated process, and product yield is low.Alternatively, the bonding force between yarns can be enhanced by adding another component, such as a sheer thickening fluid (STF) or a polyurethane (PU) coating. But these composite fabrics can't simultaneously satisfy the requirements for thinness, flexibility and light weight. Ting-Ting Li, Xing-xiang Zhang and colleagues wanted to find another way to improve performance while satisfying these criteria.The researchers tested a polyacrylate emulsion (PAE), STF and PU as coatings on aramid fabric. In simulated stabbing tests, aramid fabric coated with PAE outperformed the uncoated material used by itself or in combination with STF or PU.Carbon nanotubes are known to make composites tougher, and adding them to aramid/PAE further improved impact resistance. The team says that's because the nanotubes created bridges between the fibers, thereby increasing friction. The nanotubes also formed a thin, protective network that dispersed stress away from the point of impact and helped prevent fiber disintegration. The new lightweight, flexible, puncture-resistant composite fabric could be useful in military and civilian applications, according to the researchers.

  "text": "Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are novel therapeutics that can be used to treat a wide range of diseases. This has led to a growing demand for selective, efficient, and safe ways of delivering siRNA in cells. Now, in a cooperation between the Universities of Amsterdam and Leiden, researchers have developed dedicated molecular nanocages for siRNA delivery. In a paper just out in the journal Chem they present nanocages that are easy to prepare and display tunable siRNA delivery characteristics.          The nanocages were developed in the research group for Homogeneous, Supramolecular and Bio-inspired catalysis of Prof. Joost Reek and Bas de Bruin at the University of Amsterdam's Van 't Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences, and further studies in the group Prof. Alexander Kros at the Leiden Institute of Chemistry.The researchers were motivated by the potential of siRNA in gene therapy, which requires the need for effective delivery systems. They set out to develop nanocages with functional groups at the outside, making the cages capable of binding siRNA strands. As the binding is based on reversible bonds, the siRNA can in principle be released in a cellular environment. To explore the delivery characteristics of their nanocages, the researchers performed a laboratory study using various human cancer cells.A range of nanocagesThe nanocages are constructions of small molecular building blocks, so-called ditopic ligands, that are connected using metal atoms. A typical cage consists of 12 metal atoms and 24 ligands, hence the abbreviation M12L24. The researchers designed and synthesized five different ligands to form molecular cages with different siRNA binding affinities. They then prepared a range of siRNA binding nanocages using platinum or palladium as connecting metal. The palladium nanocages are less stable in a cellular environment, and decomposition is one of the siRNA releasing mechanisms.                Four Pt12L24 nanocage structures investigated in the study, using platinum and a variety of ligands. The first nanocage was also synthesised in a variant using palladium instead of platinum. Image taken from the paper. Credit: University of Amsterdam             After screening nanocage characteristics such as stability and siRNA binding capability, the delivery characteristics were put to the test in assays based on siRNA-mediated Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) silencing. The cages were used to deliver siRNA to human GFP-expressing cells, so that fluorescence measurements could establish successful siRNA delivery. Two types of human cell lines were used: HeLa and U2Os.Cage composition determines siRNA deliveryTo their surprise, the researchers could not only demonstrate satisfying siRNA delivery, but also discovered a remarkable differentiation depending on the metal used in the nanocage. Where a platinum-based Pt12L24 nanocage showed highly effective siRNA delivery to U2OS cells, it showed little efficiency for HeLa. By contrast, the palladium-based Pd12L24 nanocage, derived from the same ligand building block, delivered siRNA to HeLa but not to U2OS. Such differentiation could not be observed in experiments were a commercially applied delivery system (lipofectamine) was used. The M12L24 nanocages thus introduce the possibility of tuning siRNA delivery characteristics by tuning the nanocage composition.      In their Chem paper, the researchers consider this unique cell selectivity feature of the nanoparticles a promising addition to the field of targeted RNA gene material delivery, whose full potential is yet to be uncovered. Even though the current results were obtained in highly controlled laboratory research, they expect that the tunable RNA delivery of their nanocages will spawn future developments of highly desirable selective RNA nanomedicines.

  "text": "Two-dimensional (2D) magnets, also known as magnetic van der Waals materials, have advantageous electrical and mechanical properties, such as antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetism. These properties make them particularly promising for the development of new technologies and systems, including spintronic devices and 2D nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS).          For instance, 2D magnets could be used to improve the performance and reduce the size of planar inductors, tiny nanoelectromechanical devices that can be applied to many real-world problems. By integrating these devices with capacitors, electronics engineers can also create filters that can detect and process wireless communication signals.Theoretically, incorporating 2D magnetic materials into these filters could help to reduce their size and power consumption. However, most 2D ferromagnets that could be used to create these filters have low Curie temperatures, which hinders their application in this area.Researchers at Fudan University, the Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute and other institutes worldwide recently created new low-pass filters using films of a 2D van der Waals material that they engineered to exhibit a higher Curie temperature. These filters, presented in a paper published in Nature Electronics, were found to achieve remarkable performances despite their smaller size.\"The low Curie temperature of most 2D magnets limits practical applications,\" Zihan Li, Shanshan Liu and their colleagues wrote in their paper. \"We report van der Waals ferromagnetic low-pass filters based on wafer-scale iron germanium telluride (Fe5+xGeTe2) thin films grown by molecular-beam epitaxy.\"The researchers created the 2D ferromagnetic films used in their study using a technique known as molecular-beam epitaxy growth. The films were grown on sapphire in an ultrahigh-vacuum molecular-beam epitaxy system at high temperatures.Li, Liu and his colleagues showed that the Curie temperature of their films could be adapted via in situ iron doping. This process entails the introduction of iron into a material to alter some of its properties.\"We show that the Curie temperature of the Fe5+xGeTe2 system can be continuously modulated from 260 to 380 K via in situ iron doping,\" Li, Liu and their colleagues wrote in their paper. \"Few-layer Fe5+xGeTe2 is used to fabricate planar spiral inductors, with the 2D magnetic core providing inductance enhancement of 74% at room temperature compared with an inductor without the core.\"Li, Liu and his colleagues then combined the 2D magnet-based inductors they developed with capacitors to create low-pass Butterworth filters. When they evaluated these filters, they found that they achieved very promising results, suggesting that they could ultimately be integrated with real-world wireless communication systems.\"The filters offer a broad dynamic range of around 40 dB, and the \u20133 dB cut-off frequency can be tuned from 18 to 30 Hz by using different inductors in the inductance\u2013capacitance circuit,\" Li, Liu and their colleagues wrote in their paper.The recent study by this team of researchers demonstrates the possibility of using 2D ferromagnets with a high Curie temperature to create inductors and potentially other nanoscale NEMS devices. In the future, it could inspire other research groups to develop other nanoelectromechanical devices using similar methods and material synthesis processes.

A wound disrupts the normal function of the skin and can take a long time to heal, be very painful for the patient, and may\u2014in a worst-case scenario\u2014lead to death if not treated correctly. Also, hard-to-heal wounds pose a great burden on society, representing about half of all costs of out-patient care.In traditional wound care, dressings are changed regularly, about every two days. To check whether the wound is infected, care staff have to lift the dressing and make an assessment based on appearance and tests. This is a painful procedure that disturbs wound healing as the scab breaks repeatedly. The risk of infection also increases every time the wound is exposed.Researchers at Link\u00f6ping University, in collaboration with colleagues from \u00d6rebro and Lule\u00e5 Universities, have now developed a wound dressing made of nanocellulose that can reveal early signs of infection without interfering with the healing process.\"Being able to see instantly whether a wound has become infected, without having to lift the dressing, opens up for a new type of wound care that can lead to more efficient care and improve life for patients with hard-to-heal wounds. It can also reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics,\" says Daniel Aili, professor in the Division of Biophysics and Bioengineering at Link\u00f6ping University.                To make the wound dressing show the elevated pH value, the researchers used bromthymol blue, BTB, a dye that changes color from yellow to blue when the pH value exceeds 7. Credit: Olov Planthaber             The dressing is made of tight mesh nanocellulose, preventing bacteria and other microbes from getting in. At the same time, the material lets gases and liquid through, something that is important to wound healing. The idea is that once applied, the dressing will stay on during the entire healing process. Should the wound become infected, the dressing will show a color shift.Non-infected wounds have a pH value of about 5.5. When an infection occurs, the wound becomes increasingly basic and may have a pH value of 8, or even higher. This is because bacteria in the wound change their surroundings to fit their optimal growth environment. An elevated pH value in the wound can be detected long before any pus, soreness or redness, which are the most common signs of infection.      To make the wound dressing show the elevated pH value, the researchers used bromthymol blue, BTB, a dye that changes color from yellow to blue when the pH value exceeds 7. For BTB to be used in the dressing without being compromised, it was loaded onto a silica material with pores only a few nanometers in size. The silica material could then be combined with the dressing material without compromising the nanocellulose. The result is a wound dressing that turns blue when there is an infection.Wound infections are often treated with antibiotics that spread throughout the body. But if the infection is detected at an early stage, local treatment of the wound may suffice. This is why Aili and his colleagues at \u00d6rebro University are also developing anti-microbial substances based on so-called lipopeptides that kill off all types of bacteria.\"The use of antibiotics makes infections increasingly problematic, as multi-resistant bacteria are becoming more common. If we can combine the anti-microbial substance with the dressing, we minimize the risk of infection and reduce the overuse of antibiotics,\" says Aili.Aili says that the new wound dressing and the anti-microbial substance are part of developing a new type of wound treatment in out-patient care. But as all products to be used in medical care settings have to pass rigorous and expensive testing, he thinks that it will be five to ten years before it will be available there.

  "text": "The first rapid test for mpox, more commonly known as monkeypox, has been developed by a team of researchers led by Penn State. The selective molecular sensor can detect the virus within minutes, without the use of any high-end instrumental techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Current tests require health care providers to swab lesions and send the samples to labs to be tested, which can take several days.          The technique, which was recently reported in the journal Advanced Functional Materials, uses nanomaterials heterostructures\u2014zero-dimensional spherical gold nanoparticles and two-dimensional hafnium disulfide nanoplatelets\u2014as building blocks to create a platform technology suitable for detecting trace amounts of genetic materials in biological samples.\"This is a major breakthrough in terms of how we manage the virus, as it is the first rapid test for mpox,\" said Dipanjan Pan, Penn State's Dorothy Foehr Huck & J. Lloyd Huck Chair Professor in Nanomedicine, who led the study. \"While current caseloads are relatively low, as the weather warms and people become more active, cases could spike as they did last summer.\"\"But it's also important to note that this new technology can help us to prepare for the next epidemic or even pandemic,\" said Pan, who is also a professor of nuclear engineering and of materials science and engineering. \"With slight modification of the molecules used for targeting the genetic sequences, we will be able to specifically detect other viruses, bacteria or fungi using the same method.\"Dating back to the 1970s, the first human mpox case was identified in the Democratic Republic of Congo and was considered to be endemic only in Nigeria and some parts of central and west Africa. Since May of 2022, the virus has spread into more than 100 countries and caused over 86,900 infections across the world with approximately one-third of global cases concentrated in the United States.Mpox virus is transmitted primarily through close physical contact and causes a disease with symptoms similar to smallpox, although less severe. A growing body of research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows people can spread mpox virus to others days before symptoms appear, making early detection via testing a critical tool to mitigate spread.Currently, therapeutics and two-dose vaccines remain insufficient at stopping contagion, leaving rapid diagnosis as the only option for disease containment, Pan explained. PCR is the only available FDA-approved test known for mpox, despite its limitations of complex sample collection, transportation and insufficient access to advanced instrumental facilities. A rapid test, requiring only a small sample of lesion swab and short wait time for results, could dramatically slow the rate of transmission for the virus, he added.      \"We were interested in developing a sensitive detection method for pathogens generally, and also wanted to apply the concept to an emerging pathogen like mpox, because there is a real-world urgency for this rapid nucleic acid test,\" Pan said. \"There will be a significant impact on public health as a result of this technology.\"The technology employs \"plasmonic\" nanoparticles, tiny metallic particles with unique optical properties due to their size and shape. In this case, the nanoscale metal particle is gold, which is refined to such a small scale that it is considered zero-dimensional. It is layered with hafnium disulfide, an inorganic, two-dimensional compound of hafnium and sulfur that is only a few atoms thick.\"There are many plasmonic tests for pathogens out there,\" Pan said. \"But this is the first time we've demonstrated that a zero-dimensional plasmonic particle and two-dimensional nanoplatelets form a heterostructure that leads to enhancement of plasmon, which in turn offers an improvement in sensitivity.\"The zero-dimensional gold nanoparticle and two-dimensional hafnium sulfide interact to form heterostructures that function as highly accurate sensors, with optical properties that change dramatically in the presence of external triggers, such as genetic material.\"Our work deals with plasmonics, which is the manipulation of light's flow using nanostructured metallic materials,\" Pan said. \"Through the use of novel materials and chemistry, we are attempting to understand how these plasmon properties are manipulated to respond to various biological signals.\"In this case, the signal was from trace amounts of viral DNA, specifically the conserved region of the mpox virus genome that is not subject to mutations. Nanoparticles have been used in the past to observe changes in biological systems, Pan said, but this is the first time two nanoscale objects in two different dimensions have been deployed to detect an emerging pathogen.\"This technique does not require expensive equipment or skilled personnel, and it can be tailored for future mutations or emerging pathogens,\" Pan said.He explained that his lab is now testing the system against a panel of other pathogens to confirm its broad applicability for viral detection. Once the test is validated clinically, the lab will look for commercial partners to work with them to bring the technology to market, Pan added.\"Scientists strive to provide the public with cutting-edge, advanced technologies that enable them to self-diagnose or get diagnosed at the point of care,\" Pan said. \"This is what we have done.\" More information:Parikshit Moitra et al, Nucleotide\u2010Driven Molecular Sensing of Monkeypox Virus Through Hierarchical Self\u2010Assembly of 2D Hafnium Disulfide Nanoplatelets and Gold Nanospheres, Advanced Functional Materials (2023).

With a testing system and patient samples, physicians can investigate potential leads, narrowing down their list of culprits to provide precise, effective treatment for patients.A team led by Florida State University chemists has developed a new test for detecting biological markers related to several types of cancer. Their research was recently published in Journal of the American Chemical Society.\"Better tools for detecting cancer mean more effective treatment for patients,\" said study co-author Hedi Mattoussi, a professor in the FSU Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. \"Our goal in this research was to build a biosensor that would light up in the presence of cancer markers, offering another tool for the ongoing problem of detecting this disease.\"The sensing platform is made of a gold nanoparticle and molecules called peptides that are labeled with a dye. The components are connected by chemical bonds, and the gold nanoparticle keeps the dye from glowing in the presence of UV light.When a patient sample containing the enzyme MMP-14\u2014a biomarker for various types of cancers, but most commonly for breast cancer\u2014is added, it breaks bonds in the peptides, separating a fragment with the dye from the gold. Without the gold to absorb the energy from the dye, the sample begins to glow.\"You start with a system that is dark, which we can think of as 'off,' like we would with a light switch,\" Mattoussi said. \"When you bring in the enzyme, the system turns 'on' and emits light. It is like a beacon.\"The light glowing from the sample depends on the concentration of the enzyme and interaction time. By measuring that light, researchers can generate data that inform them if a cancer marker is present in a sample and in what levels.Various tests already exist for examining whether a patient has cancer. This research is a first step toward developing a method that can test for a wider variety of cancers.Mattoussi and his team tested their system with the MMP-14 enzyme but they plan to expand this research with work that matches more peptide chains with other enzyme cancer markers. With further development, it could allow scientists to use a single assessment to test for a variety of cancers at once.\"The platform we have designed is applicable to any enzyme,\" he said. \"All that you need to do is vary the nature of the peptide that is attached to the nanoparticle. You change the peptide, you change the enzyme, and it works the same way.\"Along with its applications for detecting disease, the research also sheds more light on how enzymes interact with peptides that are attached to nanoparticles and how the addition of enzymes affects the testing system.\"One aspect of our research was the application aspect,\" Mattoussi said. \"Cancer diagnosis is still a huge problem. Early detection has been a limiting factor. But the other aspect of this work was the ability to develop a platform that starts with a nanoparticle attached to a peptide labeled with a dye and understand the way they interact. How efficient are those interactions? What happens when you vary the size of nanoparticles or the number of peptides? So, there is a practical aspect and a fundamental aspect to this research.\" More information:Zhicheng Jin et al, Evaluating the Catalytic Efficiency of the Human Membrane-type 1 Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP-14) Using AuNP\u2013Peptide Conjugates, Journal of the American Chemical Society (2023).

  "text": "The idea of wirelessly gathering electrical information from the body through the skin is not new. However, the ideal electrode material must fulfill a significant list of criteria to be a realistic candidate for use on patients. Researchers from Osaka University have designed an electrode substrate derived from wood that appears to tick all the boxes. Their findings have recently been published in Advanced Materials Interfaces.          The electrodes needed for on-skin electronics are supported by a substrate material that makes effective contact with the skin. Choosing a substrate requires the consideration of numerous factors: Is it flexible and comfortable to wear, but still durable? Can the substrate be sterilized so that it can be reused? Does it stick well to the skin and allow the skin to breathe? Is the substrate environmentally sustainable to produce and dispose of?Finding a candidate is therefore tricky, but the Osaka researchers believe they have designed the most promising one to date. Their cellulose-based material is essentially paper made up of tiny nanofibers, giving it the name \"nanopaper e-skin,\" and it is the gaps between the fibers, whose size can be controlled, that give their substrate the edge.\"To get the best possible electrical signal it is important for a substrate to make good contact with the skin, which means it must be smooth. However, many examples of smooth materials are also very dense which severely reduces their breathability and results in user discomfort,\" says study author Teppei Araki. \"Because our nanopaper is a mesh of very fine fibers, it maintains good contact with the skin, but also has pores meaning that water vapor can pass through, reducing inflammation and making it comfortable to wear,\" explains study first author Yintong Huang.                On-skin EEG, ECG, and EMG signals acquired by attaching the nanopaper-based e-skin on the human skin surface. Credit: Huang et al, Advanced Materials Interfaces, CC BY             Once wet, the nanopaper could stick to skin because of the action of the water in the pores, and it was able to withstand 100 cycles of deformation on the forehead while maintaining function. The nanopaper could also be sterilized at high temperature.\"We believe that our nanopaper offers compatibility with both the body and the environment,\" says senior author Hirotaka Koga. \"The availability, flexibility, skin-conformability and -breathability, thermal stability, toughness, biocompatibility, and environmental sustainability of our substrate all combine to make it a highly promising candidate for electrophysiological monitoring that we expect to easily translate into the clinic for the measurement of data such as ECGs.\"These results provide a very promising step forward in the field of on-skin electronics and may be the jump needed for explosive developments when researchers combine techniques of flexible and sustainable electronics that they have developed.

  "text": "National University of Singapore (NUS) physicists found that contacts made of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten diselenide (WSe2) on gold metal are both p-type, while the same contacts with chalcogen vacancy defects become n-type. Non-local exchange and correlation effects are critical in determining the energy level alignment and the contact polarity. The results of the study, published in npj 2D Materials and Applications, show that the different contact polarities observed experimentally for MoS2/gold and WSe2/gold interfaces stem from the distinct nature of the defects in these two materials.          Nobel laureate Herbert Kroemer had famously observed that \"the interface is the device.\" When two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor materials are put in contact with metals, they form metal-semiconductor interfaces. These interfaces influence parameters such as contact resistance and play a critical role in the performance of the device. Even the nature of the charge carriers is largely determined by these interfaces. If electrons need a lower energy to cross the energy barrier at the interface, the polarity is \"n-type\"; if holes need a lower energy to cross the energy barrier at the interface, the polarity becomes \"p-type.\" Contact polarity is important for the design of device functionalities, such as p-n junctions.A team of researchers led by Associate Professor Quek Su Ying from the Department of Physics, NUS, used state-of-the-art calculations to study two common 2D semiconductor materials known as the transition metal dichalcogenides, MoS2 and WSe2, in contact with gold metal.Prof. Quek said, \"Our calculations showed that both MoS2/gold and WSe2/gold contacts are p-type when there are no defects. These results were different from previous theoretical predictions. The crucial difference is that many-body exchange and correlation effects beyond a mean-field description are important to accurately predict the level alignment. When there is a chalcogen vacancy defect, the contacts become n-type in both cases. This is due to the additional energy levels in the band gap, which cause the energy levels of the metal to be 'pinned.'\"Dr. Keian Noori, the lead author on this work, said, \"Unlike MoS2, the chalcogen vacancy defects in WSe2 are more reactive. Under ambient conditions, oxygen available in the environment can react with these vacancies and remove the states in the band gap, so that the WSe2 material behaves like a pristine material with no defects, which is p-type, as far as contact polarity is concerned.\"Prof. Quek added, \"Although the chalcogen vacancy defects in MoS2 are less reactive, it is conceivable that experimental conditions can be arranged to allow the defects to be similarly 'passivated' by oxygen or other species. This will then provide a route to enable more tunable control of the energy offset at the MoS2/metal contacts. As defects are often inevitable, knowing how to control their impact on key device properties will greatly help to optimize device performance.\" More information:Keian Noori et al, Origin of contact polarity at metal-2D transition metal dichalcogenide interfaces, npj 2D Materials and Applications (2022).

But University of California, Irvine physicists have reported the discovery of nanoscale devices that can transform into many different shapes and sizes even though they exist in solid states.          It's a finding that could fundamentally change the nature of electronic devices, as well as the way scientists research atomic-scale quantum materials. The study is published in Science Advances.\"What we discovered is that for a particular set of materials, you can make nanoscale electronic devices that aren't stuck together,\" said Javier Sanchez-Yamagishi, an assistant professor of physics & astronomy whose lab performed the new research. \"The parts can move, and so that allows us to modify the size and shape of a device after it's been made.\"The electronic devices are modifiable much like refrigerator door magnets\u2014stuck on but can be reconfigured into any pattern you like.\"The significance of this research is that it demonstrates a new property that can be utilized in these materials that allows for fundamentally different types of devices architectures to be realized, including mechanically reconfigure parts of a circuit,\" said Ian Sequeira, a Ph.D. student in Sanchez-Yamagishi's lab.If it sounds like science fiction, said Sanchez-Yamagishi, that's because until now scientists did not think such a thing was possible.Indeed, Sanchez-Yamagishi and his team, which also includes UCI Ph.D. student Andrew Barabas, weren't even looking for what they ultimately discovered.\"It was definitely not what we were initially setting out to do,\" said Sanchez-Yamagishi. \"We expected everything to be static, but what happened was we were in the middle of trying to measure it, and we accidentally bumped into the device, and we saw that it moved.\"What they saw specifically was that tiny nanoscale gold wires could slide with very low friction on top of special crystals called van der Waals materials.Taking advantage of these slippery interfaces, they made electronic devices made of single-atom thick sheets of a substance called graphene attached to gold wires that can be transformed into a variety of different configurations on the fly.Because it conducts electricity so well, gold is a common part of electronic components. But exactly how the discovery could impact industries that use such devices is unclear.\"The initial story is more about the basic science of it, although it is an idea which could one day have an effect on industry,\" said Sanchez-Yamagishi. \"This germinates the idea of it.\"Meanwhile, the team expects their work could usher in a new era of quantum science research.\"It could fundamentally change how people do research in this field,\" Sanchez-Yamagishi said.\"Researchers dream of having flexibility and control in their experiments, but there are a lot of restrictions when dealing with nanoscale materials,\" he added. \"Our results show that what was once thought to be fixed and static can be made flexible and dynamic.\"Other UCI co-authors include Yuhui Yang, a senior undergraduate at UCI, and postdoctoral scholar Aaron Barajas-Aguilar.

  "text": "The twin issues of climate change and the shortage of fossil fuels are two primary challenges of energy research. Polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs), which produce the clean fuel hydrogen, are one of the most promising options to tackle both these challenges.          However, PEFCs are expensive to make and operate, primarily because of the large amount of platinum (Pt) that they require. Moreover, the amount of Pt in the Earth's crust is limited, which means that to make PEFCs truly sustainable, it is imperative to reduce the amount of Pt that they use.Presently, PEFCs use cathodes (the positive electrode) made with Pt nanoparticles (NPs) that are supported on carbon black (Pt NPs/CB). However, recent research has indicated that Pt nanoclusters (Pt NCs) have higher oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity than Pt NPs, i.e., they have higher performance. Thus far, the reason for Pt NCs high ORR activity has been unclear.Recently, a research team led by Professor Yuichi Negishi from Tokyo University of Science (TUS) have developed a novel Pt NC that exhibits 2.1 times higher ORR activity than commercial Pt NPs and elucidated the origin of its high activity.\"In our study, we focused on Pt NCs derived from a Pt, carbon carboxylate (CO), and triphenylphosphine (PPh3) base i.e., [Pt17(CO)12(PPh3)8]z (where z = 1+ or 2+). We recently showed that these Pt NCs, unlike others, are stable in air. We then performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to reveal the reason for its remarkable activity,\" says Prof. Negishi.The research team also included Junior Associate Professor Tokuhisa Kawawaki from Tokyo University of Science, Associate Professor Kenji Iida from Hokkaido University, Professor Toshihiko Yokoyama from Institute for Molecular Science, Japan, and Professor Gregory F. Metha from the University of Adelaide, Australia. The study has been published in the journal Nanoscale on March 24, 2023.The researchers prepared the Pt NCs by the adsorption of [Pt17(CO)12(PPh3)8]z onto carbon black, followed by a calcination reaction. They then compared its performance to conventional Pt NPs/CB using a technique called linear sweep voltammetry. They found that the novel Pt NCs had higher performance than the Pt NPs/CB. Notably, at 0.9 volts, the Pt NCs had 2.1 times higher activity than the Pt NPs/CB. They also found that increasing Pt loading in the electrode leads to an increase in its mass activity, and that the PT NCs had higher durability than the commercial PT NPs/CB.Next, to elucidate the origins of its high activity, they performed DFT calculations. \"Our calculations suggest that the high ORR activity of the novel Pt NCs is due to the surface Pt atoms, which have an electronic structure that is suitable for the progress of ORR,\" reveals Prof. Negishi.These findings can serve as a guideline for the design of future high-activity, high-performance Pt catalysts for use in PEFCs, which will take us one step further towards mitigating climate change and the fossil fuel crisis.

  "text": "Correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) is a powerful tool in bioimaging, as it combines the ability to image living cells over large fields of view with molecular specificity using light microscopy (LM) with the high spatial resolution and ultrastructural information of electron microscopy (EM). To highlight biomolecules of interest and determine their position with high accuracy in CLEM, researchers must ensure they are labeled with probes that are visible both in LM (typically by fluorescence) and in EM (using electron dense material). However, existing probes have a number of drawbacks, including lack of stability under LM (photobleaching) and lack of integrity.          In a new paper published in Light Science & Application, a team of scientists, led by Professor Paola Borri from Cardiff University and Professor Paul Verkade from the University of Bristol, United Kingdom, has developed a new CLEM approach that uses small gold nanoparticles as a single probe visible in both LM and EM with high contrast and photostability, with no need to use fluorescent probes.For LM, they exploited an optical microscope developed in Professor Borri's group. This microscope detects the non-linear optical response of gold nanoparticles, called four-wave mixing (FWM). With this method, the researchers were able to detect individual small gold nanoparticles as single probes of the epidermal growth factor protein in human cancer cells, located with nanometric precision background-free by light microscopy, and correlatively mapped with high accuracy to the corresponding transmission electron microscopy image.Owing to the background-free and photostable FWM response of individual gold nanoparticles, well visible in EM due to their electron dense composition, FWM-CLEM opens new avenues for highly accurate correlative microscopy workflows without the need to use unstable fluorophores or additional fiducial markers, thus greatly simplifying sample preparation protocols.The scientists summarize the operational principle of their FWM microscope as follows: \"In its general form, FWM is a third-order non-linear light-matter interaction phenomenon wherein three light fields interact in a medium to generate a fourth wave. Here, we use a scheme where all light waves have the same center frequency, in resonance with the optical absorption peak of a gold nanoparticle. For excitation and detection, we use a combination of short optical pulses of about 150fs duration, called pump and probe, generated by the same laser source. The detected FWM can be understood as a pump-induced change in the ability of the gold nanoparticle to transmit and scatter light, which manifests as a change in the probe beam scattered by the particle in the presence of the pump.\"FWM detection is remarkably photo-stable and high contrast. With this method we are able to detect individual small (down to 5nm radius) gold nanoparticles inside scattering and auto fluorescing cells and tissues completely free from background, at imaging speeds and excitation powers compatible with live cell imaging, with a sensitivity limited only by photon shot noise. We have also seen that FWM is a sensitive reporter of gold nanoparticle shapes, promising for multiplexing by shape recognition in future applications.\"The researchers conclude, \"FWM-CLEM opens new exciting possibilities for correlative light electron microscopy workflows, overcoming existing limitations with fluorescent probes and/or fiducial markers which are not needed in our method. Generally, we believe that FWM-CLEM will have a widespread impact. For example, combined with existing strategies to label with or even encapsulate gold nanoparticles inside virions, FWM opens the exciting prospect to track single virions over long observation times, background-free and deep inside living cells and tissues, to then pin-point events of interest (e.g. genome release) in the context of the cellular ultrastructure by CLEM.\" More information:Iestyn Pope et al, Correlative light-electron microscopy using small gold nanoparticles as single probes, Light: Science & Applications (2023).

  "text": "Researchers from Tsinghua University synthesized porous yolk-shell NiO nanospheres (PYS-NiO NSs) via a solvothermal and subsequent calcination process of Ni-MOF. As the large specific surface areas and hollow porous nanostructures were conducive to ionic transport, PYS-NiO NSs exhibited a fast coloring/bleaching speed (3.6/3.9 s per one coloring/bleaching cycle) and excellent cycling stability (82% of capacity retention after 3000 cycles). These superior electrochromic (EC) properties indicated that the PYS-NiO NSs was a promising candidate for high performance EC devices.          The team published their work in the journal Particuology.Electrochromic (EC) materials (ECMs) are defined as the materials which have reversible changes in their colors and optical properties (transmittance, reflectance, and absorption) under different external voltages. Over the past decades, ECMs show promising advantages and application prospects in many fields such as smart windows, adaptive camouflage, electronic displays, and energy storage, etc., because of their excellent optical modulation abilities.Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are one of the most important ECMs which have been widely studied. They have many advantages such as rich nanostructure design, simple synthesis process, high security, etc. Among them, nickel oxide (NiO) is an attractive anode ECM and has attracted extensive research interest due to its high optical contrast, high coloring efficiency, low cost, etc.However, NiO-based ECMs still face the challenges of long EC switching times and poor cycling life which are caused by their poor ionic/electronic diffusion kinetics and low electrical conductivity.Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted enormous attention, because of their high porosity and large surface areas, and could be adjusted to achieve different properties by selecting different metal ions and organic bridging ligands.Due to the porosity and long-range orderliness, MOFs can provide fast and convenient channels for small molecules and ions to insert and extract during the transformation process. Therefore, MOFs can be used as effective templates for the preparation of hollow and porous TMOs with high ion transport efficiency, excellent specific capacitance, and electrochemical activities.So the authors proposed a new strategy to design a kind of NiO with hollow and porous structure to obtain excellent EC performance and cyclic stability. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, the authors successfully synthesized MOFs-derived porous yolk-shell NiO nanospheres (PYS-NiO NSs) which exhibited excellent EC performance.Ni-organic framework spheres were prepared by a simple solvothermal method and then converted to PYS-NiO NSs by thermal decomposition. The PYS-NiO NSs exhibited relatively high specific surface areas and stable hollow nanostructures, which not only provided a large contact area between active sites and electrolyte ions in the EC process but also helped the NiO to accommodate large volume changes without breaking.Additionally, the PYS-NiO NSs also shortened the ionic diffusion length and provided efficient channels for transferring electronics and ions. In addition, the coupling with carbon also rendered the PYS-NiO NSs with improved electronic conductivity and obtained better EC performance. The PYS-NiO NSs exhibited a fast coloring/bleaching speed (3.6/3.9 s).The PYS-NiO NSs also exhibited excellent cycling stability (82% of capacity retention after 3000 cycles). These superior EC properties indicate that the PYS-NiO NSs are a promising candidate for high-performance EC devices. The as-prepared PYS-NiO NSs are believed to be a promising candidate for smart windows, displays, antiglare rearview mirrors, etc. More importantly, this work provides a new and feasible strategy for the efficient preparation of ECMs with fast response speed and high cyclic stability.

  "text": "A new rapid test for the early diagnosis of preeclampsia, a potentially life-threatening complication of pregnancy, has been developed by a team of researchers at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). The test is significantly faster and more accurate than current methods.          Preeclampsia is a condition that affects around 4%\u20138% of all pregnancies and is characterized by high blood pressure, protein in the urine and damage to organs such as the kidney and liver in the second half of pregnancy. It can lead to serious complications, or loss of life, for both mother and baby if left untreated.Currently, the diagnosis of preeclampsia involves measuring blood pressure and testing for protein in the urine, along with other clinical signs and symptoms. Adding to the complexity is the fact that preeclampsia is a multifactorial disease with varying symptoms and features, so the diagnosis can be missed or delayed, particularly for those living in rural and remote areas.The new strip-based lateral flow assay uses innovative nanoparticle-based technology to detect the concentration of specific biomarkers present in the blood plasma of women with preeclampsia. The novel protein biomarkers, called FKBPL and CD44, were discovered by Associate Professor Lana McClements.The development of the nanophotonic platform used in the rapid test was led by Distinguished Professor Dayong Jin, director of the UTS Institute for Biomedical Materials and Devices.Associate Professor McClements said the new test can produce results within 15 minutes and is highly sensitive and specific. \"We believe this test has the potential to revolutionize the way preeclampsia is diagnosed and managed,\" she said.The research team conducted a study using clinical samples in collaboration with the Mercy Hospital for Women in Melbourne to validate the effectiveness of the test. They found that the test showed significantly improved sensitivity (90.5% vs. 73.7%) and specificity (100% vs. 92.3%) compared to the most up-to-date method currently available.The study, \"Quantitative Point of Care Tests for Timely Diagnosis of Early-onset Preeclampsia with High Sensitivity and Specificity,\" has just been published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition. First authors, UTS Ph.D. candidate Sahar Ghorbanpour and Dr. Shihui Wen, performed the experiments and developed the prototype.The new test can be performed at the point-of-care, such as a pre-natal clinic or doctor's office. \"This essentially gives clinicians the ability to make immediate and life-saving informed decisions, and not wait 24 hours for the results to come back,\" Associate Professor McClements said.At present, the only known cure for preeclampsia is delivery of the baby, however premature delivery can lead to complications and hospitalization.\"In addition to the new test, the novel biomarkers also show potential as drug and cell therapy targets of emerging treatments for preeclampsia. This offers hope not only for earlier diagnosis, but also for a future cure to this terrible disorder,\" Associate Professor McClements said.The research team is now working to commercialize the test in collaboration with industry partners and hopes to eventually make it widely available to healthcare providers around the world.\"This is a major advance over current methods of diagnosis, which can be unreliable and time-consuming,\" said Associate Professor McClements. \"Our test has the potential to make a real difference for both mothers and babies.\" More information:Sahar Masoumeh Ghorbanpour et al, Quantitative Point of Care Tests for Timely Diagnosis of Early\u2010Onset Preeclampsia with High Sensitivity and Specificity, Angewandte Chemie International Edition (2023).

  "text": "Patients with type 1 diabetes live with a constant risk of hyper- or hypoglycemia. Precisely controlled insulin release could help to improve regulation of their blood sugar levels. Reported in the journal Angewandte Chemie, a research team has now introduced a novel insulin formulation that can be switched on by glucose: Lipid nanoparticle carriers release more or less insulin depending on the blood sugar level.          Insulin levels in plasma are primarily regulated by \u03b2-cells in the pancreas and reflect fluctuations in the blood sugar level. Patients with type 1 diabetes can produce very little or no insulin and require several daily injections of a fast-acting insulin as well as one or two injections of a long-acting insulin to keep their blood sugar at a normal level.Alternatively, they wear an insulin pump that provides continuous infusion. The insulin formulations cannot react to changes in the blood sugar level and thus do not allow for the precise regulation of blood sugar. If an insulin overdose is administered, a meal is missed, or too little carbohydrate consumed before strenuous physical activity, there is increased risk of acute, life-threatening hypoglycemia.Insulin formulations that respond to glucose, mimicking the function of \u03b2-cells, could improve insulin therapy. Various approaches with insulin \"carriers\" made of polymers with incorporated glucose oxidase as a glucose detector suffer from two problems: The polymer carriers are not of uniform molecular weight and glucose oxidase is toxic if released into the body.A Chinese team led by Jinqiang Wang and Zhen Gu at Zhejiang University, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, and the University of Hong Kong chose a different approach based on biocompatible lipid nanoparticles used as carriers with lipids with uniform chemical structures. Lipid nanoparticles are already in wide clinical use as drug carriers.A section of the lipids was modified so that the surfaces of the self-aggregated nanoparticles carry many positive charges. Insulin molecules with a negative charge electrostatically bind to the nanoparticles and are released slowly when the blood sugar level is normal. If the blood sugar level is high, certain lipids in the nanoparticles form chemical bonds with the glucose, reducing the positive charge at the surface and significantly accelerating the release of insulin.In diabetic mice treated with the new insulin formulation, it was possible to maintain a normal blood sugar level for six hours. After injection of glucose, the blood sugar in the treated diabetic mice decreased to a normal level just as rapidly as that of healthy mice.In the future, a combination of this glucose-responsive insulin formulation with a dispensation device controlled by a wearable electronic sugar detector could significantly improve regulation of the blood sugar level in diabetes patients.

  "text": "How can Marvel movie character Ant-Man produce such strong energy out of his small body? The secret lies in the transistors on his suit that amplify weak signals for processing. Transistors that amplify electrical signals in the conventional way lose heat energy and limit the speed of signal transfer, which degrades performance. What if it were possible to overcome such limitations and make a high-performance suit that is light and small but without the loss of heat energy?          A POSTECH team of Professor Kyoung-Duck Park and Yeonjeong Koo from the Department of Physics and a team from ITMO University in Russia led by Professor Vasily Kravtsov jointly developed a nano-excitonic transistor using intralayer and interlayer excitons in heterostructure-based semiconductors, which addresses the limitations of existing transistors. The research was recently published in the journal ACS Nano.Excitons are responsible for light emission of semiconductor materials and are key to developing a next-generation light-emitting element with less heat generation and a light source for quantum information technology due to the free conversion between light and material in their electrically neutral states.There are two types of excitons in a semiconductor heterobilayer, which is a stack of two different semiconductor monolayers: the intralayer excitons with horizontal direction and the interlayer excitons with vertical direction.Optical signals emitted by the two excitons have different lights, durations, and coherence times. This means that selective control of the two optical signals could enable the development of a two-bit exciton transistor. However, it was challenging to control intra- and interlayer excitons in nano-scale spaces due to the non-homogeneity of semiconductor heterostructures and low luminous efficiency of interlayer excitons in addition to the diffraction limit of light.The team in its previous research had proposed technology for controlling excitons in nano-level spaces by pressing semiconductor materials with a nano-scale tip. This time, for the first time ever, the researchers were able to remotely control the density and luminance efficiency of excitons based on polarized light on the tip without directly touching the excitons. The most significant advantage of this method, which combines a photonic nanocavity and a spatial light modulator, is that it can reversibly control excitons, minimizing physical damage to the semiconductor material. Also, a nano-excitonic transistor that uses light can help process massive amounts of data at the speed of light while minimizing heat energy loss.Artificial intelligence (AI) has made inroads into our lives more quickly than we ever expected, and it requires huge volumes of data in order to provide good answers that are actually helpful for users. The ever-increasing volume of information should be collected and processed as more and more fields utilize AI. This research is expected to propose a new data processing strategy befitting an era of data explosion. Yeonjeong Koo, one of the co-first authors of the research paper, said, \"The nano-excitonic transistor is expected to play an integral role in realizing an optical computer, which will help process the huge amounts of data driven by AI technology.\" More information:Yeonjeong Koo et al, Nanocavity-Integrated van der Waals Heterobilayers for Nano-excitonic Transistor, ACS Nano (2023).

  "text": "A research group led by scientists from the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science has developed a unique material, based on nanofillers embedded in a hydrogel, that can channel mechanical energy in one direction but not the other, acting in a \"nonreciprocal\" way.          With this composite material\u2014which can be constructed at various sizes\u2014the team was able to use vibrational up-and-down movements to make liquid droplets rise within a material against gravity. Using this material could thus make it possible to make use of random vibrations and move matter in a preferred direction.The team's research paper is published in the journal Science.Channeling energy in a preferred direction is an important property that actually makes life possible. Many basic biological functions such as photosynthesis and cellular respiration are made possible by channeling random fluctuations in nature in a nonreciprocal way, to drive a system away from increasing entropy, like the famed Maxwell's demon.For example, devices that allow energy to move preferentially are in electronics, where they allow AC current to be transformed into DC current. Similar devices are used in the fields of photonics, magnetism, and sound. However, despite the many potential uses, creating devices that channel mechanical energy has proven to be more difficult.Now, a RIKEN-led group has developed a remarkable but uniform material that is relatively easy to produce and can perform this function. To create it, the group used a hydrogel\u2014a soft material made mainly of water and a polyacrylamide network\u2014and embedded graphene oxide nanofillers into it at a tilted angle. The hydrogel is fixed to the floor, so that the top part can move when subjected to a shear force but not the bottom. The fillers are set at a tilted angle, so that they angle clockwise from top to bottom.When a shear force is applied from right to left into the leaning nanofillers, they tend to buckle and hence lose their resistance. But if the force is from the other direction, and the nanofillers are facing away from it, the applied shear merely makes them stretch even longer, and they maintain their strength. This allows the sheet to deform in one direction but not the other. The group measured this difference, finding that the material was approximately 60 times as resistant in one direction than the other.As an experiment to demonstrate what this could actually do, they created a block of the material and placed it on a vibrating stand. Depending on the tilt direction of the embedded nanofillers, the material was able to channel the vibrational energy through the material to make droplets move to the right or left. They could also use the vibrations to drive a circular motion that could be controlled to be either clockwise or anticlockwise. When setting up the vibrating stand vertically, drops of colored liquid that were placed on the hydrogel moved upward against gravity as if by magic. In this way, alternating vibrational movements, which are usually not of any use, were channeled to create net motion.Finally, as a further test, in collaboration with researchers from the RIKEN Hakubi Fellows program, the group placed Caenorhabditis elegans worms on the material, and although their movements are normally random, they ended up all moving to one side or the another of the hydrogel, depending on the tilt direction of the embedded nanofillers.According to Yasuhiro Ishida of the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science, who led the project, \"It was a remarkable and surprising result, seeing how mechanical energy could be channeled in one direction preferentially, in such a clear way, and using a material that is rather easy to make and quite scalable. In the future, we plan to find applications for this material, with the hope that we can use it to make effective use of vibrational energy, that up until now, has been seen as waste.\" More information:Xiang Wang et al, Mechanical non-reciprocity in a uniform composite material, Science (2023).

In a paper recently published in Advanced Science, Houston Methodist Research Institute researchers used an implantable nanofluidic device they invented to deliver CD40 monoclonal antibodies (mAb), a promising immunotherapeutic agent, at a sustained low-dose via the nanofluidic drug-eluting seed (NDES). The result, found in murine models, was tumor reduction at a fourfold lower dosage than traditional systemic immunotherapy treatment.\"One of the most exciting findings was that even though the NDES device was only inserted in one of two tumors in the same animal model, we noted shrinkage in the tumor without the device,\" said Corrine Ying Xuan Chua, Ph.D., co-corresponding author and assistant professor of nanomedicine at Houston Methodist Academic Institute. \"This means that local treatment with immunotherapy was able to activate the immune response to target other tumors. In fact, one animal model remained tumor-free for the 100-days of continued observation.\"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is frequently diagnosed at advanced stages. In fact, about 85% of patients already have metastatic disease at diagnosis.Immunotherapy holds promise in treating cancers that previously did not have good treatment options. However, because immunotherapy is delivered throughout the entire body, it causes many side effects that are sometimes long-lasting, if not life-long. By focusing the delivery directly into the tumor, the body is protected from being exposed to toxic drugs and fewer side effects, essentially allowing patients undergoing treatment to have a better quality of life.\"Our goal is to transform the way cancer is treated. We see this device as a viable approach to penetrating the pancreatic tumor in a minimally invasive and effective manner, allowing for a more focused therapy using less medication,\" said Alessandro Grattoni, Ph.D., co-corresponding author and chair of the Department of Nanomedicine at Houston Methodist Research Institute.The Houston Methodist researchers are studying similar nanofluidic delivery technology on the International Space Station. Grattoni's nanomedicine lab at Houston Methodist focuses on implantable nanofluidics-based platforms for controlled and long-term drug delivery and cell transplantation to treat chronic diseases.The NDES device consists of a stainless-steel drug reservoir containing nanochannels, thus creating a membrane that allows for sustained diffusion when the drug is released.Other medical technology companies offer intratumoral drug-eluting implants for cancer therapeutics, but those are intended for shorter duration use. The Houston Methodist nanofluidic device is intended for long-term controlled and sustained release, avoiding repeated systemic treatment that often leads to adverse side effects.Additional lab research is underway to determine the effectiveness and safety of this delivery technology, but researchers would like to see this become a viable option for cancer patients in the next five years.Houston Methodist Research Institute collaborators on this study include Hsuan-Chen Liu, Daniel Davila Gonzalez, Dixita Ishani Viswanath, Robin Shae Vander Pol, Shani Zakiya Saunders, Nicola Di Trani, Yitian Xu, Junjun Zheng and Shu-Hsia Chen.

  "answer_squad": " colostrum milk",
  "text": "The intestinal or gut barrier is crucial for nutrient absorption and preventing harmful substances from leaking into the blood stream. Under diseased conditions, the disruption of the gut barrier may increase its permeability and result in a \"leaky gut.\"          The \"leaky gut\" syndrome often comes with symptoms like chronic diarrhea, constipation, or bloating. It has been associated with many diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Both diseases are highly prevalent in the general population, with the latter affecting around 40% of the Singaporean population, while inflammatory bowel disease affects 1-3 in 10,000 Singaporeans. However, treatment options for these two highly common diseases are limited. Repairing the leaky gut is thus a potential strategy for the treatment of these diseases.At the same time, milk, as nature's first functional food, plays essential roles in the development of the intestinal barrier and gut immune system. Both human and bovine milk are rich in extracellular vesicles (mEVs), which are nanosized particles containing beneficial components that can improve gut immunity and quality of gut bacteria.However, it is unclear whether mEVs protect the gut barrier and treat the leaky gut.To this end, Assistant Professor Jiong-Wei Wang from the Nanomedicine Translational Research Programme and Centre for NanoMedicine at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS Medicine), in collaboration with Professor Huaxi Yi from Ocean University of China, led a research team to investigate the potential treatment effects of mEVs on the leaky gut. This study is published in Science Advances.The mEVs are obtained by removing milk fat, proteins and lactose with an in-house approach developed by Asst Prof Wang and his team. They discovered that large amounts of proteins and small nucleic acids carried in mEVs are associated with gut barrier function. The mEVs extracted from both human breast milk and cow milk carry similar therapeutic contents. The treatment efficacy of mEVs was demonstrated in laboratory models.After orally administering mEVs to the models, the researchers observed that their intestinal inflammation was suppressed, and the damaged gut barrier was repaired. More importantly, the mEVs prevented the leakage of gut bacterial toxins into the blood stream, effectively averting toxin-induced liver damage.This illustrates that oral administration of mEVs can potentially heal the leaky gut, and effectively slow down the progression of inflammatory bowel disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\"A leaky gut is a common effect of many diseases. However, whether the leaky gut is a symptom, or a cause of those diseases, remains debatable. Our research shows that treating the leaky gut with mEVs can ameliorate both inflammatory bowel disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, two types of diseases that are seemingly unrelated,\" said Asst Prof Wang, the lead author of this study.\"Another interesting finding is that mEVs extracted from milk produced at different stages after pregnancy\u00becolostrum, transient or mature milk, all exert similar gut barrier protection,\" Asst Prof Wang added.Colostrum milk refers to the milk initially produced by the breast during pregnancy, while transitional milk refers to milk produced 2 to 3 days postpartum. The milk then gradually changes from colostrum to mature milk.According to the research team, a human adult may need to drink 1 liter of milk a day to achieve therapeutic effects on the aforementioned disease conditions. The mEVs are thus more beneficial for individuals with lactose intolerance.Currently, the researchers are exploring the mechanisms underlying the treatment effects. The team is also working with doctors to explore clinical trials with patients in the near future.

  "text": "For mere dollars, a Penn State-led international collaboration has fabricated a self-powered, standalone sensor system capable of monitoring gas molecules in the environment or in human breath. The system combines nanogenerators with micro-supercapacitors to harvest and story energy generated by human movement.          The researchers published their approach, which costs up to just a few dollars for materials and uses widely available equipment, last week in Nano Letters. The development is the culmination of years of work led by corresponding author Huanyu \"Larry\" Cheng, James L. Henderson Jr. Memorial Associate Professor of Engineering Science and Mechanics at Penn State.\"This is a really a combination of previous studies where we've continued the journey of developing wearable gas sensors,\" Cheng said. \"Most sensor research and development centers on the fabrication of device materials. Here, we've used one material to produce multiple components on a single platform that work together as a standalone system.\"Cheng and his team previously developed sensors to detect nitrogen dioxide, which can indicate various pulmonary diseases in exhaled breath, and other gases that may signal poor environmental air quality. They also invented a laser-induced graphene foam material with MXenes, or two-dimensional transition metals that are less reactive than other metals. The novel material and new fabrication method make for a stretchy sensor that can bend with human movements. The researchers also applied this approach to produce stretchable micro-supercapacitors that can store energy produced by those human movements.In this paper, the group combined these efforts. They first applied a laser to previously developed 3D porous graphene foam on a flexible substrate. Next, the researchers sprayed MXenes on the graphene foam and used another laser to combine the foam and MXenes into a nanocomposite material. They then transferred the nanocomposite material to a pre-strained elastomer, which they slowly released. This slow release crumples the nanocomposite, which can be patterned differently for sensors, nanogenerators and micro-supercapacitors.\"Using this laser is almost like toasting a piece of bread: it changes the surface of the bread into something more stable,\" Cheng said, explaining the laser uses carbon dioxide to change the material's surface. \"You end up with a more stable and porous product than what you started with. This material enables more sensitivity in the sensors and more conductivity in the other components.\"                The standalone system converts energy from human movement, like running) to power gas sensors at the mouth and wrist, as well as to send data via Bluetooth.\u00a0Credit: Provided by Huanyu \"Larry\" Cheng/Penn State             The lasers used are available in most machining shops, according to Cheng.\"These materials are cheap, and the more expensive tools are widely available\u2014Penn State alone has hundreds of these lasers,\" said co-corresponding author Cheng Zhang, who is affiliated with Minjang University in China and was a visiting scholar in Cheng's lab. \"With the low-cost and wide availability of materials and tools, this approach could certainly be scaled up for use in the clinical setting.\"With the same nanocomposite material comprising each device, the components of the system work together seamlessly, according to Cheng. Since the 3D nanocomposite foam was pre-strained, creating the \"crumpled\" effect, each component can also be stretched and bent to adhere to human skin or clothing without losing sensitivity.\"The improved electrical conductivity, mechanical robustness and specific surface area of the crumpled porous graphene/MXenes from the simple fabrication provide opportunities for applications in the standalone stretchable device platform,\" Zhang said.To demonstrate proof-of-concept, a research associate wore gas sensors under their nose and on their wrist, as well as nanogenerators on their shoes and an array of micro-supercapacitors on their shirt. The person exercised vigorously, with the nanogenerators harvesting energy produced by their foot movements. That energy was stored by the micro-supercapacitors, which used the power to collect and send data from the gas sensors to a Bluetooth receiver, where the scientists could analyze it. The sensors continuously monitored both exhaled breath and the environment for nitrogen dioxide.\"The measurements were consistent with those made by a commercial sensor,\" Cheng said. He also noted that the system demonstrated stable rates over 50 days in laboratory testing, indicating the long-term stability of the system for real-life applications. \"The design strategies and demonstration from this work pave the way for the design, fabrication and application of next-generation bio-integrated electronics for healthy aging and precisions medicine.\" More information:Cheng Zhang et al, Laser Processing of Crumpled Porous Graphene/MXene Nanocomposites for a Standalone Gas Sensing System, Nano Letters (2023).

  "text": "Electrostatic doping has been widely used in low-dimensional materials, including carbon nanotube (CNT) and two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Unlike conventional lattice doping with impurity atoms, it is challenging to achieve doping in nanoscale materials due to the limited physical space. The electrostatic doping opens an effective pathway to tune the charge carriers in nanoscale materials without introducing impurity atoms, which can perturb the atomic arrangement and degrade the intrinsic electronic properties of the nanoscale materials.          In a new paper published in eLight, a team of scientists led by Professors Sung-Joon Lee and Hung-Chieh Cheng from the University of California Los Angeles has developed a methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3)/2DSC heterojunction device.Recently, ionic solids have been explored for creating a p-n junction in monolayer 2D materials. The frozen mobile ions provide electrostatic fields to modulate the carrier density of underlying 2D semiconducting channel. Due to the well-defined shape of ionic solids, local control of the doping on 2D semiconductors (2DSCs) allows diverse designs to integrate solid-state electronic/optoelectronic devices with minimum crosstalk.The manipulation of silver ions in solid-state superionic silver iodide (AgI) was employed for tailoring the carrier type of 2DSCs to achieve reversibly programmable transistors, diodes, photodiodes and logic gates.The monolayer TMDs have been widely adopted in novel optoelectronic applications such as electrically tunable light-emitting diodes (LEDs), gate-controlled p-n junction diodes, and solar cells. However, the monolayer TMDs exhibit some intrinsic limits for high-performance optoelectronic applications. The incorporation of impurity dopants in the atomically thin 2D lattices has been fundamentally limited by the physical space in the atomically thin lattices.It has been a persistent challenge to tailor the charge doping type/density in monolayer 2DSCs using selected lattice dopants. Consequently, the p-n photodiodes made from 2DSCs are often plagued by non-ideal contacts at either p- or n-side, limiting the achievable open circuit voltage (VOC). Additionally, the total light absorption and spectral sensitivity of 2DSCs are fundamentally limited by their atomically thin geometry. It compromises the photocarrier generation efficiency and the achievable external quantum efficiency (EQE).Considerable efforts have been devoted to overcoming such intrinsic limitations by heterogeneously integrating with other well-known optoelectronic materials. For example, interfacing with organic dye molecules has been demonstrated as an effective strategy to control its optoelectrical properties. Hybrid lead halide perovskites (LHPs) have received substantial attention for photovoltaics due to their excellent optoelectronic performance and low fabrication cost.Despite its extraordinary potential, the \"soft lattice\" ionic LHPs are typically plagued with ion migrations under voltage bias, leading to poor material stability and large hysteresis in the voltage-dependent photocurrents. The migration of positively or negatively charged ions could induce ion accumulation or ionic charge imbalance under applied electric fields. Here, we exploit such ionic charge imbalance in LHPs to induce reversible doping in nearby 2DSCs to create high-performance photodiodes.Methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3) represents the most prominent example of LHPs with excellent optical absorption and photoresponsive properties but is seriously plagued by ionic motion. Although undesirable for stable operation of solar cell applications, the accumulation of ionic charge from the bias-induced ions migration in MAPbI3 can be exploited for selectively doping nearby 2DSCs to create perovskite-sensitized 2D photodiodes with high optoelectronic performance.In this regard, the atomically thin 2DSCs are ideally suited for efficient coupling with the ionic solids. They serve as a non-covalent doping agent to reversibly induce the reconfigurable p-type or n-type doping effect. Such tunable doping effect further offers a new class of 2DSC-based photodiodes with switchable polarities. With van der Waals integration of ionic solids with excellent optoelectronic properties, the 2D diodes formed from the ionic-doping effect provide an efficient way to extract photogenerated carriers in MAPbI3.

Now, he and Ph.D. student Maryam Rezaie have taken what they learned and incorporated it into new ideas for use outside the body.A new study in the journal Small shares the results from using spore-forming bacteria similar to the previous ingestible version to create a device that potentially would still work after 100 years.\"The overall objective is to develop a microbial fuel cell that can be stored for a relatively long period without degradation of biocatalytic activity and also can be rapidly activated by absorbing moisture from the air,\" said Choi, a faculty member in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science.\"We wanted to make these biobatteries for portable, storable and on-demand power generation capabilities,\" Choi said. \"The problem is, how can we provide the long-term storage of bacteria until used? And if that is possible, then how would you provide on-demand battery activation for rapid and easy power generation? And how would you improve the power?\"The dime-sized fuel cell was sealed with a piece of Kapton tape, a material that can withstand temperatures from -500 to 750 degrees Fahrenheit. When the tape was removed and moisture allowed in, the bacteria mixed with a chemical germinant that encouraged the microbes to produce spores. The energy from that reaction produced enough to power an LED, a digital thermometer or a small clock.Heat activation of the bacterial spores cut the time to full power from 1 hour to 20 minutes, and increasing the humidity led to higher electrical output. After a week of storage at room temperature, there was only a 2% drop in power generation.While these are all good results, Choi knows that a fuel cell like this needs to power up more quickly and produce more voltage to become a viable alternative to traditional batteries.\"I think this is a good start,\" he said. \"Hopefully, we can make a commercial product using these ideas.\" More information:Maryam Rezaie et al, Moisture\u2010Enabled Germination of Heat\u2010Activated Bacillus Endospores for Rapid and Practical Bioelectricity Generation: Toward Portable, Storable Bacteria\u2010Powered Biobatteries, Small (2023).

  "answer_race": " A new electron microscopy technique can resolve the antiferromagnetic order in iron arsenide.",
  "question_squad": " What is the term for the phenomenon where atoms behave as miniature magnets?",
  "answer_squad": " ferromagnetism",
  "text": "Permanent magnets, the kind found on refrigerators everywhere, exist because their constituent atoms behave as miniature magnets. They align and combine to form the larger magnet in a phenomenon called ferromagnetism. There are some materials where the atomic magnets instead form an alternating pattern, so the material has no net magnetization. Such antiferromagnets have attracted attention for their potential to create faster and more compact magnetic memory devices for computing.          Realizing the full potential of antiferromagnetic devices will require sensing their atom-to-atom magnetic patterns, something that has not yet been achieved. However, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, led by Pinshane Huang, a professor of materials science & engineering, have made progress toward this goal. In the journal Ultramicroscopy, they report a new electron microscopy technique that can resolve magnetic behavior on the scale of angstroms\u2014tenths of nanometers, nearly on the scale of individual atoms. They use this technique to fully resolve the antiferromagnetic order in iron arsenide for the first time.\"We are working to develop new techniques that can resolve magnetic behavior of individual atoms, and this study is an important step,\" Huang said. \"The best techniques before now have achieved resolutions of a few nanometers. We have vastly exceeded that record.\"Microscopic magnetism is often measured with scanning transmission electron microscopy, or STEM, in which an electron beam is focused into a material. The electric interactions between the beam and the material's structure have been famously used to provide images of individual atoms in the material, but the beam also interacts with the material's magnetic structure.Although this much weaker interaction is enough to determine the longer-range magnetic order found in ferromagnets, a far more precise technique is needed to observe the atom-to-atom variation in antiferromagnets.\"In standard, low-resolution STEM experiments, the magnetic interaction can be understood as a small deflection of the electron beam,\" said Kayla Nguyen, a postdoctoral research associate and co-lead author of the study. \"On the scale of individual atoms, though, this picture breaks down. The magnetic interactions create complicated and subtle signals in the beam pattern which require new tools to analyze and understand.\"To achieve higher resolution, the researchers turned to a more powerful method called four-dimensional STEM. Standard STEM techniques record drops in the beam's intensity as it interacts with the material, but 4D-STEM captures full two-dimensional scattering patterns as the electron beam scans along the two directions of the material's surface (for four-dimensional data). These data allowed the researchers to search the full beam patterns for the more intricate signals of atomic antiferromagnetism.A crucial step of the analysis was simulating the magnetic fields within the iron arsenide sample, for which the researchers wrote a software package called Magnstem. Graduate student and co-lead author Jeffrey Huang explained that the package allowed them to add magnetic effects specific to their material and study the effects they had on electron beam patterns.\"Magnstem simulations allowed us to compare the electron patterns with magnetic effects turned on versus turned off, something that would be quite difficult to do in a real experiment,\" he said. \"We saw that the effects of the magnetic and electric signals occur on different parts of the pattern and can be extracted separately.\"By combining 4D-STEM with Magnstem simulations, the researchers resolved magnetic order down to 6 angstroms. While this does not resolve magnetic effects on the scale of individual atoms, it allowed them to resolve the antiferromagnetic pattern of iron arsenide, which repeats in cells of 12 atoms.\"Our work has shown it is possible to resolve small-scale magnetic order in electron microscopy experiments and in simulations, almost at atomic resolution,\" Pinshane Huang said. \"We are actively developing techniques that will build on this result.\"The researchers worked in collaboration with the research groups of Daniel Shoemaker and Andr\u00e9 Schleife, both professors of materials science & engineering. Shoemaker's group produced samples of iron arsenide, and Schleife's group performed simulations of the material's magnetic structure. More information:Kayla X.

  "text": "Carbon nanotubes not only shine brighter in the presence of dopamine, but also for longer. The time period of the shining serves as a new parameter to detect biological messenger substances.          An interdisciplinary research team from Bochum and Duisburg has found a new way to detect the important neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain. The researchers used carbon nanotubes for this purpose. In earlier studies, the team led by Professor Sebastian Kruss had already shown that the tubes glow brighter in the presence of dopamine. Now the interdisciplinary group showed that the duration of the glow also changes.\"This is the first time that such an important messenger substance as dopamine has been detected in this way,\" says Sebastian Kruss. \"We are confident that this will open up a new platform that will also enable better detection of other human messenger substances such as serotonin.\" The work was a collaboration between Kruss' two research groups in physical chemistry at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, and the Fraunhofer Institute for Microelectronic Circuits and Systems (IMS).The results are described by a team around Linda Sistemich and Sebastian Kruss from Ruhr University Bochum together with colleagues from the IMS and the University of Duisburg-Essen in the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition, published online on March 9, 2023.With dopamine, the nanotubes shine brighter and longerThe sensors used are tubes made of carbon that are 100,000 times thinner than a human hair. If they are irradiated with visible light, they can even emit light in the near-infrared range, at a wavelength of 1,000 nanometers, which is not visible to humans.Previous studies led by Sebastian Kruss had shown that certain carbon nanotubes modified with biopolymers glow brighter when they come into contact with certain biomolecules such as dopamine. In the new study, the researchers observed how long it takes for the nanotubes to emit this light in the near-infrared. To do this, the researchers observed the emitted light as individual light particles.Using a stopwatch, they recorded the time it took for the light particles to travel from the moment the nanotube was irradiated to the moment the light particles were released by the nanotube. \"We need special stopwatches to measure such a time span, because the emission of light is 100 million times faster than the blink of a human eye,\" Linda Sistemich clarifies.This so-called lifetime of light is characteristic for different substances and represents a more robust signal compared to brightness. While the brightness depends on how many layers of cells the light has to pass through before it can be measured, this does not affect the lifetime of the light. Because each individual light particle carries the information about the lifetime, each measured particle is an increase in information, regardless of how many particles are measured.\"This is particularly advantageous if, like us, you not only measure in simple aqueous solutions, but also in complicated environments such as in cell culture or in the organism itself,\" explains Sebastian Kruss, who heads the Functional Interfaces and Biosystems group at Ruhr University and is a member of the Cluster of Excellence Ruhr Explores Solvation (RESOLV) and the International Graduate School of Neuroscience. In this work, dopamine release from single cells was recorded. However, the method is also applicable to networks of cells or organisms.The detected dopamine is an important messenger substance in the human brain through which the cells communicate with each other. Dopamine not only controls the reward center, but is also the driving force for movement, coordination, concentration and mental performance. When too little dopamine is released, movement disorders and declining memory can occur\u2014symptoms that are present, for example, in Parkinson's disease.

Daniel Voignac and colleagues propose a mosquito bite prevention method based on cellulose, an abundant biological molecule, readily available in wood industry waste, as well as local food and paper waste.

  "text": "EPFL researchers have used a nanoplasmonics approach to observe the real-time production of cell secretions, including proteins and antibodies; an advancement that could aid in the development of cancer treatments, vaccines, and other therapies.          Cell secretions like proteins, antibodies, and neurotransmitters play an essential role in immune response, metabolism, and communication between cells. Understanding cell secretions is key for developing disease treatments, but current methods are only able to report the quantity of secretions, without any detail as to when and where they are produced.Now, researchers in the BIOnanophotonic Systems Laboratory (BIOS) in the School of Engineering and at the University of Geneva have developed a novel optical imaging approach that gives a four-dimensional view of cell secretions in both space and time. By placing individual cells into microscopic wells in a nanostructured gold-plated chip, and then inducing a phenomenon called plasmonic resonance on the chip's surface, they are able to map secretions as they are being produced, while observing cell shape and movement.As it provides an unprecedentedly detailed view of how cells function and communicate, the scientists believe their method, recently published in Nature Biomedical Engineering, has \"tremendous\" potential for pharmaceutical development as well as fundamental research.\"A key aspect of our work is that it allows us to screen cells individually in a high-throughput fashion. Collective measurements of the average response of many cells do not reflect their heterogeneity\u2026and in biology, everything is heterogeneous, from immune responses to cancer cells. This is why cancer is so hard to treat,\" says BIOS head Hatice Altug.Credit: Ecole Polytechnique Federale de LausanneA million sensing elementsAt the heart of the scientists' method is a 1 cm2 nanoplasmonic chip composed of millions of tiny holes, and hundreds of chambers for individual cells. The chip is made of a nanostructured gold substrate covered with a thin polymer mesh. Each chamber is filled with a cell medium to keep the cells alive and healthy during imaging.\"Cell secretions are like the words of the cell: they spread out dynamically in time and space to connect with other cells. Our technology captures key heterogeneity in terms of where and how far these 'words' travel,\" says BIOS Ph.D. student and first author Saeid Ansaryan.The nanoplasmonics part comes in thanks to a light beam, which causes the gold electrons to oscillate. The nanostructure is engineered so that only certain wavelengths can penetrate it. When something\u2014like protein secretion\u2014occurs on the chip's surface to alter the light passing through, the spectrum shifts. A CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) image sensor and an LED translate this shift into intensity variations on the CMOS pixels.\"The beauty of our apparatus is that the nanoholes distributed across the entire surface transform every spot into a sensing element. This allows us to observe the spatial patterns of released proteins irrespective of cell position,\" says Ansaryan.The method has allowed the scientists to get a glimpse of two essential cellular processes\u2014cell division and cell death\u2014and to study delicate antibody-secreting human donor B-cells.\"We saw the cell content released during two forms of cell death, apoptosis and necroptosis. In the latter, the content is released in an asymmetric burst, resulting in an image signature or fingerprint. This has never before been shown at the single-cell level,\" Altug says.

Credit: BIOS EPFL             Screening for cell fitnessBecause the method bathes the cells in a nutritious cell medium, and does not require the toxic fluorescent labels used by other imaging technologies, the cells under study can easily be recovered. This gives the method great potential for use in developing pharmaceutical drugs, vaccines, and other treatments; for example, to help researchers understand how cells respond to different therapies at the individual level.\"As the amount and pattern of secretions produced by a cell are a proxy for determining their overall effectiveness, we could also imagine immunotherapy applications where you screen patient immune cells to identify those that are most effective, and then create a colony of those cells,\" says Ansaryan.

  "text": "The rapidly advancing field of nanophononics focuses on the study of hypersound, which are acoustic waves in the gigahertz to terahertz range, at the nanoscale. These high-frequency acoustic vibrations, also known as acoustic phonons, have the potential to revolutionize various industries, including materials science, medical imaging, data processing, and quantum technologies.          For instance, the strong interaction between acoustic phonons, light, and electrons in matter at the nanoscale presents a significant opportunity for advancements in optoelectronics. However, manipulating hypersound has been challenging, in part due to the expensive methods required to fabricate high-quality devices with atomic flat interfaces that can confine these waves.A team of researchers at the Center de Nanosciences et de Nanotechnologies\u2014C2N (CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay) led by Dr. Daniel Lanzillotti-Kimura and Dr. Galo Soler-Illia (Instituto de NanoSistemas, Universidad Nacional de San Martin, Argentine), has addressed this challenge in an experimental work published in the journal Photoacoustics by using mesoporous thin films to manipulate hypersound. Mesoporous materials based on silica and titania have a regular pattern of pores with sizes approximately ten thousand times smaller than the diameter of a human hair, and rely on more affordable fabrication methods.In this study, the researchers fabricated mesoporous thin films using a sol-gel process. They then used ultrafast laser spectroscopy to generate, detect and study the properties of the confined phonons. \"The striking element of this work is that, although the pore sizes are comparable to the acoustic wavelengths, the mesoporous thin films are still capable to sustain the acoustic vibrations,\" said Daniel Lanzillotti-Kimura.The study has far-reaching implications, and the researchers are now exploring the potential applications of their findings. Specifically, mesoporous materials are susceptible to infiltration of liquids and gases, which changes their optical and acoustic properties. \"Our next step is to explore the liquid infiltration capability of mesoporous materials for use in practical applications, such as sensing,\" said Edson Cardozo de Oliveira, leading author of the published work.\"We believe that this research will lead to the development of new and innovative technologies that will have a significant impact on various industries.\" The team's findings are a significant contribution to the field of nanoacoustics, and the research has the potential to pave the way for exciting developments in the future.

PVPON5 is a short, five-monomer hydrophilic polymer block, and PDMS30 is a longer, 30-monomer, hydrophobic polymer block within the triblock copolymer.Breast cancer is one of the most common cancer diseases, and global rates of death are still high. Systemic drugs or therapeutic antibodies are current therapies, but they are often associated with heart damage and dysfunction. Image-guided drug delivery to a solid tumor could allow effective drug activity with reduced drug toxicity.\"To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first example of a chelator-free-radiolabeled polymersome capable of a long-term multiday PET imaging study in vivo,\" said Lapi, director of the UAB Cyclotron Facility and a professor in the UAB Department of Radiology. \"The radiolabeling approach developed herein can potentially provide stable binding of a wide spectrum of isotopes without radiometal leaching from the vesicle membrane in vivo. Notably, this approach integrates the inherent advantages of a polyphenolic polymersome membrane with the benefit of quickly anchoring breast cancer cell-targeting ligands.\"      In the study, TA on the polymersome bound 89Zr4+ radionuclide through nonspecific ionic pairing, and the TA also bound the trastuzumab monoclonal antibody, or Tmab, through hydrogen bonding and ionic pairing. There was excellent retention of the 89Zr for up to seven days, as confirmed by PET scans in healthy mice.\"The noncovalent Tmab anchoring to the polymersome membrane can be highly advantageous for nanoparticle modification compared to currently developed covalent methods, as it allows easy and quick integration of a broad range of targeting proteins,\" Kharlampieva said. \"Given the ability of these polymersomes to encapsulate and release anticancer therapeutics, they can be further expanded as precision-targeted therapeutic carriers for advancing human health through highly effective drug-delivery strategies.\"One hour of incubating the TA-polymersomes in a solution of 89Zr-oxalate led to radiolabeling yields of 97 percent, and those yields remained consistent over one, three and seven days. The labeled polymersomes were not cytotoxic when incubated in vitro with two lines of cancer cells up to four days. Furthermore, binding of 89Zr to polymersomes with Tmab already attached also had high yields of 97 percent and stability through seven days. These binding yields are sufficiently high for clinical use, the UAB researchers say.Next, the stable retention of the 89Zr on the TA-polymersomes was demonstrated indirectly in mice.The biodistribution of free 89Zr radiotracer has been previously reported to localize largely in the spine and femurs of animals due to chelation of the zirconium with phosphate moieties in the bone. The UAB researchers found that, when free 89Zr was injected into mice, nearly all of it was located in the femur bones after 24 hours, as measured by a PET scan. A greatly different biodistribution was seen when 89Zr-TA-polymersomes were injected into mice. Negligible radioactivity was found in bones; instead, nearly all the radioactivity was in the spleen and liver. That location represents the known expected clearance of nanovesicles through the mononuclear phagocyte system for nanomaterials larger than 6 to 8 nanometers.\"The observed drastic difference between the biodistribution of the free 89Zr and the metal radiotracer-labeled vesicle is important, as it demonstrates an unimpeded capability of the polymeric nanocarrier to be tracked in vivo,\" Lapi said.The strong imaging contrast in the mice was retained through seven days, further evidence of tight retention of the 89Zr on the TA-polymersomes.The ability of the 89Zr-Tmab-TA-polymersomes to target HER2-positive cancer cells was shown in vitro by differential binding of the nanovesicles to HER2-positive breast cancer cells versus HER2-negative cells. The researchers say further testing to target breast cancer tumors in animals is warranted.Co-first authors of the study, \"Direct radiolabeling of trastuzumab-targeting triblock copolymer vesicles with 89Zr for positron emission tomography imaging,\" are Veronika Kozlovskaya, UAB Department of Chemistry, and Maxwell Ducharme, UAB Department of Radiology.Other co-authors with Kharlampieva, Lapi, Kozlovskaya and Durcharme are Maksim Dolmat and James M.

  "text": "Engineers at Duke University have produced the world's first fully recyclable printed electronics that replace the use of chemicals with water in the fabrication process. By bypassing the need for hazardous chemicals, the demonstration points down a path industry could follow to reduce its environmental footprint and human health risks.          The research appeared online Feb. 28 in the journal Nano Letters.One of the dominant challenges facing any electronics manufacturer is successfully securing several layers of components on top of each other, which is crucial to making complex devices. Getting these layers to stick together can be a frustrating process, particularly for printed electronics.\"If you're making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, one layer on either slice of bread is easy,\" explained Aaron Franklin, the Addy Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke, who led the study. \"But if you put the jelly down first and then try to spread peanut butter on top of it, forget it, the jelly won't stay put and will intermix with the peanut butter. Putting layers on top of each other is not as easy as putting them down on their own\u2014but that's what you have to do if you want to build electronic devices with printing.\"In previous work, Franklin and his group demonstrated the first fully recyclable printed electronics. The devices used three carbon-based inks: semiconducting carbon nanotubes, conductive graphene and insulating nanocellulose. In trying to adapt the original process to only use water, the carbon nanotubes presented the largest challenge.To make a water-based ink in which the carbon nanotubes don't clump together and spread evenly on a surface, a surfactant similar to detergent is added. The resulting ink, however, does not create a layer of carbon nanotubes dense enough for a high current of electrons to travel across.\"You want the carbon nanotubes to look like al dente spaghetti strewn down on a flat surface,\" said Franklin. \"But with a water-based ink, they look more like they've been taken one-by-one and tossed on a wall to check for doneness. If we were using chemicals, we could just print multiple passes again and again until there were enough nanotubes. But water doesn't work that way. We could do it 100 times and there'd still be the same density as the first time.\"An inkjet printer puts down layers of carbon-based electronic inks to create transistors that can be fully recycled using only water, rather than requiring harsh, toxic chemicals. Credit: Jason Arthurs PhotographyThis is because the surfactant used to keep the carbon nanotubes from clumping also prevents additional layers from adhering to the first. In a traditional manufacturing process, these surfactants would be removed using either very high temperatures, which takes a lot of energy, or harsh chemicals, which can pose human and environmental health risks. Franklin and his group wanted to avoid both.In the paper, Franklin and his group develop a cyclical process in which the device is rinsed with water, dried in relatively low heat and printed on again. When the amount of surfactant used in the ink is also tuned down, the researchers show that their inks and processes can create fully functional, fully recyclable, fully water-based transistors.Compared to a resistor or capacitor, a transistor is a relatively complex computer component used in devices such as power control or logic circuits and sensors. Franklin explains that by demonstrating a transistor first, he hopes to signal to the rest of the field that there is a viable path toward making some electronics manufacturing processes much more environmentally friendly.Franklin has already proven that nearly 100% of the carbon nanotubes and graphene used in printing can be recovered and reused in the same process, losing very little of the substances or their performance viability. Because nanocellulose is made from wood, it can simply be recycled or biodegraded like paper. And while the process does use a lot of water, it's not nearly as much as what is required to deal with the toxic chemicals used in traditional fabrication methods.According to a United Nations estimate, less than a quarter of the millions of pounds of electronics thrown away each year is recycled. And the problem is only going to get worse as the world eventually upgrades to 6G devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to expand. So any dent that could be made in this growing mountain of electronic trash is important to pursue.While more work must be done, Franklin says the approach could be used in the manufacturing of other electronic components like the screens and displays that are now ubiquitous to society. Every electronic display has a backplane of thin-film transistors similar to what is demonstrated in the paper. The current fabrication technology is high-energy and relies on hazardous chemicals as well as toxic gasses. The entire industry has been flagged for immediate attention by the US Environmental Protection Agency.\"The performance of our thin-film transistors doesn't match the best currently being manufactured, but they're competitive enough to show the research community that we should all be doing more work to make these processes more environmentally friendly,\" Franklin said.

  "text": "Hydrogen is considered an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional fossil fuels. Until now, expensive and rare substances such as platinum have been needed for its catalytic production, for example via electrolytic water splitting. More readily available catalysts could make the production of large quantities possible in the future.          The research teams of Helmut C\u00f6lfen (Physical Chemistry) and Peter Nielaba (Statistical and Computational Physics) at the University of Konstanz have developed a general method to produce two-dimensional nanoparticles from readily accessible materials, together with researchers from the Ocean University of China, Qingdao (China) and the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society, Berlin (Germany).Two-dimensional nanoparticles have a high catalytic potential, which is why this synthetic route is suitable for producing particularly active catalysts.The corresponding synthesis process is carried out in a simple aqueous solution. No toxic additives or particularly high temperatures, which are energetically unfavorable, are required. The process is controlled by simply varying the concentration of the components and by temperature regulation. The research team succeeded in shaping more than 30 different compounds into two-dimensional forms using this method, which has been described now for the first time in the journal Nature Synthesis.The advantage of two-dimensional nanoparticlesTwo-dimensional (2D) nanoparticles have a particularly large number of surface atoms, which have different properties than atoms within a particle. The bonds of the surface atoms are non-saturated because the surface lacks the immediate neighboring atoms to which bonds are formed inside the particle. This leads to surface or interfacial tension. Since this non-saturated state is quite energy consuming for the overall system, nanoparticles try to cluster together to saturate the bonds and minimize the surface area.However, if the surface bonds remain unsaturated, this results in increased chemical reactivity. The number of unsaturated bonds is particularly high in two-dimensional nanoparticles because they have unsaturated bonds not only at the top and bottom, but also at the sides and edges. This makes them particularly interesting for catalysis, which plays a major role in chemistry. However, the required nanocrystals are difficult to fabricate because of the unfavorable energy state at the surface.Two-dimensional nanoparticles are anisotropic, and their properties depend on the orientation of their building blocks. The crystal lattice of the particles is decisive for their growth direction. If the nanoparticles have a layered crystal lattice as in clay, the particles grow two-dimensionally. However, materials that are favorable for catalysis rarely adopt the two-dimensional shape on their own.If the crystal lattice dictates that the crystal grows rapidly along two crystal axes, two-dimensional nanoparticles can be easily synthesized. Then, only a few molecular building blocks are needed in the solution to grow the nanoparticles two-dimensionally. If the crystals grow in other directions just as fast or only slightly slower, the crystals take on a three-dimensional shape.      How nanoparticles grow two-dimensionallyThe research team has discovered how the concentration of molecular building blocks in the solution can be used to manipulate this process: If the concentration of building blocks is increased, the principle of \"what grows fast also consumes more material\" comes into play: The distance between the fast-growing and the slower growing crystal axes increases, resulting in two-dimensional particles.The method of increasing the building block concentration does not work if the growth rate along different relevant crystal axes is approximately the same. In this case, the researchers use another parameter. The growth rate of crystal surfaces depends exponentially on temperature. If the temperature of the solution is changed by even a few degrees, the difference in the growth rate between the slow and fast-growing crystal faces will increase. As a result, the nanoparticles grow in two dimensions.Method works for over 30 elements of the periodic tableThis general procedure works for many materials. In the periodic table, the German-Chinese research team was able to identify metals in many groups, more than 30 in total, which take the two-dimensional form as oxides or hydroxides, but also acids, sulfides, oxychlorides and phosphates. The advantage of this general approach, which has been described for the first time: In most cases, the materials are produced at room temperature in water\u2014without toxic solvents or high temperatures.Moreover, the yield of catalytic materials is highly scalable. In the lab, the researchers are working on a multigram scale. To produce catalysts in large quantities using easily accessible substances, all that is needed is a sealed vessel\u2014instead of special apparatuses such as pressure vessels.Experiments confirm theoryThe experimental study also shows how theoretical knowledge can be put into practice. The experiments confirm theoretical simulations performed by Peter Nielaba's team in a joint project with the C\u00f6lfen team in the Collaborative Research Centre 1214 \"Anisotropic Particles as Building Blocks: Tailoring Shape, Interactions and Structures\" at the University of Konstanz.The physicist had already taken into account variations in the concentration of the components and the temperature. \"The calculations and what we have found experimentally completely coincides,\" concludes Helmut C\u00f6lfen.The work is published in the journal Nature Synthesis.

  "text": "Think about how frustrating it is to try to fit a gift into a box that is too small. Sometimes you just need a bigger box.          Nanocages are tiny artificial containers that can be used to deliver therapeutics to a target destination in the body. But some drug molecules are like gifts that are too big for a standard-sized nanocage \"box.\" Now, in an article published today (April 6) in Nature Synthesis, researchers from the University of Cambridge describe how they have built a super-sized nanocage that could be used to deliver larger drug cargoes.Simple building blocksRational control over the self-assembly of these types of cages generally poses considerable challenges. So instead of following traditional self-assembly methods, the team decided to use a simple building block process inspired by natural biological systems. Using the new method, they were able to build progressively larger artificial nanocages, with the largest cage having an enclosed volume greater than 92 cubic nanometers\u2014the largest ligand-enclosed inner cavity volume ever made.Larger cages have been reported, but they have more open ligand frameworks, which are not as useful because these cages have not been able to bind cargoes. Prospective \"guest\" molecules slip out between the widely-spaced bars, unless they are covalently tethered to the \"host\" framework.First author Dr. Kai Wu, a postdoctoral researcher in the Nitschke lab in the Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, said, \"The findings of this study are important because they demonstrate how we are able to create ever-larger complex, functional structures using simple building blocks.\"Larger cargoesThe super-sized nanocages have potential applications in fields such as drug delivery and biotechnology, where they could be used to deliver larger therapeutic biomolecules to specific parts of the body.The researchers also note that the large internal cavities of the nanocages could serve as a platform for the binding of large biomolecules, such as hydrophobic membrane proteins or proteases, which could be useful in drug discovery and development.Wu said, \"Overall, this research expands our understanding of how to create nanoscale structures and may have practical implications in a variety of fields.\"Professor Jonathan Nitschke, who led the research, said, \"This work, sponsored in part by Astex Pharmaceuticals under its Sustaining Innovation Postdoctoral Program, aims to have real-world impact in the field of new drug development.\" More information:Jonathan Nitschke, Systematic construction of progressively larger capsules from a fivefold linking pyrrole-based subcomponent, Nature Synthesis (2023).

  "text": "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have become a mainstay of the field of nanotechnology. Finding innovative applications across materials science, electronics, and medicine, CNTs have garnered a lot of attention from researchers in recent years. However, the International Chemical Secretariat (ChemSec) has moved to flag CNTs on the \"Substitute It Now!\" database of chemicals likely to be restricted for use. In fact, due to their persistence in nature and potential toxicity to humans, ChemSec has proposed that adequate assessments of CNTs' risk to human health are urgently needed.          Following their entry into the body, and much like asbestos, CNTs are targeted by the immune system and preferentially engulfed by macrophages. The ensuing inflammatory response\u2014involving inflammasome and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) secretion\u2014can progress to chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and even mesothelioma, as seen in rodent models. Unfortunately, how human macrophages recognize CNTs has remained a mystery.Now, a team of researchers in Japan have found that extracellular receptors, namely, sialic acid immunoglobulin-like binding lectin (Siglec)-5 and -14, are involved in CNT recognition by human macrophages. The team, which included Professor Masafumi Nakayama from Ritsumeikan University, built upon their previous work that confirmed how mouse T-cell mucin immunoglobulin 4 (Tim4) receptors bound to CNTs via an aromatic-aromatic interface.The findings from this study have been published in Nature Nanotechnology. \"We hypothesized that aromatic clusters were essential to CNT recognition. But at the time, it wasn't evident that Tim4 receptors had a role in CNT engulfment by human macrophages,\" says Prof. Nakayama of his motivation for the study.The group used three-dimensional protein-structure-based in silico screening and ectopic in vivo expression of Siglec-14 receptors to validate how the aromatic rings facilitated the Siglec-CNT interaction. Via molecular dynamics simulations, the team discovered the interaction of aromatic residues on the extracellular loop of Siglec-5 and CNTs. On the other hand, they found that Siglec-14 initiated the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) pathway-dependent phagocytosis of CNTs and the release of IL-1\u03b2 by macrophages. The detection of CNTs was enhanced in mouse macrophages expressing human Siglec-14, and importantly, the team noticed that this interaction greatly exacerbated pulmonary inflammation.Lastly, the drug fostamatinib, which is a Syk inhibitor, was seen to block the Siglec-14-mediated proinflammatory signal cascade. \"This is an encouraging result as this drug may overcome CNT-induced inflammation,\" says Prof. Nakayama as he elaborates on the significance of the teams' work.While the team is excited about their breakthrough, they are cautious to note that these findings do not mean CNTs have asbestos-like toxicity. Estimating the toxicity of CNTs would depend on a host of other variables: the route of exposure, the CNT dose received, and the size and shapes of the CNTs involved. At this stage, more detailed studies are required to accurately gauge the risk posed to humans.However, Prof. Nakayama takes pride in knowing that his team have laid the groundwork to help develop safer CNTs. He concludes, \"Even if CNTs are likely to cause inflammatory diseases, our findings will help develop novel therapies, like anti-Siglec-14 monoclonal antibodies and fostamatinib, to prevent such conditions.\" More information:Kota Kasahara, Carbon nanotube recognition by human Siglec-14 provokes inflammation, Nature Nanotechnology (2023).

  "text": "National University of Singapore (NUS) physicists have discovered a novel form of ferroelectricity in a single-element bismuth monolayer that can produce regular and reversible dipole moments for future applications of non-volatile memories and electronic sensors.          Ferroelectricity refers to the phenomenon of certain materials exhibiting a spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by applying an external electric field. Ferroelectric materials are characterized by a crystal structure that lacks a center of symmetry.Due to the potential applications for data storage, ferroelectric materials have attracted widespread research attention. Additionally, their piezoelectric, thermoelectric and nonlinear optical properties have been extensively studied in research areas such as renewable energy, micro-electro-mechanical systems and optical devices.In recent years, two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric materials have emerged as a new contender in the field of neuromorphic synapse devices, displaying the advantage of low dimensionality. However, the development of 2D ferroelectric materials is still limited due to the small number of available materials.Ferroelectricity commonly occurs in compounds composed of multiple constituent elements, where the gain and loss of electrons between the constituents promotes the formation of positive and negative ions in the crystal. Regular atom distortion or charge ordering between sublattices leads to the breaking of the central symmetry, thus promoting the formation of ferroelectric polarization.Recently, a research team led by Professor Andrew Wee from the Department of Physics under the NUS Faculty of Science, made a breakthrough discovery of the single-element ferroelectric state in 2D black phosphorus-like bismuth (BP-Bi), overturning the traditional understanding of ferroelectricity mentioned above.By using optimized scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) techniques, the researchers did a detailed observation of the centrosymmetry-breaking on the atomic structure and charge transfer between sublattices in BP-Bi. For the first time, the single-element ionicity, single-element in-plane polarization and single-element ferroelectricity were all demonstrated in the bismuth monolayer experimentally. This discovery changes the concept that ionic polarization only exists in compounds with cations and anions, and expands the scope of ferroelectricity development in the future.      This work is undertaken in collaboration with Professor Lan Chen from the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Professor Yunhao Lu from the School of Physics, Zhejiang University. The findings were published in Nature on April 5, 2023.The researchers prepared the high-quality BP-Bi on the Van der Waals graphite surface so that the monolayer BP-Bi is intact and flat enough for the measurements. Taking advantage of the high spatial resolution of nc-AFM, the buckling atomic configuration (Dh\u22600) of BP-Bi, as well as the charge redistribution between the two sublattices were determined by AFM imaging and Kelvin probe microscopy (KPFM) measurements. Thereafter, a regular in-plane dipole arrangement is confirmed in the BP-Bi monolayer. In comparison, single layer phosphorous (phosphorene) has no buckling in each sub-layer\u2014therefore it is centrosymmetric and nonpolarized. Then, polarization switching of BP-Bi is realized by using the in-plane electric field produced by the STM tip, which is the basis for writing on the non-volatile memory devices.Ferroelectricity relative to magnetism is advantageous for its manipulation by only the electric field. This makes it more suitable to be contained in integrated circuit devices. Many studies found that it is possible to manipulate other material attributes by coupling ferroelectricity with these properties. In BP-Bi, the buckling degree of atomic structure determines the ferroelectric polarization and, at the same time, controls the basic band structure. This results in an interlock between the electronic structure and ferroelectric polarization. This new type of ferroelectricity offers a promising way to modulate the electronic structure of materials by an external electric field through ferroelectric distortion.Dr. Jian Gou, the lead author for the research paper, said, \"Other research has also shown that BP-Bi exhibits topologically nontrivial states at a specific buckling height, suggesting a potential opportunity for tuning topological states through an electric field.\"In fact, the polarization characteristics have a critical impact on the basic optical and electrical properties of materials. The discovery of single-element ferroelectric polarization adds a new viewpoint to the study of the basic physical properties of elementary substances.Prof Wee said, \"In addition to overturning the common-sense idea that ionic polarization only exists in compounds, we believe that single-element ferroelectricity in BP-Bi would introduce a new perspective to the study and design of novel ferroelectric materials, and inspire new physics of elemental materials in the future.\" More information:Jian Gou et al, Two-dimensional ferroelectricity in a single-element bismuth monolayer, Nature (2023).

  "text": "Superatomic molecules containing noble metal elements like gold and silver are studied for their potential in the synthesis of superatomic materials. However, the understanding of silver-based superatomic molecules has been limited. Addressing this gap, researchers from Japan studied two bimetallic superatomic molecules with silver as a main constituent to determine the key factors that enabled their formation. Their findings are expected to advance the development of novel materials in the future.          In the past few decades, metal nanoclusters composed of noble metal elements such as gold (Au) and silver (Ag) have gained attention as superatoms for the synthesis of materials with unique properties and potential new applications. These superatoms (also known as \"artificial atoms\") typically consist of a cluster of a few to several hundred atoms and exhibit properties that are significantly different from their bulk, conventional counterparts. However, much like real atoms, the stability of these superatoms is determined by the formation of a closed-shell electron structure.Ag-based superatoms are known for their superior properties and functions, including photoluminescence and selective catalytic activity, compared to those of Au-based superatoms. However, most of the research in this field has been primarily focused on Au-based superatomic molecules.To overcome this research gap, researchers from Japan studied the formation of superatomic molecules composed of Ag and evaluated the factors involved in this formation. This study was published in the journal Communications Chemistry on March 28, 2023.Speaking of the motivation behind studying Ag-based superatoms, Prof. Negishi says, \"So far, we humans have created a variety of useful materials from the elements available to us on Earth. However, looking at a future with complex energy and environmental issues, the development of materials with new properties and functions is desired.\"To this end, the researchers synthesized two di-superatomic molecules with bromine (Br) as the bridging ligand: ([Ag23Pt2(PPh3)10Br7]0 and [Ag23Pd2(PPh3)10Br7]0 (PPh3 = Triphenylphosphine). The former consisted of two icosahedral Ag12Pt superatoms connected by vertex sharing with platinum atoms (Pt) occupying the central position in each superatom. In contrast, the other superatomic molecule consisted of two icosahedral Ag12Pd structures with palladium (Pd) as the central atom.      The geometric/electronic structure and stability of these two nanoclusters was then analyzed and compared with [Ag23Pt2(PPh3)10Cl7]0 (1) and [Ag23Pd2(PPh3)10Cl7]0 (2)\u2014two nanoclusters with geometrical similarity to the synthesized nanoclusters, consisting of chlorine (Cl) as the bridging atom.On examining the geometric structures of the four nanoclusters, the researchers observed a twist between the two icosahedral structures containing Br as the bridging ligand. The researchers suggest that this twist stabilizes the nanocluster by shortening the distance between the two icosahedral structures.Additionally, the larger Br atom was found to introduce steric hindrance in the molecule, causing both the PPh3 molecule to be positioned further from the long axis of the metal nanocluster and, a change in the bond length of the Ag-P and Ag-Ag bonds. These findings indicate that although the type of bridging halogen slightly affects the geometric structures of the metal nanoclusters, it does not hinder their formation.\"The type of bridging halogen appears to have little effect on whether superatomic molecules can be formed or not, as long as the bridging halogen is large enough to maintain a moderate distance between the two Ag12M structures,\" explains Prof. Negishi.However, the stability of the nanocluster was largely dependent on the number of bridging halogens attached to it. Like atoms, stable metallic nanoclusters require a filled valence shell. In the case of the prepared nanoclusters\u2014which had a total of 16 valence electrons\u2014the researchers were only able to attach a maximum of five bridging halogens to maintain the metal nanocluster in a stable neutral or cationic state.The presence of Pd and Pt central atoms was found to be due to the formation of metallic nanoclusters. Substituting the central atom of Ag13 with Pt or Pd led to an increase in the average binding energy within the nanoclusters, making it favorable for the formation of superatomic molecules.Overall, the researchers identified three key requirements for the formation and isolation of superatomic molecules consisting of two Ag13\u2212xMx structures connected by vertex sharing. These include the presence of a bridging halogen that can maintain an optimal distance between the two structures, a combination of heteroatoms and bridging halogens that results in 16 valence electrons, and the formation of an icosahedral core that is stronger than Ag13.In the words of Prof. Negishi, \"These findings offer clear design guidelines for the creation of molecular devices with various properties and functions, and can potentially contribute to resolving pressing concerns regarding clean energy and the environment.\" More information:Sayuri Miyajima et al, Key factors for connecting silver-based icosahedral superatoms by vertex sharing, Communications Chemistry (2023).

  "text": "Chemotherapy treatments produce strong side effects. A new agent that accumulates in the tumor tissue and is activated there by ultrasound waves does not have this problem.          Platinum complexes are among the most commonly used drugs against cancer. They are successful, but have severe side effects. An international research team led by Dr. Johannes Karges from the Faculty of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, has developed a complex that accumulates in tumor tissue and is activated there by ultrasound waves.Its cell-damaging effect thus only unfolds where it is actually wanted. \"Where previous studies relied on light activations that can only penetrate a few millimeters deep into the tissue, we have now developed a treatment method with ultrasound activation that penetrates several centimeters deep into the body,\" says Karges.This could make treatment with few side effects possible even for large and deep-seated tumors. The researchers published their results in Angewandte Chemie International Edition.Harmless in healthy tissueThe platinum(II) complexes cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin are among the most commonly used cancer drugs. Their clinical success is offset by severe side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, kidney damage and bone marrow suppression. To overcome these limitations, major research efforts have been invested in the development of so-called platinum(IV) complex prodrugs over the past decades.\"These prodrugs are stable and inactive, so they are completely harmless,\" explains Johannes Karges. \"In healthy tissue, they are supposed to stay that way. In cancer tissue, however, they should be rapidly converted into the therapeutically active platinum(II) complexes.\"Energy is required for the reduction of the metal complex. Previous studies reported activation with ultraviolet, blue or red light. \"The problem is that light can only penetrate less than a centimeter deep into the body and thus does not reach many tumors,\" explains Johannes Karges. To overcome this limitation, his team has for the first time combined platinum(IV) complex prodrugs with sonosensitizers that can be selectively activated with ultrasound irradiation.Nanoparticles accumulate in the tumorTo develop a therapeutically effective complex, the researchers encapsulated the platinum(IV) complex prodrugs and the sonosensitizers together in hemoglobin to form nanoparticles. \"We were able to observe that the nanoparticles selectively accumulated in a mouse intestinal tumor after injection into the bloodstream, thus supporting targeted treatment,\" reports Johannes Karges.\"After irradiation with ultrasound, the platinum(IV) prodrug was activated at the tumor site, triggering the release of cisplatin, which is toxic to cells, and almost completely eradicating the tumor.\"Advantages of ultrasoundThese results could pave the way for the development of novel techniques and agents for the treatment of very large or deep-seated tumors. Ultrasound can penetrate more than an order of magnitude deeper into tissue than near-infrared light. In addition, ultrasound treatments are generally considered to be less invasive and easy to use. Another advantage is that hospitals are usually already equipped with the necessary equipment. \"Our work is still fundamental research,\" Johannes Karges emphasizes.\"Whether and when treatments based on this can be offered in clinical practice is not yet foreseeable.\" More information:Ganghao Liang et al, Reduction of Platinum(IV) Prodrug Hemoglobin Nanoparticles with Deeply\u2010Penetrating Ultrasound Radiation for Tumor\u2010Targeted Therapeutically Enhanced Anticancer Therapy, Angewandte Chemie International Edition (2023).

  "text": "Researchers from Paderborn University, the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRiM),Italy's national metrology institute, the Politecnico di Torino, Italy, and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), National Metrology Institute of Germany, have studied sequential infiltration synthesis in nanostructured polymers.          They hope to improve the possibilities for characterizing material properties at the smallest length scale. Materials with structures in the range of just a few nanometers will be essential, for instance, in future computer chips, energy conversion and energy storage processes, and molecular sieves. The researchers have now published their findings as a cover article in ACS Applied Polymer Materials.At Paderborn, the team led by physicist Prof. J\u00f6rg Lindner works with nanostructured block copolymers, interlinked polymer chains that \"self-organize\" into regular patterns, allowing for a wide range of applications.\"Our ability to control the self-organization of block copolymers has made rapid progress in recent years,\" says Lindner. In order to continue this development, though, nondestructive methods for characterizing material properties must be expanded, as the goal of a larger endeavor involving the co-authors of partner institutions, INRiM, Politecnico di Torino and PTB.Block copolymers allow extremely small structures to be created on semiconductor surfaces, which facilitates future-oriented processes for further miniaturizing next-generation microelectronic components.\"The structure sizes that can be achieved here are limited only by the length of the polymer chains, so they can be even smaller than the structures that are laboriously produced through conventional techniques. The advances in miniaturization also create a need for new measurement methods and size standards so that smaller structures can be analyzed. Block copolymers can help here, too\u2014but only after the chemical differences between the involved polymer types are increased by selectively modifying one of the polymers. Selectively integrating aluminum oxide using sequential infiltration synthesis makes it possible to create nanostructures that can be used to test these new measurement processes,\" explains Lindner.

  "text": "Is it possible to make wearable devices like Spiderman's suit that are thin and soft, yet also feature electrical and optical functionalities? The answer lies in producing novel materials that go far beyond the performance of existing materials and developing technology that enables the precise control of the physical properties of such materials.          Separating transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) into a single layer just like graphene makes it transform into a thin, two-dimensional (2D) film material that exhibits the characteristics of highly performing semiconductors. By stacking two disparate TMD layers, different combinations of TMD types and stacking methods can produce unique properties.For this reason, 2D semiconductors based on heterostructures are attracting attention as an important next-generation material for the electronics industry throughout academia and industries around the world. However, it is still quite challenging to commercialize them due to the difficulty of controlling with precision the physical properties of their quasiparticles.Professor Kyoung-Duck Park, Yeonjeong Koo, and Hyeongwoo Lee from the Department of Physics at POSTECH conducted joint research with the team from ITMO University in Russia led by Professor Vasily Kravtsov to develop a multifunctional tip-enhanced spectroscopy that dynamically controls the quasiparticles of a 2D material in a small space.The team successfully controlled semiconductor particles such as interlayer excitons and interlayer trions that are formed at TMD heterobilayers by using the spectroscopy at about the 20-nm level. The research was recently published in Light: Science & Applications.Like excitons, interlayer excitons of TMD heterobilayers exhibit photoluminescence (PL), which is one of the properties of semiconductor materials. Interlayer excitons, which are electrically neutral quasiparticles, can be used in next-generation semiconductor devices with less heat as they are part light and part matter. They can also be used as a light source for quantum information technologies due to their longer coherence time than those of excitons. Still, there are several hurdles to overcome in their application. They have very low luminous efficiency at room temperature, and it is difficult to modulate their luminous energy.The POSTECH team led by Professor Park, which had proposed technology for controlling excitons in nano-scale spaces in its previous research, successfully developed the multifunctional tip-enhanced spectroscopy that can be adjusted by gigapascal (GPa)-scale pressure and near-field intensity.      The spectroscopy can increase interlayer excitons' luminous efficiency by about 9,000 times and dynamically modulate their luminous energy (the color of the light). In addition, the tip-based hot electron-injection technology enabled the team to achieve the world's first dynamic control of quasiparticle conversion between interlayer excitons and interlayer trions.The most significant advantage of the research breakthrough is that it helps dynamically control the physical properties of the quasiparticles under the condition of room temperature and atmospheric pressure and analyze in real time the optical characteristics of semiconductor particles with the spatial resolution of about 20nm, which is far shorter than the wavelength of light.Yeonjeong Koo, one of the two co-first authors of the research paper, explained, \"The spectroscopy the team developed can be employed in identifying new physical properties of individual semiconductor particles such as interlayer excitons from the TMD heterobilayers. I am very much looking forward to the next physical discoveries.\"The research findings are expected to open up possibilities for various applications of 2D semiconductors based on heterostructures that are being extensively studied as a next-generation material. The fact that basic research in measuring instrument development contributed greatly to the outcome garnered even more attention in the field.The technology is also expected to be used in developing high luminance, ultrathin wearable optoelectronic devices. The achievement is all the more meaningful in the current situation where the U.S., Japan, and China are vying for dominance in the semiconductor equipment market and putting up technology barriers.

  "text": "Metal corrosion seriously affects the service life of marine steel structures. The traditional cathodic protection needs great consumption of energy and metal resources. Therefore, it's imperative to develop green and cost-effective energy sources for corrosion protection.          Recently, a research team led by Prof. Wang Xiutong from the Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IOCAS) focused on triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) as a new energy conversion system, and designed melamine foam (MF) /MXene/Ecoflex@TiO2-TENG (FME@TiO2-TENG) for green electrochemical corrosion protection.The study was published in Nano Energy on March 13.The researchers explored the effects of MXene and TiO2 nanotubes on the charge transfer mechanism of the friction layer. They found that the conductive properties and strong electronegativity of MXene played a positive role in the charge transfer of Ecoflex. At the same time, TiO2 nanotubes could capture the image charge. The combined action of the above two points improved the electrical output performance of TENG, which is conducive to the formation of better cathodic protection effect.In addition, the researchers evaluated FME@TiO2-TENG cathodic protection effect with the help of micro-electrolytic cell system.TENGs technology has the advantages of wide availability of materials, light weight, low cost and high efficiency of low-frequency energy conversion. \"There are abundant mechanical energies available in the marine environment, such as wind energy, wave energy, tidal energy, etc., which provides a convenient energy source for corrosion protection using TENG,\" said Nan Youbo, first author of the study.\"This study demonstrates the potential of TENG as a green energy source for electrochemical cathodic protection, which would provide safety guarantee for the structures and equipment in marine environment,\" said Prof. Wang.

  "text": "Researchers at the University of Bayreuth present novel electrospun nonwovens in Science Advances that exhibit an unusual combination of high electrical conductivity and extremely low thermal conductivity.          The nonwovens represent a breakthrough in materials research: it has been possible to decouple electrical and thermal conductivity based on a simple-to-implement material concept. The nonwovens are made of carbon and silicon-based ceramic via electrospinning process and are attractive for technological applications, for example, in energy technology and electronics. They can be manufactured and processed cost-effectively on an industrial scale.Normally, high electrical conductivity is associated with high thermal conductivity, and low thermal conductivity goes with low electrical conductivity. However, in many high-tech industries, there is growing interest in multifunctional materials that that combine good electric with low thermal transport.Though several strategies have been developed in the materials, like dense inorganic materials, conjugated polymers, and alloys, achieving extremely low thermal conductivity in combination with high electrical conductivity is still a major challenge for flexible, foldable materials.The research team at the University of Bayreuth has discovered an innovative concept to address this challenge: new electrospun nonwovens are made of carbon and silicon based ceramic and consist of fibers with a sea-island type nanostructure and with a diameter between 500 and 600 nanometers.Every fiber contains a matrix of carbon in which nano-sized ceramic phases are homogeneously distributed. The particles form tiny \"islands\" in the \"sea\" of carbon matrix and have opposite, complementary effects. The carbon matrix enables the electron transport in the fibers and thus high electrical conductivity, meanwhile the nano-sized silicon-based ceramic, prevent thermal energy from spreading just as easily.This is because the interface between the nano-sized ceramic and the carbon matrix is very high, while the pores of the nonwoven are very small. As a result, there is a strong scattering of phonons, which is the smallest physical units of vibrations triggered by thermal energy. A continuous directed heat flow does not occur.The unusual combination of high electrical and extremely low thermal conductivity now is highlighted by a comparison with more than 3,900 materials of all types, including ceramics, carbons, natural materials, synthetic polymers, metals, glasses, and various composites. Electron transport and thermal energy insulation were more coupled in the new electrospun composite fiber material than in those other materials.\"Our electrospun nonwovens combine highly attractive multifunctional properties that are usually distributed among different classes of materials: high electrical conductivity, thermal insulation familiar from polymer foams, and non-flammability and heat resistance characteristic of ceramics. The fibers are based on a simple material concept, and they were made from commercial polymers,\" says first author Dr. Xiaojian Liao, a postdoctoral researcher in macromolecular chemistry at the University of Bayreuth.\"We are convinced that our new fibers are suited for several application areas: for example, in the fields of energy management, battery-powered electromobility, smart textiles, or aerospace,\" says Prof. Dr. Seema Agarwal, professor of macromolecular chemistry at the University of Bayreuth and one of the corresponding authors of this new study. The interdisciplinary team at the University of Bayreuth, with expertise in ceramics, polymers, electrospinning, physical chemistry, and electron microscopy, made this work successful.

  "text": "Peanut allergies affect 1 in 50 children, and the most severe cases lead to a potentially deadly immune reaction called anaphylactic shock.          Currently, there is only one approved treatment that reduces the severity of the allergic reaction, and it takes months to kick in. A group of UCLA immunologists is aiming to change that.Taking inspiration from COVID-19 vaccines as well as their own research on the disease, they created a first-of-its-kind nanoparticle\u2014so small it's measured in billionths of a meter\u2014that delivers mRNA to specific cells in the liver. Those cells, in turn, teach the body's natural defenses to tolerate peanut proteins.In testing in mice, the nanoparticle not only reversed peanut allergies, but also prevented them from developing. The study was published in the journal ACS Nano.\"As far as we can find, mRNA has never been used for an allergic disease,\" said Dr. Andr\u00e9 Nel, the paper's co-corresponding author, a UCLA distinguished professor of medicine and director of research at the California NanoSystems Institute at UCLA. \"We've shown that our platform can work to calm peanut allergies, and we believe it may be able to do the same for other allergens, in food and drugs, as well as autoimmune conditions.\"The researchers focused on the liver for two reasons: First, the organ is trained not to respond to every challenge because it is regularly bombarded with foreign substances, including allergens. Second, the organ is home to cells called antigen-presenting cells, which collect foreign proteins and train the immune system to tolerate them rather than attacking when they're detected.The study builds on two previous advances from Nel and his colleagues. In 2021, they found that a nanoparticle delivering a carefully selected protein fragment, called an epitope, to the liver reduced symptoms of dangerous egg allergy in mice. The following year, they identified one epitope that alleviated peanut allergies in mice when delivered to the liver via a nanoparticle. Because these epitopes leave out the part of the peanut or egg protein that triggers allergies, they're expected to be safer as part of a treatment.\"If you're lucky enough to choose the correct epitope, there's an immune mechanism that puts a damper on reactions to all of the other fragments,\" said Nel, who also directs the University of California's Center for Environmental Implications of Nanotechnology, or CEIN. \"That way, you could take care of a whole ensemble of epitopes that play a role in disease.\"      The scientists improved on the design of their previous nanoparticle by adding a sugar molecule on its surface that specifically binds to antigen-presenting cells. Using mRNA was another step forward.In the upgraded nanoparticle, the investigators designed part of the mRNA payload to encode the selected epitope or epitopes\u2014in this case, the peanut protein fragment identified in a previous study\u2014the same way that mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 encode the entire spike protein of the virus. Using mRNA makes it easier to load the nanoparticle and eliminates the complications that come with including more than one epitope, an advantage that may expand the scope of application. For instance, multiple epitopes might be needed to address certain other allergies, or multiple allergies.To evaluate whether their upgraded nanoparticle would prevent peanut allergies, the researchers gave it to six mice in two doses, a week apart. Another group of six mice got a nanoparticle with the same mRNA payload, but with no targeting sugar on its surface; six other mice got the upgraded nanoparticle but with mRNA inside that didn't code for any protein or epitope; and a third group of six got no nanoparticle at all. Starting one week after the second dose, they fed the mice a crude peanut protein extract to sensitize them to the peanut allergens. Another week later, they exposed the mice to peanut protein to trigger anaphylactic shock.Mice that were pretreated with the upgraded nanoparticle showed milder symptoms compared to those who received a nanoparticle with no targeting sugar, while more-serious symptoms appeared in the control group receiving no treatment and the group getting a targeted nanoparticle with noncoding mRNA.The scientists repeated the experiment, changing the order of operations\u2014so that mice were sensitized to peanut protein before receiving the nanoparticle. Again, the upgraded nanoparticle outperformed a similar one that lacked the targeting sugar, and both produced far milder symptoms than the researchers observed in mice given no treatment or a nanoparticle containing noncoding mRNA.In both versions of the experiment, the scientists measured the levels of specific immune cells as well as certain antibodies, enzymes and cytokines, which confirmed that the upgraded nanoparticle had increased the animals' tolerance for peanut protein.Nel estimates that with success in further lab studies, the nanoparticle could be in clinical trials within three years. (His lab will soon begin the regulatory process that's required to test the approach for peanut allergies in clinical trials.) He added that substituting an mRNA payload coding for different epitopes opens up the potential to adapt the nanoparticle for other allergies and autoimmune disorders.The team is exploring whether the nanoparticle could be used to treat type 1 diabetes, a disease in which the immune system attacks cells in the pancreas that enable the body to get energy from food. Important epitopes from the proteins that trigger the immune attack in diabetes have already been identified by other researchers.The study's co-first authors are Xiao Xu, a UCLA postdoctoral scholar, and Dr. Xiang Wang, a UCLA senior researcher.

  "text": "Although the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are safe and effective at preventing severe illness in adults and children, including immunocompromised individuals, researchers have noticed that these shots continue to be the most efficient and effective in younger individuals than in older adults.          Researchers at Drexel University's College of Medicine and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania studied the role of lipid nanoparticles, or LNPs\u2014a vital component of these vaccines that delivers the mRNA cargo to cells, including to cells of the innate immune system (or response cells).According to a recently published article in the journal Communications Biology, these researchers showed that LNPs are able to stimulate innate immune cells from old and young individuals, but more efficiently in younger individuals.The mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines\u2014given the green light from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicine Agency back in 2021\u2014use messenger RNA that instructs cells to make proteins. The mRNA technology behind those vaccines was developed at Penn Medicine.In the case of COVID-19 vaccines, the mRNA instruct the cells to make the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, one component of the virus, to help the immune system recognize it and build up antibodies to fight and neutralize the virus upon subsequent infection.Although seemingly simple, these vaccines rely on a critical packaging made of lipids (fat-like molecules) to protect, and to deliver, the mRNA into cells. The packaging is composed of lipid nanoparticles. These LNPs are usually made of four types of lipids, including a lipid that becomes positively charged under slight acidic conditions to allow the packaging of the negatively charged mRNA during vaccine preparation.Other components of LNPs include cholesterol\u2014the same found in our bodies and in food\u2014and other molecules that help give structure and keep the particles stable. As soon as LNPs enter cells, they release the mRNA.Without LNPs, there would be no mRNA vaccine against COVID-19, or infectious diseases, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and others.In their study, the team of researchers looked at the effect of LNPs using human-derived cell cultures. The researchers separated immune cells, called monocytes, from the blood of 18 healthy adult donors aged between 25 and 75 years.      \"The adjuvanted effect of mRNA-based vaccine is delivered primarily by ionizable lipids in the LNP,\" said senior author Elias El Haddad, Ph.D., a professor in the College of Medicine. \"We found that empty LNPs, those with no mRNA, stimulate dendritic cell maturation\u2014during which cells change from the processing stage to stimulate innate immune system pathways that are less efficient in older adults over 65 years compared to younger adults.\"These new findings confirm previous data from co-corresponding author Mohamad-Gabriel Alameh, Ph.D., a director of the Engineered mRNA and Targeted Nanomedicine Core at Penn Medicine, that ionizable lipids boost vaccine effectiveness. The authors studied the effect of these LNPs on innate immune cells from humans and showed differences between aged and young adults.The researchers say that LNPs are an important factor in mRNA-based vaccines that help in the initiation of vaccine response. A less efficient response to LNPs in older adults could explain reduced vaccine response in these individuals and highlight the need to improve these responses in the aged population.\"Lower or less efficient immune responses to vaccines in older individuals does not have anything to do with the vaccine platform,\" said Alameh. \"It stems from inflammation, metabolic activity and genetics.\"The authors stress that understanding the immune responses to LNPs, and to other adjuvants used in vaccines, in the aged population is critical as it may help offer strategies to improve vaccines in, or even tailor vaccines that are specific for, the aged population.The latest research follows past work by El Haddad and colleagues that focused on developing substances to improve vaccine immune response in elderly adults for another viral infection, HIV. In 2019, El Haddad and colleagues published a study identifying a substance called adenosine deaminase-1, which they have patented, and the role it plays in T cell function among adults with HIV.\"When a pandemic comes you always try to pivot and understand better how to deploy your experience to develop better vaccines for new diseases,\" said El Haddad. \"When we saw that the immune response in older individuals was less efficient than that of younger individuals to the vaccine, that's when we looked at the delivery system\u2014the LNP, which is also the adjuvant part of the vaccine, to understand what effects the LNP's efficiency.\"El Haddad said the next step in the research is to improve the adjuvant effect of the LNP to improve the efficacy of each dose. The team is currently working on multiple strategies including supplementing the LNP with their own adjuvant to see if it is as efficient in older individuals as it is in younger ones.\"The need for better vaccine platforms will likely only grow in the coming years as new infectious diseases emerge along with new opportunities for mRNA vaccines,\" said lead author Jennifer Connors, Ph.D., who participated in the research while completing a doctoral degree in the Drexel College of Medicine and now works in the pharmaceutical industry. \"Decades of research into mRNA vaccines led to the COVID vaccines and decades of research to come will yield incredible vaccine advances to combat disease, including cancer.\" More information:Jennifer Connors et al, Lipid nanoparticles (LNP) induce activation and maturation of antigen presenting cells in young and aged individuals, Communications Biology (2023).

These proteins could help tissues to regenerate, replace misfunctioning proteins, or prompt an immune response, providing a variety of different treatment strategies.          However, a therapeutic is only useful if it can reach its target. The mRNA is typically packaged inside a lipid nanoparticle, which keeps the delicate cargo intact until it reaches its final destination. As the field stands now, mRNA-filled lipid nanoparticles generally reach just a handful of cell types, such as immune cells and cells in the liver or spleen. Designing such lipid nanoparticles that can target hard-to-reach organs, such as the heart or pancreas, could revolutionize treatment options for a wide range of conditions.In response to this need, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University are developing lipid nanoparticles that are designed to carry mRNA specifically to the pancreas. Their study in mice, recently published in Science Advances, could pave the way for novel therapies for intractable pancreatic diseases, such as diabetes and cancer.\"Lipid nanoparticles are essentially tiny spheres of fat, and fats have all kinds of chemical properties that can affect their ability to travel through the body and target specific organs,\" explained Luisa Russell, Ph.D., a program director in the Division of Discovery Science & Technology at the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB). \"By optimizing these fat molecules and investigating alternative drug delivery routes, the study authors were able to design a lipid nanoparticle that can safely deliver mRNA to pancreatic tissue in mice.\"Current mRNA drug delivery routes include intramuscular injection (used in COVID-19 vaccines) and intravenous administration (used in some investigational cancer therapeutics). As a first step towards targeted delivery, the study authors wanted to know if a different administration route might help deliver the mRNA cargo directly to the pancreas. They investigated mRNA delivery via intraperitoneal injection, which involves injecting a drug directly into the fluid that surrounds the organs of the peritoneal cavity (including the kidneys, intestines, and pancreas).      \"While intraperitoneal injection is not commonly used in humans, this type of administration is used clinically for some difficult-to-treat diseases, such as ovarian cancer,\" said senior study author Kathryn Whitehead, Ph.D., a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. \"With very serious pancreatic diseases, the benefits of intraperitoneal injection outweigh the risks.\"The researchers packaged mRNA instructions for firefly luciferase\u2014a bioluminescent protein often used in research\u2014into lipid nanoparticles, and then injected them into mice either intravenously or intraperitoneally. Using the glowing firefly luciferase to see where the mRNA had traveled, they found that intraperitoneal injection resulted in more abundant and more specific delivery to the pancreas compared with intravenous injection.Next, the researchers began to optimize the composition of fat molecules that make up the nanoparticle. Different fats have unique chemical properties\u2014such as size, electrical charge, and hydrophobicity\u2014that can affect what happens to the nanoparticle once it enters the body. One type of fat molecule used is called a \"helper lipid,\" so named because it helps to stabilize the nanoparticle and improves its potency. The researchers wanted to know if changing the charge of the helper lipid might affect the targeting of the nanoparticle and direct it towards the pancreas. After trying a variety of different nanoparticle compositions, the researchers found a combination of lipids that improved pancreatic targeting in mice.\"Within the past couple of years, there's been much more appreciation for how the lipids in nanoparticles can redirect mRNA delivery to different cells and organs,\" said first study author Jilian Melamed, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. \"The precise ways that lipid chemistry affects the potency and specificity of nanoparticles are still being uncovered, and we are still working to understand how individual lipid components influence overall mRNA delivery.\"When the authors investigated where exactly their optimized nanoparticles were going in the pancreas, they were surprised to discover that mRNA was most abundant in pancreatic islet cells, which comprise only 1%\u20132% of total pancreatic tissue. Pancreatic islet cells are responsible for producing hormones that control glucose in the blood (such as insulin). Such specific targeting could have potential downstream clinical applications.\"With further development, our research may lead to the creation of therapies for diabetes or certain types of pancreatic cancer,\" said Whitehead. \"These potential treatments, however, would require more preclinical research before advancing to clinical trials.\" More information:Jilian R.

  "answer_squad": " anisotropic friction",
  "text": "An interdisciplinary research team of the Institutes of Physical Chemistry and Physics of the University of Freiburg and the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics in Frankfurt-am-Main has discovered a new, direction-dependent friction in proteins called anisotropic friction.          \"Until now, nobody had observed that friction in biomolecules was dependent on direction,\" says physicist Dr. Steffen Wolf of the University of Freiburg. The results have been published in Nano Letters.Experiments on model complex of protein-ligandsProteins constitute the microscopic machinery of cells. They perform work during their functional cycles. Accordingly, they follow the laws of thermodynamics, exhibit an energy conversion efficiency, and lose energy during their functional cycle due to dissipation. From a macroscopic perspective, the latter effect corresponds to apparent friction.On the microscopic scale of single proteins, a known source of friction is internal friction of proteins that results from the excitation of protein-internal vibrations. A further source is solvent friction, which arises from the acceleration of surrounding solvent molecules. These sources of friction lead to heating of both protein and solvent. Here, the researchers discovered the novel type of friction by carrying out single molecule experiments and simulations on a model complex of a protein and a ligand.In their single molecule experiments, the team used a new method applying stereographic single molecule force spectroscopy, which is based on atomic force microscopy (AFM). This technique allowed them to study the unbinding of a ligand from a protein bound to a surface not only along a single coordinate, but along all three Cartesian coordinates.During their experiments, Dr. Wanhao Cai, Prof. Dr. Thorsten Hugel and Dr. Bizan N. Balzer of the Institute of Physical Chemistry of the University of Freiburg as well as Dr. Jakob T. Bullerjahn of the Max Planck Institute, made the surprising discovery that friction during ligand unbinding increases with the pulling angle applied.Combining experiment and computer simulationsMiriam J\u00e4ger and Dr. Steffen Wolf of the University of Freiburg's Institute of Physics subsequently recreated the experiment using computer simulations. They used the high performance computing (HPC) resources of the BinAC-HPC-Cluster in T\u00fcbingen. During the simulations they determined that the work of detaching a ligand from its binding site depends on the exact direction of application of the pulling force.By combining results from the experiment and simulations, the researchers recognized that the source of the angle-dependent friction is the undefinable and random orientation of the proteins along their rotational axes bound to the surface in the experiment. The team repeated the single molecule pulling experiments by binding and unbinding a ligand to and from a protein many times in order to achieve statistically significant results.There, the ligand binds to a different protein for each measurement. Consequently, in each measurement, a ligand was pulled at the same angle with respect to the surface, but over different regions of the randomly-oriented protein. This orientation cannot be defined, both in the experimental setup and in the real world, and each measurement cannot be exactly and reversibly repeated. Therefore, each time different amounts of energy were deposited into the biomolecule.The irreversible part of this energy was lost as heat to the system. The corresponding effect is a source of friction, which the researchers call anisotropic friction.      A fundamental type of friction\"We assume that this previously unknown and fundamental type of friction is present in every bioassembly in which randomness in protein orientation appears together with directionality of force application,\" says Dr. Bizan N. Balzer, a biophysicist. He explains that this is the case in biomolecular motors or force-sensitive membrane proteins, as well as for processes such as blood flow, where forces are exerted on randomly oriented proteins.Balzer concludes, \"Anisotropic friction is thus another important piece of the puzzle for understanding friction in both technical applications and in biological complexes in general.\" More information:Wanhao Cai et al, Anisotropic Friction in a Ligand-Protein Complex, Nano Letters (2023).

  "text": "The group led by Professor Naoya Shibata of the University of Tokyo, in collaboration with Sony Group Corporation, succeeded in directly observing a two-dimensional electron gas that accumulated at the semiconductor interface.          GaN-based devices are used as highly efficient light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes (LDs). Because of their high dielectric breakdown strength and saturated electron velocity, these are expected to be used as next-generation high-frequency devices for communication and as power devices for power conversion.In particular, high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) generate a layer of accumulated electrons called a two-dimensional electron gas at the semiconductor interface. Electrons can move at high speeds in this layer, which makes the HEMTs excellent for high-frequency operation.The details of this two-dimensional electron gas are crucial for the performance of semiconductor devices, and they have been estimated via indirect experiments or theoretical calculations. However, direct observation and confirmation of these phenomena are challenging.In this study, the research group combined magnetic-field-free atomic resolution STEM (MARS) with an newly-developed tilt-scan system and ultrahigh-sensitivity, high-speed division-type detector to directly observe the two-dimensional electron gas that accumulated at the gallium nitride/aluminum indium nitride (GaN/AlInN) heterointerface.The group conducted observations using the atomic resolution differential phase contrast (DPC) method, an atomic-level electromagnetic field observation technique developed by Professor Shibata and others. They successfully visualized and quantified the two-dimensional electron gas that accumulated in the several-nanometer-wide area of the semiconductor interface. These advances enabled control of the two-dimensional electron gas and are expected to further improve the performance of transistors.The findings of this study have enabled the development of high-performance high-frequency/power devices that control two-dimensional electron gas, bringing about innovations in interface analysis and control of semiconductor devices. This has also led to groundbreaking measurement technologies that can significantly advance the research and development of cutting-edge materials and devices.The research is published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.

  "text": "Hot bodies emit heat in the form of electromagnetic radiation. Lightbulbs and night vision cameras are examples of technologies based on this physical phenomenon. Our daily experience tells us that heat is always directed from hot bodies to colder ones.          In a new study led by University of New Mexico Physics and Astronomy Professor Alejandro Manjavacas, scientists demonstrate that this does not always occur for rotating nanostructures. This finding could have applications in the generation of thermophotovoltaic energy and the thermal control of electronic devices.The results of this research, titled Control of the Radiative Heat Transfer in a Pair of Rotating Nanostructures, were published in Physical Review Letters.The scientists, who also included Juan R. Deop-Ruano from the Institute of Optics in Madrid, Spain, demonstrated that depending on their rotation frequencies, the radiative heat transfer between two rotating nanostructures can be increased, reduced, or even reversed with respect to the transfer that occurs in the absence of rotation.This allows scientists to have a higher degree of control over the radiative heat transfer by making use of the rotation of the nanostructures.\"The main finding is that we have shown that rotation can modify the radiative heat transfer between two nanostructures,\" Manjavacas said. \"In absence of rotation, such radiative heat transfer is solely determined by the temperatures of the nanostructures. However, as we show in our work when they rotate, this transfer can be enhanced, suppressed, or even reversed.\"Radiative heat transfer between material structures originates from the thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. When the distance between the structures is much smaller than the wavelength of the thermal radiation, the radiative heat transfer can greatly surpass the predictions of Planck's Law due to the contribution of the near-field components of the electromagnetic field. If the dimensions of the structures also fall within that range, the strong responses produced by their electromagnetic resonances provide further enhancement of the radiative heat transfer.\"Regarding applications, any fundamental advance on the understanding of radiative heat transfer can help to improve the technologies that are based on it,\" Manjavacas said. \"The main examples are the generation of thermophotovoltaic energy and the thermal management of electronic devices at the nanoscale.Recent advances in electronics have led to transistors used in microchips having already sizes on the nanoscale. A crucial problem of these systems is that it is very hard to cool them. A deep understanding of radiative heat transfer provides new mechanisms to extract this heat, and therefore, to design more efficient cooling technologies.\"Providing new avenues to control radiative heat transfer is crucial to address technological challenges related to heat management and energy production,\" said Manjavacas. \"For instance, the generation of thermophotovoltaic energy is based on the transformation of heat into electromagnetic radiation, which is absorbed by a photovoltaic cell to produce electricity. The control of the radiative heat transfer makes this process more efficient.\"Scientists are looking at several potential continuations of this work including turning heat into motion.\"We are interested in investigating the possibility of turning heat into motion by exploiting Casimir interactions,\" Manjavacas said. \"Another interesting possibility is to analyze the interplay between rotation and magneto-optical responses in the context of radiative heat transfer and Casimir torque.\" More information:Juan R.

  "text": "An international team of researchers, led by Drexel University, has found that a thin coating of MXene\u2014a type of two-dimensional nanomaterial discovered and studied at Drexel for more than a decade\u2014could enhance a material's ability to trap or shed heat. The discovery, which is tied to MXene's ability to regulate the passage of ambient infrared radiation, could lead to advances in thermal clothing, heating elements and new materials for radiative heating and cooling.          The group, including materials science and optoelectronics researchers from Drexel and computational scientists from the University of Pennsylvania, recently laid out its discovery on the radiative heating and cooling capabilities associated with MXene in a paper entitled \"Versatility of infrared properties of MXene\" in Materials Today.\"This research reveals yet another facet of MXene materials' versatility,\" said Yury Gogotsi, Ph.D., Distinguished University and Bach chair professor in Drexel's College of Engineering, who was a leader of the research.\"MXene coatings possessing exceptional abilities to contain or emit infrared radiation, while remaining extremely thin\u2014200-300 times thinner than a human hair\u2014lightweight and flexible, could find applications in both localized thermal management and large-scale radiative heating and cooling systems. There are significant advantages with passive infrared heating and cooling than traditional active ones, that require electrical power to function.\"MXenes are a family of two-dimensional nanomaterials originally discovered by Drexel researchers in 2011, that\u2014because of their composition and two-dimensional structure\u2014have progressively proven to be exceptional at conducting electricity, storing electrical energy, filtering chemical compounds and blocking electromagnetic radiation, among other capabilities. Over the years, materials scientists have produced and extensively investigated MXenes with various chemical compositions, resulting in the discovery of numerous applications.In their recent paper, the team measured the ability of 10 different MXene compositions to help or hinder the passage of infrared radiation\u2014a measure called \"emissivity\"\u2014which correlates with their ability to passively capture or dissipate ambient heat.      \"We knew from previous research that MXenes are more than capable of reflecting or absorbing radio waves and microwave radiation, so looking at their interaction with infrared radiation, which has a much shorter wavelength, was the next step,\" said Danzhen Zhang, a co-doctoral researcher in Gogotsi's lab and co- author of the paper.\"The advantage of being able to control the passage of infrared radiation is that we can use this type of radiation for passive heating\u2014if we can contain it\u2014or passive cooling\u2014if we can dissipate it. The MXenes we tested showed that they can do both, depending on their elemental composition and the number of atomic layers.\"In comparison to the passive cooling materials available in the market today, which allow the thermal infrared radiation from the body\u2014body heat\u2014to escape through its lightweight and porous textile composition, MXene-coated textiles can do even better, according to Tetiana Hryhorchuk, a doctoral researcher in Gogotsi's lab, and co-author of the research, because these coated textiles have the additional ability to reflect external infrared radiation, to avoid heating from sunlight, while also allowing the infrared radiation, emitted from the body, to pass.The researchers found that niobium carbide MXenes could effectively dissipate heat while titanium carbide exhibited exceptional heat shielding, with its temperature rising only to 43 degrees Celsius after being heated for five minutes on a 110-degree hotplate.\"High emissivity like in niobium carbide is also possible in dielectric materials,\" Gogotsi said. \"However, MXenes combine this ability with electrical conductivity, which means these MXenes can also be used as active electrical heating elements with the supply of external power.\"A coating of titanium carbide MXene was found to strengthen materials against infrared radiation penetration and emission. In testing, the MXene-coated materials, even with a thin coating, performed better at shielding infrared radiation than polished metals, which are currently the best performing commercial materials. This means that MXenes could be integrated into lightweight clothing that keep the wearer warm in extreme environments.To test it, the team dyed a cotton t-shirt with a titanium carbide MXene solution and used an infrared thermal camera to monitor the temperature of a person wearing it. The results showed that the MXene-coated shirt kept its wearer about 10-15 degrees Celsius cooler\u2014about room temperature\u2014than a person wearing a normal tee shirt.These results suggest that MXene-coated garments are effective at maintaining body temperature, while also offering the advantage of being applied via a comparatively eaiser dip-coating process than most thermal clothing requires.\"Commercial thermal clothes use very thin polymer fibers with low thermal conductivity\u2014fleece, for example,\" said Lingyi Bi, a doctoral researcher in Gogotsi's lab, with expertise in textiles. \"They keep us warm by minimizing heat transfer through the fabric, to do this effectively they must be very thick. But MXene primarily keeps us warm by preventing the escape of the body heat as infrared radiation. Therefore, a MXene coating thinner than silk could provide effective warming. This is the same principle that is used in Mylar thermal blankets that runners get after a cold-weather race.\"Gogotsi suggests that the IR-blocking capability could also be used to camouflage people and equipment from thermal detection devices, or to covertly transmit information via radiofrequency identification codes visible only to infrared readers.The team plans to continue studying the mechanisms underlying MXene's IR block and emitting behavior, as well as testing MXenes with different chemical compositions to optimize their potential as radiative heating and cooling materials.

  "text": "Engineers at MIT and the University of Massachusetts Medical School have designed a new type of nanoparticle that can be administered to the lungs, where it can deliver messenger RNA encoding useful proteins.          With further development, these particles could offer an inhalable treatment for cystic fibrosis and other diseases of the lung, the researchers say.\"This is the first demonstration of highly efficient delivery of RNA to the lungs in mice. We are hopeful that it can be used to treat or repair a range of genetic diseases, including cystic fibrosis,\" says Daniel Anderson, a professor in MIT's Department of Chemical Engineering and a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES).In a study of mice, Anderson and his colleagues used the particles to deliver mRNA encoding the machinery needed for CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. That could open the door to designing therapeutic nanoparticles that can snip out and replace disease-causing genes.The senior authors of the study, which appears today in Nature Biotechnology, are Anderson; Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT; and Wen Xue, an associate professor at the UMass Medical School RNA Therapeutics Institute. Bowen Li, a former MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor at the University of Toronto; Rajith Singh Manan, an MIT postdoc; and Shun-Qing Liang, a postdoc at UMass Medical School, are paper's lead authors.Targeting the lungsMessenger RNA holds great potential as a therapeutic for treating a variety of diseases caused by faulty genes. One obstacle to its deployment thus far has been difficulty in delivering it to the right part of the body, without off-target effects. Injected nanoparticles often accumulate in the liver, so several clinical trials evaluating potential mRNA treatments for diseases of the liver are now underway. RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, which are injected directly into muscle tissue, have also proven effective. In many of those cases, mRNA is encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle\u2014a fatty sphere that protects mRNA from being broken down prematurely and helps it enter target cells.Several years ago, Anderson's lab set out to design particles that would be better able to transfect the epithelial cells that make up most of the lining of the lungs. In 2019, his lab created nanoparticles that could deliver mRNA encoding a bioluminescent protein to lung cells. Those particles were made from polymers instead of lipids, which made them easier to aerosolize for inhalation into the lungs. However, more work is needed on those particles to increase their potency and maximize their usefulness.In their new study, the researchers set out to develop lipid nanoparticles that could target the lungs. The particles are made up of molecules that contain two parts: a positively charged headgroup and a long lipid tail. The positive charge of the headgroup helps the particles to interact with negatively charged mRNA, and it also help mRNA to escape from the cellular structures that engulf the particles once they enter cells.The lipid tail structure, meanwhile, helps the particles to pass through the cell membrane. The researchers came up with 10 different chemical structures for the lipid tails, along with 72 different headgroups. By screening different combinations of these structures in mice, the researchers were able to identify those that were most likely to reach the lungs.      Efficient deliveryIn further tests in mice, the researchers showed that they could use the particles to deliver mRNA encoding CRISPR/Cas9 components designed to cut out a stop signal that was genetically encoded into the animals' lung cells. When that stop signal is removed, a gene for a fluorescent protein turns on. Measuring this fluorescent signal allows the researchers to determine what percentage of the cells successfully expressed the mRNA.After one dose of mRNA, about 40 percent of lung epithelial cells were transfected, the researchers found. Two doses brought the level to more than 50 percent, and three doses up to 60 percent. The most important targets for treating lung disease are two types of epithelial cells called club cells and ciliated cells, and each of these was transfected at about 15 percent.\"This means that the cells we were able to edit are really the cells of interest for lung disease,\" Li says. \"This lipid can enable us to deliver mRNA to the lung much more efficiently than any other delivery system that has been reported so far.\"The new particles also break down quickly, allowing them to be cleared from the lung within a few days and reducing the risk of inflammation. The particles could also be delivered multiple times to the same patient if repeat doses are needed. This gives them an advantage over another approach to delivering mRNA, which uses a modified version of harmless adenoviruses. Those viruses are very effective at delivering RNA but can't be given repeatedly because they induce an immune response in the host.To deliver the particles in this study, the researchers used a method called intratracheal instillation, which is often used as a way to model delivery of medication to the lungs. They are now working on making their nanoparticles more stable, so they could be aerosolized and inhaled using a nebulizer.The researchers also plan to test the particles to deliver mRNA that could correct the genetic mutation found in the gene that causes cystic fibrosis, in a mouse model of the disease. They also hope to develop treatments for other lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, as well as mRNA vaccines that could be delivered directly to the lungs.

In the stunning new videos, particles rain down, tumble along stairsteps and slide around before finally snapping into place to form a crystal's signature stacked layers.          Led by Northwestern University and the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, the research team says these new insights could be used to design new materials, including thin films for electronic applications.The research will be published on March 30 in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.Described by the researchers as an \"experimental tour de force,\" the study used a newly optimized form of liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to gain unprecedented insights into the self-assembly process. Before this work, researchers have used microscopy to watch micron-sized colloids\u2014which are 10 to 100 times larger than nanoparticles\u2014self-assemble into crystals. They also have used X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy to visualize single layers of atoms in a crystalline lattice. But they were unable to watch atoms individually move into place.\"We know that atoms use a similar scheme to assemble into crystals, but we have never seen the actual growth process,\" said Northwestern's Erik Luijten, who led the theoretical and computational work to explain the observations. \"Now we see it coming together right in front of our eyes. By viewing nanoparticles, we are watching particles that are larger than atoms, but smaller than colloids. So, we have completed the whole spectrum of length scales. We are filling in the missing length.\"Liquid-phase TEM video of layer-by-layer growth of a crystal with smooth surface from gold concave nanocubes.

These nanoparticles wiggle in solution and grow into crystals of various morphologies like polyhedral or wedding cake.\"Luijten is a professor of materials science and engineering at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering, where he also is an associate dean. Chen is an associate professor of materials science and engineering at Illinois.      Most people are familiar with crystals in the forms of salt, sugar, snowflakes and sparkling gems, such as diamonds. Although crystallization is a ubiquitous phenomenon, exactly how crystals form has remained a mystery. The building blocks\u2014atoms, molecules or ions\u2014that compose crystalline materials are highly ordered, forming lattices of equally spaced building blocks. These lattices then stack on top of each other to form a three-dimensional solid material.\"The stacking of atoms into regular arrangements is the reason that crystals have smooth, flat faces,\" Luijten said. \"That's why they break along straight edges.\"Up until now, researchers have studied crystallization by examining much larger particles called colloids. But watching colloids self-arrange into crystals did not give insights into how atoms behave. Whereas crystals have flat, uniform surfaces, crystalline structures made from micron-sized colloids tend to adopt non-uniform, rough surfaces.\"Colloids are so much larger than atoms that it is doubtful they follow the same steps when crystallizing,\" Luijten said. \"So, they do not teach us what atoms do. The analogy of colloids to atoms doesn't really hold.\"Animation illustrating in-plane and out-of-plane growth modes for crystals of gold concave nanocubes inside a liquid-phase transmission electron microscope (TEM) chamber. Credit: Erik Luijten and Qian ChenTo glean deeper insights into the crystallization process, Luijten, Chen and their teams turned to nanoparticles. Recent advances to improve liquid-phase TEM have made it possible to view nanoparticles in real time as they form solid materials. Chen's team spent years optimizing the process to ensure the electron beam could view the particles without damaging them. In the new study, the researchers used differently shaped nanoparticles\u2014cubes, spheres and indented cubes\u2014to explore how shape affects behavior.The researchers first visualized crystal formation with advanced computer simulations, which were performed by Northwestern graduate students Ziwei Wang and Garrett Watson as well as postdoctoral fellow Tine Curk. Then they performed experiments with liquid-phase TEM to watch the nanoparticles self-assemble in real time. In the experiments, the researchers noticed the particles collided into each other, sticking together to form layers. Then, to form the layer-by-layer crystalline structure, the particles first formed a horizontal layer and then stacked vertically. Sometimes, after sticking to each other, the particles briefly detached to fall onto a layer below.\"They run along and then hesitate at the edge before falling,\" Luijten said. \"It's like a diver hesitating at the edge of a diving board. I can't believe we can actually see this. We have never seen the actual growth process before\u2014only the result.\"Luijten said this information will help engineers design new materials. The insight specifically could help with the design of thin-film materials, which are often used to build flexible electronics, light-emitting diodes, transistors and solar cells.\"Knowing how particles come together will enable us to control the shape of a surface,\" Luijten said. \"Do you want a flat or rough surface? Changing particle shape or how fast the particles fall can affect the surface.\" More information:Erik Luijten, Unravelling crystal growth of nanoparticles, Nature Nanotechnology (2023).

  "text": "Researchers have developed a new way to study the intricate dynamics within living cells by using optically trapped nanodiamond particles as intracellular sensors. Using custom built optical tweezers, the research team trapped the particles within the cell at low power while the cell was alive. The work represents an important advancement in quantum sensing, which takes advantage of quantum mechanics to analyze changes at the atomic level.          The researchers used optical tweezers to trap nanodiamond particles inside single leukemia cells and then demonstrated how the particles can be used to measure magnetic noise within the cell. Fatemeh Kalantarifard from Technical University of Denmark will detail the work at Optica's Biophotonics Congress being held in Vancouver, British Columbia and online April 23\u201327, 2023. Kalantarifard's presentation is scheduled for Monday, April 24.Optically trapped nanodiamondsFluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) have raised interest as promising emitters and sensors for various applications. One of the most remarkable properties of FNDs is detection of physical parameters, including temperature and magnetic field, by quantum sensing. Diamond quantum sensing is based on a paramagnetic defect in diamond, the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center, which allows reading out temperature and magnetic field dependent electron spin at the nanoscale.Recently, researchers have used fluorescent nanodiamonds containing NV centers as intracellular sensors. In the work presented at the conference, researchers combined trapping of FNDs with spin-based photoluminescence measurement techniques common in diamond-based sensing in a single cell. FNDs were first endocytosed by cells from a human leukemia cell line, and they were then trapped by a near IR laser (1064 nm wavelength) at low power while the cell remained alive.Nanoscale sensingOnce the nanodiamonds were in place within the cells and/or on the cell surface, the researchers conducted T1 relaxometry measurements to test their sensing capabilities. This method involves switching on and off a Green (532 nm wavelength) laser pulse that polarizes the electron spins of the NV centers and then lets them revert to equilibrium. Since the polarized configuration exhibits stronger fluorescence than the equilibrium state, researchers determine the spin relaxation rate by optically monitoring the intensity level of fluorescence.Because the magnetic noise in the surrounding environment affects the spin relaxation rate, comparing spin relaxation rates between nanodiamonds positioned in different places allows researchers to map the magnetic noise within the cell. The demonstration shows that optically trapped fluorescent nanodiamonds could represent a precise and flexible method to analyze properties such as magnetic field and temperature within living cells.\"The combination of optical trapping of diamond nanoparticles and nanodiamond-based quantum sensing can provide a powerful tool for studying cell mechanical properties. Optical trapping can help hold the nanodiamond-based sensors with high precision, allowing for more accurate measurements at the nanoscale level. In particular, T1 relaxometry measurements of optically trapped nanodiamonds can be used for free radical detection in cells.\"Free radicals are highly reactive molecules that can cause damage to cells and tissues. They are produced naturally in the body because of metabolism and can also be generated by exposure to environmental factors such as radiation or toxins,\" said Kalantarifard.\"The use of optically trapped nanodiamonds for free radical detection offers several advantages, including high sensitivity, non-invasiveness, and the ability to monitor real-time changes in T1 relaxation time. This technique can be used to study the effects of oxidative stress on cells and may have potential applications in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.\" Provided byOpticaCitation:Researchers use tiny diamonds to create intracellular sensors (2023, March 30)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-03-tiny-diamonds-intracellular-sensors.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Membrane separation technology has become one of the most effective methods for water treatment, owing to its advantages of high separation efficiency, convenient operation and low-energy consumption. The membranes prepared from graphene oxide (GO) have received extensive attention for their high water permeability which is attributable to rapid water transport in the atomically smooth sp2 regions (non-oxidized regions) of their membrane channels.          Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) membranes are theoretically more conducive to the rapid transport of water molecules in their channels compared with graphene oxide (GO) membranes, as they have fewer oxygen-containing functional groups and more non-oxidized regions.However, experimental results from literature indicated that the RGO membranes generally show very low water permeabilities, even lower than 1.0 L/(m2\u00b7h\u00b7bar). The reduction process of GO to RGO can decrease the number of oxygen functional groups on RGO nanosheets, thus, RGO membranes exhibit weaker hydrophilicity and narrower interlayer spacing.Despite rapid transport of water molecules in the non-oxidized regions of RGO membrane channels, their weakly hydrophilic and narrow membrane channels could hamper the entry of water molecules into the channels, resulting in lower water permeability. In addition, the reduction of oxygen functional groups on the RGO membrane surface would weaken the electrostatic interactions between the membrane and charged species, which could lower the rejection rates for these charged species.In order to solve the problem that the weak hydrophilicity of RGO membrane inhibits the water entry channel and leads to low water permeability, Prof. Xie Quan from Dalian University of Technology and his team members have constructed electroconductive MXene-intercalated RGO (RGO-MXene) membranes with wettability-regulated channels by intercalating MXene into RGO membranes.This study entitled \"Electroconductive RGO-MXene membranes with wettability regulated channels: improved water permeability and electro-enhanced rejection performance\" is published online in Frontiers of Environmental Science & Engineering.The research team found the RGO-MXene composite membrane exhibits high pure water permeance of 62.1 L/(m2\u00b7h\u00b7bar), approximately 16.8 times that of the RGO membrane (3.7 L/(m2\u00b7h\u00b7bar)). Wettability test results and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the improved water permeance results from the enhanced wettability of RGO-MXene membrane and increased rate of water molecules entering the RGO-MXene channels.Benefiting from good conductivity, the RGO-MXene membrane with electro-assistance exhibits significantly increased rejection rates for negatively charged dyes (from 56.0% at 0 V to 91.4% at 2.0 V for Orange G) without decreasing the permeate flux, which could be attributed to enhanced electrostatic repulsion under electro-assistance.In this work, electroconductive RGO-MXene membranes are prepared by intercalating MXene into RGO membranes. The wettability of the membrane is regulated by tuning the mass percentage of MXene in the composite membrane. Wettability characteristics and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that membrane wettability and the rate of water molecules entering the membrane channels are important factors for improving water flux.In addition, the RGO-MXene membrane exhibits improved rejection rates for charged dyes under electro-assistance. This work is expected to provide a new perspective for future research on the construction of novel membrane channel structures with high water transport and molecule rejection.

  "text": "Like electronics or photonics, magnonics is an engineering subfield that aims to advance information technologies when it comes to speed, device architecture, and energy consumption. A magnon corresponds to the specific amount of energy required to change the magnetization of a material via a collective excitation called a spin wave.          Because they interact with magnetic fields, magnons can be used to encode and transport data without electron flows, which involve energy loss through heating (known as Joule heating) of the conductor used. As Dirk Grundler, head of the Lab of Nanoscale Magnetic Materials and Magnonics (LMGN) in the School of Engineering explains, energy losses are an increasingly serious barrier to electronics as data speeds and storage demands soar.\"With the advent of AI, the use of computing technology has increased so much that energy consumption threatens its development,\" Grundler says. \"A major issue is traditional computing architecture, which separates processors and memory. The signal conversions involved in moving data between different components slow down computation and waste energy.\"This inefficiency, known as the memory wall or Von Neumann bottleneck, has had researchers searching for new computing architectures that can better support the demands of big data. And now, Grundler believes his lab might have stumbled on such a \"holy grail\".While doing other experiments on a commercial wafer of the ferrimagnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet (YIG) with nanomagnetic strips on its surface, LMGN Ph.D. student Korbinian Baumgaertl was inspired to develop precisely engineered YIG-nanomagnet devices. With the Center of MicroNanoTechnology's support, Baumgaertl was able to excite spin waves in the YIG at specific gigahertz frequencies using radiofrequency signals, and\u2014crucially\u2014to reverse the magnetization of the surface nanomagnets.\"The two possible orientations of these nanomagnets represent magnetic states 0 and 1, which allows digital information to be encoded and stored,\" Grundler explains.Credit: Ecole Polytechnique Federale de LausanneA route to in-memory computationThe scientists made their discovery using a conventional vector network analyzer, which sent a spin wave through the YIG-nanomagnet device. Nanomagnet reversal happened only when the spin wave hit a certain amplitude, and could then be used to write and read data.\"We can now show that the same waves we use for data processing can be used to switch the magnetic nanostructures so that we also have nonvolatile magnetic storage within the very same system,\" Grundler explains, adding that \"nonvolatile\" refers to the stable storage of data over long time periods without additional energy consumption.It's this ability to process and store data in the same place that gives the technique its potential to change the current computing architecture paradigm by putting an end to the energy-inefficient separation of processors and memory storage, and achieving what is known as in-memory computation.      Optimization on the horizonBaumgaertl and Grundler have published the groundbreaking results in the journal Nature Communications, and the LMGN team is already working on optimizing their approach.\"Now that we have shown that spin waves write data by switching the nanomagnets from states 0 to 1, we need to work on a process to switch them back again\u2014this is known as toggle switching,\" Grundler says.He also notes that theoretically, the magnonics approach could process data in the terahertz range of the electromagnetic spectrum (for comparison, current computers function in the slower gigahertz range). However, they still need to demonstrate this experimentally.\"The promise of this technology for more sustainable computing is huge. With this publication, we are hoping to reinforce interest in wave-based computation, and attract more young researchers to the growing field of magnonics.\" More information:Korbinian Baumgaertl et al, Reversal of nanomagnets by propagating magnons in ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet enabling nonvolatile magnon memory, Nature Communications (2023).

  "text": "Cambridge researchers have discovered a new topological phase in a two-dimensional system, which could be used as a new platform for exploring topological physics in nanoscale devices.          Two-dimensional materials such as graphene have served as a playground for the experimental discovery and theoretical understanding of a wide range of phenomena in physics and materials science. Beyond graphene, there are a large number 2D materials, all with different physical properties. This is promising for potential applications in nanotechnology, where a wide range of functionality can be achieved in devices by using different 2D materials or stacking combinations of different layers.It was recently discovered that in materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which are less symmetric than graphene, ferroelectricity occurs when one layer slides over the other and breaks a symmetry. Ferroelectricity is the switching of a material's electric dipole moment with an electric field, which is a useful property for information processing and memory storage.When 2D materials are twisted with respect to one another, they form a beautiful interference pattern known as a moir\u00e9 superlattice, which can radically change the physical properties. When hBN and similar materials are twisted the different stacking regions become polarized, leading to a regular network of polar domains, which have also been shown to lead to ferroelectricity.In this new study reported in Nature Communications, researchers from Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory and the University of Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, have discovered that there is more to these polar domains that everyone is studying: they are inherently topological and form objects known as merons and antimerons.\"The polarization in twisted systems points in the out-of-plane direction, that is to say perpendicular to the layers,\" said first author Dr. Daniel Bennett, who started this project at the Cavendish Laboratory and is now based at Harvard University, U.S..\"What we found is that the symmetry breaking caused by sliding or twisting also results in an in-plane polarization which is similar in strength to the out-of-plane polarization. The in-plane polarization forms a beautiful vector field, and its shape is determined entirely by the symmetry of the layers.\"The discovery of the in-plane polarization shows that the electrical properties of 2D twisted systems are much more complex than previously thought. More importantly, combining both the in-plane and out-of-plane parts of the polarization, the team realized that the polarization in these twisted bilayers is topologically non-trivial.\"In each domain, the polarization field winds around by half a revolution, forming a topological object known as a meron (half a skyrmion),\" said Dr. Robert-Jan Slager, whose group at the Cavendish Laboratory was involved in the study. \"Throughout the twisted layer, a robust network of merons and antimerons forms.\"\"In physics, most things can be understood in terms of energy,\" said Bennett. \"Nature is lazy and likes to do things in the most efficient way possible, doing so by minimizing the energy of a system.\"The phase that a material will adopt is typically the one that has the lowest energy. However topological phases and topological properties are not determined by energetics, but by the various symmetries of a system. The physical properties of a system, such as its electric or magnetic fields, can form complex structures which wind or tie themselves in knots because they are forced to by symmetry.\"The energetic cost of untying these knots is very high, so these structures end up being quite robust,\" said Slager. \"Being able to create, destroy and control these topological objects is very appealing, for example in the field of topological quantum computing.\"In order to do this, the researchers' future goals are to develop a better understanding of topological polarization, as well as develop a proof of concept for a device in which the polar merons/antimerons they discovered can be controlled, or lead to exciting new physical phenomena.

In recent years, wearable energy storage devices have become indispensable in our lives due to their vast application foreground. Flexibility and safety are two important points of flexible battery to focus on.\"A battery is like a hamburger. Cathode and anode are like the two slices of bread, and the electrolyte is the filling,\" said Mao Yunjie, first author of the study, \"our solution is to prepare a low-cost flexible substrate CF by carbonizing melamine foam and fabricate flexible cathode (VS2@CF) and anode (Zn@CF).\"They used a self-healing gel (PVA/Zn (CF3SO3)2) as the electrolyte and obtained a quasi-solid zinc-ion battery with good flexibility and self-healing properties.The secret of their success is the novel aqueous Zn-storage flexible cathode material VS2@CF, prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method. The cathode features rich active sites, good hydrophilicity, high electronic/ionic conductivity, large surface area and flexible architecture.The VS2@CF cathode provides exceptional rate capability and ultra-long life cycle. Impressively, the flexible quasi-solid-state zinc-ion batteries using the VS2@CF cathode, Zn@CF anode and PVA/Zn (CF3SO3)2 self-healing gels can still be charged and discharged normally under different bending angles and have good self-healing properties.The CF provided a low-cost flexible electrode substrate for flexible energy storage devices, and the PVA/Zn (CF3SO3)2 self-healing gels provided a new idea for the design of wearable electronic devices, according to the researchers.

  "text": "Tiny, disc-shaped pieces of membrane called nanodiscs offer exciting possibilities for nanomedicine. Although they have previously been mostly made of synthetic lipids and proteins, a research team has now introduced nanodiscs based on the cell membranes of human red blood cells. As reported in the journal Angewandte Chemie International Edition, they are able to neutralize dangerous bacterial toxins.          Nanodiscs are disc-shaped lipid bilayers with diameters mostly under 20 nm. They are surrounded and stabilized by scaffolds made of proteins, peptides, or synthetic polymers. Because of their disc shape, they are significantly less likely than their spherical counterparts to be \"swallowed\" and destroyed by immune cells. They are thus attractive for applications like targeted drug transport. Their small size and disc shape allows nanodiscs to effectively enter lymph nodes, making them potentially useful as nanovaccines.Previous nanodiscs have primarily been based on synthetic lipid bilayers whose lipid compositions must be carefully\u2014and laboriously\u2014optimized for specific applications. In addition, synthetic lipids can trigger undesirable immune reactions. A team led by Liangfang Zhang at the University of California, San Diego (La Jolla, U.S.) are using natural cell membranes as starting materials for nanodiscs. Natural membranes contain native lipids and proteins whose biological functions are maintained in the nanodiscs, which could be therapeutically useful. The team demonstrated their concept with membranes from red blood cells.Red blood cells were made to burst, and their membranes were separated out and mixed with a copolymer of styrene and maleic acid. This resulted in the formation of nanodiscs (NDs) consisting of the natural membrane lipids and proteins from the red blood cells (RBCs) and stabilized by the copolymer. Called RBC-NDs, these tiny structures can be stored for long periods and are both biocompatible and non-toxic.Interestingly, these RBC-NDs are capable of effectively neutralizing certain bacterial toxins, as demonstrated in tests with \u03b1-toxin from a strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. S. aureus is found almost everywhere and is usually harmless. However, in immunocompromised patients, open wounds, or after operations, for example, it can spread and cause life-threatening lung infections, toxic shock, and sepsis. Strains that are resistant to antibiotics are particularly dangerous. The primary toxin from these bacteria, \u03b1-toxin, destroys blood cells (hemolysis). In vitro, RBC-NDs can bind \u03b1-toxin and neutralize its hemolysis and cytotoxicity. In vivo, injection of RBC-NDs significantly improved the chances of survival in mice that had been given \u03b1-toxin or a complex mixture of the various proteins excreted by S. aureus.The design strategy used for the RBC-NDs could also be extended to other types of membranes for a wide range of applications.

  "text": "Normally, we have to make a choice in physics: Either we deal with big things\u2014such as a metal plate and its material properties, or with tiny things\u2014such as individual atoms. But there is also a world in between: The world of small but not yet tiny things, in which both effects of the macroscopic world and effects of the microscopic world play a role.          The experiments conducted at TU Wien are located in this complicated in-between world: Extremely small pieces of gold, consisting of a few thousand atoms and with a diameter in the order of ten nanometers, are bombarded with highly charged ions. This makes it possible to change the shape and size of these gold pieces in a targeted manner. The results show: What happens in the process cannot simply be pictured like the impact of a golf ball in a sand bunker\u2014the interaction of ion and gold piece is much more subtle.Energy transferred by ion bombardment\"We work with multiply-ionized xenon atoms. Up to 40 electrons are removed from these atoms, so they are highly electrically charged,\" says Prof. Richard Wilhelm from the Institute of Applied Physics at TU Wien. These highly charged ions then hit small gold islands placed on an insulating substrate\u2014and then different things can happen: The gold islands may become flatter, they can melt, they can even evaporate.\"Depending on how highly our ions are electrically charged, we can trigger different effects,\" says Gabriel Szabo, first author of the current study, who is currently working on his dissertation in Richard Wilhelm's team.The highly charged ions hit the tiny gold nuggets at elevated speed\u2014at around 500 kilometers per second. Nevertheless, it is remarkably not the force of the impact that changes the gold islands. The process is completely different from the impact of a golf ball in a pile of sand, or the accidental impact of a tennis ball in a nicely decorated birthday cake.\"If you shoot uncharged xenon atoms at the gold islands with the same kinetic energy, the gold islands remain practically unchanged,\" says Gabriel Szabo. \"So the decisive factor is not the kinetic energy, but the electrical charge of the ions. This charge also carries energy, and it is deposited exactly at the point of impact.\"Changes in the electronic structureAs soon as the extremely strongly positively charged ions hit the nano gold piece, they snatch electrons away from the gold. In a large piece of gold, this would have no significant effect: Gold is an excellent conductor, the electrons can move freely, and more electrons would be supplied from other areas of the gold nugget.      But the nano-gold structures are so small that they can no longer be regarded as an inexhaustible reservoir of electrons. It is precisely here that one enters the intermediate world between macroscopic metal and tiny atomic clusters and their nanoscale properties.\"The charge energy of the impacting ion is transferred to the gold, thus the electronic structure of the entire nano-gold object is thrown completely out of balance, the atoms start to move and the crystal structure of the gold is destroyed,\" explains Richard Wilhelm. \"Depending on how much energy you deposit, it may even happen that the entire nano-gold piece melts or is vaporized.\"The effects of the ion bombardment can then be studied in an atomic force microscope: Depending on the charge of the ions, the height of the gold pieces is reduced to a lesser or greater extent, Gabriel Szabo reports: \"Just as our models had also predicted, we can control the impact of the ions on the gold\u2014and not by the speed we give our projectiles, but rather by their charge.\"Improved control and deeper understanding of such processes is important for making a wide variety of nanostructures. \"It's a technique that allows you to selectively edit the geometry of particularly small structures. That's just as interesting for the creation of microelectronic components as it is for so-called quantum dots\u2014tiny structures that allow very specific tailor-made electronic or optical effects due to their quantum physical properties,\" says Richard Wilhelm.And it is another insight into the world of small but not yet tiny things\u2014into the multifaceted intermediate world between quantum physics and solid-state physics, which can only be understood by keeping quantum and many-particle phenomena in mind at the same time.The study is published in the journal Small.

  "text": "Researchers from Xi'an Jiaotong University revealed the atomic flow behavior of nano-joints in AgNWs Interconnect Network. In order to further improve the joint quality, the thermal welding process and atomic evolution behavior of Ag nanowires were studied through a combination of in situ experimental and molecular dynamics simulations.          The team systematically analyze the atomic flow behavior during the formation of different types of Ag nanowire joints. The influence of processing time, temperature, and stress distribution due to spatial arrangement on nanojoints was systematically explored. What's more, the failure mechanisms and their atomic interface behavior of the nanojoints were also investigated. These results may advance the industrial application of Ag nanowire interconnection networks in flexible electronics and transparent conductive films.As the size of nano-joints shifts to the nanoscale, their thermal sensitivity increases significantly and the study of the temperature dependence of joints and thermal defect damage mechanisms during their welding process becomes increasingly important. For Ag nanowires, there is a more pronounced capillary phenomenon in the nano-gaps during welding and their weld morphology is subject to local stress in addition to temperature.For thermally induced welding methods, the final quality of the joint is sensitive to the initial spacing and alignment direction between the nanowires. Three types of nano-joints can be obtained during the welding process: head-to-head, head-to-side (T-shaped) and side-to-side (X-shaped) joints. For the first two joint forms, the weld morphology is mainly influenced by the horizontal pitch in addition to temperature. For X-shaped nano-joints, in addition to temperature, the joint shape is greatly influenced by local stresses due to the spatial structure of the top and bottom.One of the lead researchers, Professor Jianlei Cui, commented, \"The characteristics of the joint in the interconnected network of AgNWs are not only influenced by the temperature, but also by the local stress and its interaction with the substrate, at the same time capillary interactions show a non-negligible influence in interfacial flow at the nanoscale. Furthermore, within the right temperature range, the atomic flow of the joint becomes more and more adequate with increasing treatment time and the quality of the joint becomes better and better.\"The in-situ heating system of the electron microscope allows us to directly observe and analyze the evolution of the atomic morphological features during the welding of Ag nanowires. The author Xiaoying Ren explained, \"In our work, we directly observed the excitation and resorption of a large number of Ag nanoparticles on the surface of AgNWs during thermal excitation, and the mechanism of nanoparticle formation may be due to capillary-induced surface diffusion and permeation.\"      The excitation and reabsorption of these nanoparticles is accompanied by a gradual filling of the nanogaps with Ag atoms, forming fully welded nano-joints with increasing time.To further investigate the effect of local stress on X-shaped nano-junctions, the authors found that AgNWs generate certain stress concentrations in the parts with curvature, and these parts usually show local damage or fracture under thermal excitation in the following process.During the formation of an X-joint, the upper nanowires will flow violently under the influence of local stress and temperature, and their atoms will flow along the surface of the lower nanowires, eventually forming an encapsulated nano-joint, which leads to the formation of a large number of defects on both sides of the upper nanowire joint, and these X-shaped nano-junctions are the first to fracture on both sides of the upper nanowires during the later thermal excitation process.In order to further analyze the evolution of the atomic behavior of Ag nanowires under thermal excitation and the mechanism of thermal damage, the author Chenchen Huang said that \"We have systematically analyzed the Rayleigh destabilization of Ag nanowires under thermal excitation using molecular dynamics simulations, and the results show that Ag nanowires form equally spaced nanoparticles due to Rayleigh destabilization at high temperatures.\"Professor Xuesong Mei said, \"How to effectively improve the welding quality of AgNWs joints and ensure the application stability of the joints has always been the focus of research. With the further integration and miniaturization of devices, the thermal sensitivity and thermal damage mechanisms of nano-joints in the application process will also attract more and more attention in the future.\"The study is published in the International Journal of Extreme Manufacturing.

A study published this month in Advanced Materials shows that materials as small as 1.2 nanometers across could function in solar cells, which harvest energy from the sun. The inorganic halide materials are templated within carbon nanotubes, tiny tubules formed from carbon atoms.The discovery of such small nanowires could potentially lead to new properties and applications of this type of sustainable energy.Researchers from the University of Warwick, Oxford Materials and SuperSTEM, a U.K. national center for electron microscopy, revealed the absolute minimum limit at which halide perovskite-like structures can be produced as free-standing materials inside carbon nanotube. Halide perovskites have similar structures to calcium titanate and are commonly used in solar panels and light emitting diodes (LEDs).Dr. Jeremy Sloan, from Warwick's Department of Physics said, \"In contrast to large 'bulk' halide perovskites, we show that much smaller 'picoscale' halide perovskite structures just a single unit cell or even just one quarter of a unit cell in cross section can be encapsulated in carbon nanotubes ranging between 1.2\u20131.6nm in diameter.\"Our study shows remarkably similar results to a publication in Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS) by researchers at the University of Berkeley, further highlighting the potential applications of these tiny materials in solar cells.\"The wider implications of these studies will help to extend the remarkable optoelectronic characteristics of halide perovskites to sub-nanometer, or even picoscale dimensions.\" More information:Reza J.

  "answer_squad": " moir\u00e9 effects",
  "text": "Novel, ultrathin nanomaterials exhibit remarkable properties. If you stack individual atomically thin layers of crystals in a vertical assembly, for example, fascinating physical effects can occur. For instance, bilayers of the wonder material graphene twisted by the magic angle of 1.1 degrees may exhibit superconductivity. And researchers are also focusing their attention on bilayer semiconducting heterostructures made of so-called transition metal dichalcogenides, which are held together weakly by van der Waals forces.          The research group led by Alexander H\u00f6gele investigates such novel heterostructures, which do not occur in nature. \"The combination of materials, the number of layers, and their relative orientation give rise to a wide variety of novel phenomena,\" says the LMU physicist.\"In the lab, we can tailor physical phenomena for various applications in electronics, photonics, or quantum technology with properties that are unknown in naturally occurring crystals.\" Experimentally observed phenomena are not always easy to interpret, however, as a new paper published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology demonstrates.H\u00f6gele's team investigated a heterobilayer system held together by van der Waals forces and fabricated from semiconductor monolayers of molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) and tungsten diselenide (WSe2). Depending on the orientation of the individual layers, moir\u00e9 effects can emerge.These effects, which we are familiar with from everyday life, also arise in the nano-world when two different atomic lattices are stacked upon each other, or two identical lattices are twisted with respect to each other. The difference in the nano case is that it is not an optical effect. In the quantum mechanical world of atomically thin crystal heterostructures, moir\u00e9 interference dramatically affects the properties of the composite system, also impacting electrons and strongly bound electron-hole pairs, or excitons, explains H\u00f6gele.\"Our work shows that the na\u00efve notion of a perfect moir\u00e9 pattern in heterobilayer MoSe2-WSe2 does not necessarily hold true, particularly for small angles of rotation. Therefore, the interpretation of the phenomenology observed to date will have to be partially revised,\" says H\u00f6gele. Instead of periodic moir\u00e9 patterns, there are laterally extended areas that are free from moir\u00e9 interferences.Moreover, there are zones with interesting quantum mechanical effects such as one-dimensional quantum wires or quasi zero-dimensional quantum dots that are potentially viable for applications in quantum communication based on spatially localized excitons with single-photon emission characteristics. In the latter case, ideal moir\u00e9 patterns presumably transform into periodic patterns with triangular or hexagonal tiling.The reason seems to lie in an elastic deformation of the lattice structure that depends on the orientation of the layers. The atoms are displaced out of their equilibrium positions, which comes at the expense of increased strain in individual layers but promotes better adhesion among the layers.The result is an energy landscape in the heterobilayer system that can be engineered and potentially exploited by means of rational design. \"We also observe collective phenomena in synthetic crystals, where periodic moir\u00e9 patterns have a dramatic effect on the motion of electrons as well as their mutual interactions,\" says H\u00f6gele.Of decisive importance is the understanding of excitons\u2014electron-hole pairs\u2014that are characteristic for the distinct types of atomic registries in bilayer crystal heterostructures and which could potentially be utilized in future opto-electronic applications. These excitons are generated in semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides by means of light absorption, and convert back into light again.\"Excitons thus act as mediators of light-matter interaction in semiconductor crystals,\" says H\u00f6gele. As the current paper shows, different types of excitons arise depending on the actual structure of the heterobilayer systems in parallel or antiparallel alignment. \"We want to learn how to manufacture van der Waals heterostructures with customized properties in a deterministic approach to control the rich emergent phenomenology of correlated effects such as magnetism or superconductivity.\" More information:Shen Zhao et al, Excitons in mesoscopically reconstructed moir\u00e9 heterostructures, Nature Nanotechnology (2023).

  "answer_squad": " Surface-enhanced Raman scattering",
  "text": "Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (or spectroscopy), known as SERS, is an advanced analysis method that extends the range of Raman applications to trace analysis, such as part-per-million-level detection of a pollutant in water or different liquids. SERS has a high potential to be used in the fields of biochemistry, forensics, food safety, threat detection and medical diagnostics.          But before the method can be applied at industrial and clinical levels, there is still a need for inexpensive and reliable SERS substrates that will allow reproducible spectral signals. Material Scientists from Kiel University carried the SERS approach to an advanced level by developing a new substrate with plasmonic and photocatalytic nanostructures. It increases the sensitivity, spatial and temporal resolution and leads to 50 times more powerful analyses than classical SERS.Researchers designed this new substrate to be reusable, which significantly reduces the cost. Their results have been published in the journal Small.The substrate plays a crucial roleRaman spectroscopy\u2014named after physicist and Nobel Prize winner Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman\u2014is a method of determining the chemical composition of materials. Therefore it can also detect harmful substances. For this purpose, a material sample is irradiated with a laser. Based on the reflected Raman signal, conclusions can be drawn about the properties of the material.\"The substrate plays the most critical role in the performance of this analytic technique, because of interactions with the laser light influence the Raman signal,\" explains Josiah Ngenev Shondo. As a doctoral researcher at the Chair for Multicomponent Materials, he works to improve the detection and photocatalytic clean-up of pollutants in water.By combining materials with different properties, the researchers have now succeeded in producing a novel substrate for SERS analysis that enhanced the Raman signal by a factor of 50 in comparison to classical SERS.\"That's more than has ever been reported before for this method,\" says Professor Oral Cenk Aktas. That enormously increases the sensitivity, spatial, and temporal resolution in analysis of materials at trace amounts. As a result, even very small amounts of material can now be analyzed in a short time. Before and after the material analysis the researchers irradiate the substrate with UV light for activation and clean-up, respectively.\"This way the analyte is decomposed and the substrate, which is quite costly, can be re-used several times now. We showed that our substrate can be reused at least twenty times without any loss of its Raman activity,\" Aktas continues.      Substrate carries SERS approach to an advanced levelThe researchers created the novel surface with a composition of nanocolumnar structures, a nanocrack network, nanoscale mixed oxide phases, and nanometallic structures (\"4N-in-1\"). This surface enhances the Raman signal and provides a high detection sensitivity. Recently PIERS (Photo Induced Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy), a new extension of SERS method, has been proposed.With their novel PIERS substrate \"4N-in-1\" the research team combines plasmonic and photocatalysis concepts to achieve high resolution and signal enhancement in SERS analysis. \"Our substrate brings various superior properties together on the same substrate. In addition to the plasmonic nanostructures, it is composed of extremely active titanium dioxide layer,\" says Dr. Salih Veziroglu.Further plans: Spin-off and combination with AI methods\"This substrate is the result of many years of long-standing experience and various expertise in our Chair. Now we want to transfer our findings from fundamental research into an application,\" says Professor Franz Faupel, head of the Chair. Their substrate can easily be combined with any type of Raman spectroscopy, and this may trigger various new applications.To bring their advanced method of Raman spectroscopy to the market, they are looking for other research groups and companies in laboratory and analytical technology. They also plan to combine their method with artificial intelligence (AI) to create a comprehensive data basis for materials analysis. This could enable faster and more precise detection of individual molecules.One idea for a concrete application was already investigated by Shondo in his doctoral thesis, which is about to be completed. In 2018, the materials scientist came to Kiel University with a scholarship from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) intent to do something about the environmental pollution in his home country of Nigeria. The extraction of the country's large oil deposits contaminates soils, rivers and even drinking water.With the new substrate Shondo and his colleagues have developed, he sees potential for using it with portable Raman spectroscopy equipment in Nigeria: \"Since even small amounts of oil can be detected and even removed, this method could be used at an early stage and prevent worse environmental damage.\" More information:Josiah Shondo et al, Nanoscale Synergetic Effects on Ag\u2013TiO2 Hybrid Substrate for Photoinduced Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (PIERS) with Ultra\u2010Sensitivity and Reusability, Small (2022).

  "text": "Infection and immunity status of the population are considered key parameters for handling pandemics. For this purpose, detecting antigens and antibodies is of great importance. The devices currently used for this purpose\u2014what are known as point-of-care (POC) devices\u2014are one option for rapid screening.          Their sensitivity, however, needs further improvement. Scientists at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) have been successful in such improvement by developing a nanobiosensor based on gold nanowires. Originally only intended for the detection of COVID-19-associated antigens and antibodies, the biosensor is also transferable to other biomarkers.It is by now known from numerous studies that for detecting SARS-CoV-2, what are referred to as POC lateral flow tests (LFT) are a good and precise alternative to the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, commonly known as PCR tests. The numerous advantages of LFT over PCR testing include rapid detection, on-site testing, low cost, and operation without laboratory equipment.The greatest shortcoming of POC biosensors, however, is that their sensitivity is dependent on viral load. At a high viral load, sensitivity is one hundred percent, whereas at a low viral load, sensitivity may fall below ten percent. This can lead to false negative test results. The HZDR researchers' aim was to develop sensor systems that can also be used for detecting low virus loads while providing quick and accurate results.To do so, Dr. Larysa Baraban and her team at the HZDR-Institute of Radiopharmaceutical Cancer Research utilized nano wires made of gold, which can be employed to detect various biomolecules such as enzymes, proteins and antibodies.This approach was combined with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, a technique that provides information on various processes at the electrode-electrolyte interface, including charge transfer, diffusion transport and formation of an electrical double layer, as well as on the properties of the measurement system. This includes solution resistance and roughness or porosity of the electrode surface.\"In our work, we have developed a nanoscopic biosensor chip consisting of six pairs of interlocking gold nanowire devices for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antigens and antibodies,\" says Baraban of the project.\"This makes it possible to detect both COVID-19-associated antigens and corresponding antibodies that appear during and after infection with the virus. We assume that the method is also transferable to other biomarkers and pathogens. The functional layer targeting the biomolecule must be modified accordingly for this purpose.\"Considerations and discussions are currently underway with the industry on how the sensor can be manufactured in large quantities at low cost.The research is published in the journal ACS Sensors.

  "answer_squad": " proteins",
  "text": "In a study recently published in the journal ACS Nano, researchers from Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan, collaborating with University of Washington, Seattle, U.S., used frequency modulated atomic force microscopy to reveal the molecular architecture of a genetically designed peptide and its self-organization that forms single-molecule thick crystals on atomically flat graphite surfaces, offering a potential platform for hybrid technologies such as bioelectronics, biosensors and protein arrays.          Just like a protein, a peptide also has a chain of natural amino acids, but it is much shorter, say 10-30 units, compared to those in proteins, which could be hundreds and thousands of units long. Along with DNA (genetic code), polysaccharides (sugars) and lipids (fats), proteins are the fourth major building blocks that make life viable. Proteins collect ions and transport them, carry out enzymatic functions, and constitute the major structures of the cells.Proteins, therefore, are the key building blocks of organisms carrying out life's functions making it dynamic. For decades, scientists have been trying to understand how the sequence of amino acids in proteins are correlated to their molecular architecture so that one can predict their specific functions. The understanding of the protein's shape and function is crucial to discover the origin of diseases and designing of vaccines and drugs.Proteins can also be useful for technological applications such as in tissue engineering and designing biosensors for diagnostics. So far, however, predicting protein's structure has been elusive, even by using the recently developed computational models such as Alpha-Fold, based on Google's deep learning algorithms. Using proteins, therefore, has still not been practical because of their enormous size and unpredictable functions.Peptides, on the other hand, are smaller versions of proteins with similar roles, and therefore are more practical as their roles also rely on the amino acid sequences that lead to their folding patterns. Because of their smaller sizes and disordered molecular structures, for years, peptides have been considered to be not so useful because of having unpredictable functions.The \"floppy\" structures of peptides, however, could be turned into an advantage if these small biomolecules could be engineered using an interdisciplinary approach, combining biology, engineering and predictive modeling. This is exactly what a team of scientists, led by Ayhan Yurtsever, Linhao Sun, Kaito Hirata, and Takeshi Fukuma at Kanazawa University and their colleagues, Mehmet Sarikaya, a materials scientist, and his team, at the University of Washington, have accomplished.      Combining the Seattle-Team's expertise in genetic engineering in designing peptides that have exclusive affinity to technological solids and Kanazawa-Team's expertise in molecular imaging under biologically benign conditions, the scientists have demonstrated self-organization of the peptides on a solid surface and visualized them at unprecedented molecular resolution, the knowledge is essential in designing hybrid biomolecular nanodevices for use in biology and technology alike.The scientists accomplished this feat by combining their expertise in their respective fields. The peptides used were selected by an ingenious approach, called directed evolution, normally used for selecting cancer drugs for a specific tumor by molecular biologists. In this case, the molecule used, called graphite binding peptide, was genetically selected using graphite as the substrate, by a materials scientist.Armed with the expertise gained in examining molecular architectures in aqueous solutions, the Kanazawa team demonstrated the way the peptide self-organizes on atomically flat graphite surface is in patterns, predicted by computational modeling of the peptides.Knowing that the way the proteins carry out their function is through molecular recognition of their biological substrates (for example, DNA, proteins, enzymes, other biomolecules, or diseased cells), the scientists realized that the peptides predictably self-organize on graphite, a synthetic substrate, because of the same molecular recognition principle as in biology.The origin of molecular recognition and its control via designing a new amino acid sequence is the holy grail in biology as, if the process can be controlled, then many kinds of drugs and vaccines can be designed based on the target (diseased) molecule or the substrate. Here, the target is a technological material, graphite, or it can also be graphene, its single atomic layer version, a highly significant technological material of the last two decades.In this work, the Kanazawa-Seattle collaborative teams have discovered that the graphite binding peptide not only recognizes graphite atomic lattice but also forms its own molecular crystal thereby establishing a coherent, continuous, soft interface between the peptide and the solid.\"The capability of seamlessly bridging biology with functional solids at the molecular level is the critical first step towards creating biology-inspired technologies and is likely to lend itself in the design of biosensors, bioelectronics, and peptide-based biomolecular arrays, and even logic devices, all hybrid technologies of the future,\" the scientists say.The teams are currently busy in expanding their discovery in addressing further questions, such as the effects of mutations, structured water around peptides, on other solid substrates, and physical experiments across the peptide-graphite interfaces towards establishing the firm scientific foundations for the development of the next generation biology-inspired technologies.

  "text": "Researchers at Tel Aviv University have developed a hybrid micro-robot, the size of a single biological cell (about 10 microns across), that can be controlled and navigated using two different mechanisms\u2014electric and magnetic. The micro-robot is able to navigate between different cells in a biological sample, distinguish between different types of cells, identify whether they are healthy or dying, and then transport the desired cell for further study, such as genetic analysis.          The micro-robot can also transfect a drug and/or gene into the captured targeted single cell. According to the researchers, the development may help promote research in the important field of single-cell analysis, as well as find use in medical diagnosis, drug transport and screening, surgery, and environmental protection.The innovative technology was developed by Prof. Gilad Yossifon from the School of Mechanical Engineering and Department of Biomedical Engineering at Tel Aviv University and his team: Post-doctoral researcher Dr. Yue Wu and student Sivan Yakov, in collaboration with Dr. Afu Fu, Post-doctoral researcher, from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology. The research was published in the journal Advanced Science.Prof. Gilad Yossifon explains that micro-robots (sometimes called micro-motors or active particles) are tiny synthetic particles the size of a biological cell, which can move from place to place and perform various actions (for example: collection of synthetic or biological cargo) autonomously or through external control by an operator.According to Prof. Yossifon, \"Developing the micro-robot's ability to move autonomously was inspired by biological micro-swimmers, such as bacteria and sperm cells. This is an innovative area of research that is developing rapidly, with a wide variety of uses in fields such as medicine and the environment, as well as a research tool.\"As a demonstration of the capabilities of the micro-robot the researchers used it to capture single blood and cancer cells and a single bacterium, and showed that it is able to distinguish between cells with different levels of viability, such as a healthy cell, a cell damaged by a drug, or a cell that is dying or dying in a natural \"suicide\" process (such a distinction may be significant, for example, when developing anti-cancer drugs).      After identifying the desired cell, the micro-robot captured it and moved the cell to where it could be further analyzed. Another important innovation is the ability of the micro-robot to identify target cells that are not labeled\u2014the micro-robot identifies the type of cell and its condition (such as degree of health) using a built-in sensing mechanism based on the cell's unique electrical properties.Prof. Yossifon states, \"Our new development significantly advances the technology in two main aspects: hybrid propulsion and navigation by two different mechanisms\u2014electric and magnetic. In addition, the micro-robot has an improved ability to identify and capture a single cell, without the need for tagging, for local testing or retrieval and transport to an external instrument. This research was carried out on biological samples in the laboratory for in-vitro assays, but the intention is to develop in the future micro-robots that will also work inside the body\u2014for example, as effective drug carriers that can be precisely guided to the target.\"The researchers explain that the hybrid propulsion mechanism of the micro-robot is of particular importance in physiological environments, such as found in liquid biopsies. \"The micro-robots that have operated until now based on an electrical guiding mechanism were not effective in certain environments characterized by relatively high electrical conductivity, such as a physiological environment, where the electric drive is less effective. This is where the complementary magnetic mechanism come into play, which is very effective regardless of the electrical conductivity of the environment.\"Prof. Yossifon concludes, \"In our research, we developed an innovative micro-robot with important capabilities that significantly contribute to the field: hybrid propulsion and navigation through a combination of electric and magnetic fields, as well as the ability to identify, capture, and transport a single cell from place to place in a physiological environment. These capabilities are relevant for a wide variety of applications as well as for research.\"Among other things, the technology will support the following areas: medical diagnosis at the single cell level, introducing drugs or genes into cells, genetic editing, carrying drugs to their destination inside the body, cleaning the environment from polluting particles, drug development, and creating a 'laboratory on a particle'\u2014a microscopic laboratory designed to carry out diagnostics in places accessible only to micro-particles.\" More information:Yue Wu et al, A Magnetically and Electrically Powered Hybrid Micromotor in Conductive Solutions: Synergistic Propulsion Effects and Label\u2010Free Cargo Transport and Sensing (Adv.

  "text": "World-first 'phase change inks' that could transform how we heat and cool buildings, homes and cars\u2014to achieve sophisticated 'passive climate' control\u2014have been developed, with enormous potential to help reduce energy use and global greenhouse gas emissions.          New research published in The Royal Society of Chemistry's Journal of Materials Chemistry A led by Dr. Mohammad Taha, documents proof-of-concept 'phase change inks' that use nanotechnology to control temperature in everyday environments. They achieve this by adjusting the amount of radiation that can pass through them, based on the surrounding environment.Dr. Taha said these inks could be used to develop coatings to achieve passive heating and cooling, reducing our need to rely on energy creation to regulate temperatures.\"Humans use a lot of energy to create and maintain comfortable environments\u2014heating and cooling our buildings, homes, cars and even our bodies,\" Dr. Taha said.\"We can no longer only focus on energy generation from renewable resources to reduce our environmental impact. We also need to consider reducing our energy consumption as part of our proposed energy solutions, as the impacts of climate change become a reality.\"By engineering our inks to respond to their surroundings, we not only reduce the energy expenditure, but we also remove the need for auxiliary control systems to control temperatures, which is an additional energy waste.\"Passive climate control would enable comfortable living conditions without expending energy unnecessarily. For example, to provide comfortable heating in winter, the inks applied on a building fa\u00e7ade could automatically transform to allow greater sun radiation to pass through during the day, and greater insulation to keep warmth in at night. In summer, they could transform to form a barrier to block heat radiation from the sun and the surrounding environment.The versatile 'phase change inks' are a proof-of-concept that can be laminated, sprayed or added to paints and building materials. They could also be incorporated into clothing, regulating body temperature in extreme environments, or in the creation of large-scale, flexible and wearable electronic devices like bendable circuits, cameras and detectors, and gas and temperature sensors.Dr. Taha said: \"Our research removes the previous restrictions on applying these inks on a large scale cheaply. It means existing structures and building materials can be retrofitted. With manufacturing interest, the inks could reach market in five to 10 years.\"Through collaboration with industry, we can scale up and integrate them into existing and new technologies as part of a holistic approach to tackling the world's climate change energy challenges.\"The potential of this material is huge as it can be used for so many different purposes\u2014like preventing heat build-up in laptop electronics or on car windshields. But the beauty of this material is that we can adjust its heat absorption properties to suit our needs.\"Already, a different type of phase change material is used to manufacture smart glass, but our new material means we can engineer smarter bricks and paint. This new nanotechnology can help retrofit existing buildings to make them more efficient. It's better for the environment and sustainable for the future.\"The breakthrough was achieved by discovering how to modify one of the main components of 'phase change materials'\u2014vanadium oxide (VO2). Phase change materials use triggers, like heat or electricity, to create enough energy for the material to transform itself under stress. However, phase change materials previously needed to be heated to very high temperatures for their 'phase changing' properties to be activated.\"We used our understanding of how these materials are put together to test how we could trigger the insulator to metal (IMT) reaction, where the material basically acts as a switch to block heat beyond a particular temperature\u2014near-room temperature (30-40 C),\" Dr. Taha said.Dr. Taha said the next step will involve taking the research, patented by the University of Melbourne, to production.

  "text": "Does a \"magic bullet\" exist in regenerative medicine? Researchers have long wished to design a cutting-edge gene therapy that regenerates tissues damaged by disease or trauma. That wish may come true now that a research team has developed a polymeric gene delivery therapy that promotes new bone formation after traumatic inflammation.          In a study published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, researchers from Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU) have revealed that a gene delivery therapy can effectively suppress inflammation to enhance tissue healing after tooth extraction.Tooth extraction is a common surgical procedure in dental medicine. When a tooth is removed, sores are formed on the socket, which triggers a physiological healing process involving the reconstruction of damaged soft and hard tissues. One phase of wound healing, known as hemostasis, begins by stopping the bleeding from blood clots, which stimulates an inflammatory phase.This can help prevent further bleeding, but complications can arise if prolonged. After tooth extraction, excessive inflammation can cause residual ridge resorption (reduction of the residual bone in the jaw), which can induce a negative and aggravating impact on dental surgery.Bone remodeling, which occurs throughout life, is mediated by a signaling pathway that involves the protein complex NF-\u03baB (nuclear factor-kappa B). It controls the production of genes that regulates inflammation and bone healing. \"Inhibitors of NF-\u03baB are widely recognized in the treatment of bone resorption; however, the application of an NF-\u03baB decoy oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) is poorly investigated,\" explains lead author Takashi Ono.In this study, tooth extraction was conducted using molar extraction surgery. A gene/drug delivery system was developed utilizing an efficient copolymer vector\u2014a type of poly(Lactic-co-glycolic Acid)\u2014to deliver NF-\u03baB decoy ODNs (double-stranded DNA fragments) to the extraction socket of rats and their therapeutic effects were investigated. It was found that the local administration of NF-\u03baB decoy ODNs using a copolymer vector effectively inhibited bone resorption and promoted bone formation at the extraction socket.Additionally, gene delivery therapy prevented excessive inflammation. \"This is the first in-vivo study revealing the efficacy of NF-\u03baB decoy ODNs administered by a copolymer vector to promote bone healing after tooth extraction,\" says Ono.The findings of this study may lead to innovative gene therapy to prevent residual ridge resorption after surgical tooth extraction.

  "answer_squad": " LION/repRNA",
  "text": "Newly developed mRNA vaccines against Zika virus and HIV-1 produced strong antibody responses that transferred from pregnant rabbits to their offspring, researchers report in the journal Molecular Therapy. As noted by the authors, the results support further development of their vaccine platform, LION/repRNA, for maternal and neonatal settings to protect against mother-to-child transmission of pathogens in animals and humans.          The recent success of mRNA vaccines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is a catalyst for the development of mRNA vaccines targeting other infectious diseases. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized mRNA vaccines for children aged 6 months and older, and preliminary findings in pregnant women have shown no obvious detriment.\"Preventing mother-to-child transmission is a major goal for reducing disease burden in newborns,\" says senior author Amit Khandhar, a material scientist at HDT Bio Corp. \"With mRNA vaccines attracting global attention, there is a need to evaluate their safety and immunogenicity in preclinical models that inform maternal and childhood vaccination.\"Khandhar collaborated with Herman Staats of Duke University School of Medicine and Noah Sather of Seattle Children's Research Institute to evaluate self-amplifying replicon (repRNA) vaccines. The researchers delivered the vaccines with their clinical-stage LION nanoparticle formulation in pregnant rabbits by using Zika virus and HIV-1 as model disease targets. These two pathogens play a major role in causing infections in newborns after mother-to-child transmission.The repRNA vaccines encode viral enzymes that amplify the expression of a gene of interest by 10- to 100-fold over non-replicating mRNA, providing dosing and manufacturing advantages.The proprietary LION delivery technology is a stable oil-in-water nanoparticle emulsion that electrostatically binds and protects nucleic acids, in contrast to lipid nanoparticle formulations, which encapsulate RNA. Because LION is stored independent of repRNA, it has plug-and-play functionality, allowing for rapid evaluation of new repRNA vaccine constructs such as those recently developed to address emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.The results showed that repRNA immunization at a relatively high dose was well tolerated and had no detrimental impact on litter size. The LION/repRNA vaccines also triggered robust antigen-specific antibody responses in adult pregnant rabbits that were likely passively transferred to offspring in utero\"While the strong correlation in both the magnitude and quality of antibody levels between mothers and newborns suggests that the antibodies detected in kits were likely acquired passively from mothers, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the vaccine administered to mothers may itself distribute to kits and actively induce antibody responses,\" Khandhar says.The researchers also found that the timing of maternal vaccination was critical for maximizing antibody transfer, and subsequent vaccination in newborns maintained elevated antibody levels in comparison to no vaccination. In addition to optimized maternal vaccination timing, active immunization in newborns might be required for maintaining overall antibody responses in infants after birth. The authors say more research is needed to determine whether RNA-based maternal vaccines can afford protection against infection by mother-to-child transmission.\"For instance, the immunization intervals we used were not optimized and will likely not translate to humans due to differences in the gestation periods between rabbits and humans,\" Khandhar says. \"Further studies will be needed to test boosting intervals and the durability of antibody responses to maximize passive antibody transfer to newborns. Lastly, additional studies designed to measure safety signals in maternal and neonatal models will be needed before advancing to clinical evaluation.\" More information:Amit P.

  "answer_race": " A new way to study graphene-like materials.",
  "question_squad": " What is the most famous two-dimensional material?",
  "answer_squad": " graphene",
  "text": "Graphene is one of the strongest materials. On top of that, it is exceptionally good at conducting heat and electrical currents, making it one of the most special and versatile materials we know. For all these reasons, the discovery of graphene was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010.          Yet, many properties of the material and its cousins are still poorly understood\u2014for the simple reason that the atoms they are made up of are very difficult to observe. A team of researchers from the University of Amsterdam and New York University have now found a surprising way to solve this issue.Two-dimensional materials, consisting of a hyper-thin single layer of atomic crystal, have attracted a lot of attention recently. This well-deserved attention is mainly due to their unusual properties, very different from their three-dimensional 'bulk' counterparts. Graphene, the most famous representative, and many other two-dimensional materials, are nowadays researched intensely in the laboratory.Perhaps surprisingly, crucial to the special properties of these materials are defects, locations where the crystal structure is not perfect. There, the ordered arrangement of the layer of atoms is disturbed and the coordination of atoms changes locally.Visualizing atomsDespite the fact that defects have been shown to be crucial for a material's properties, and they are almost always either present or added on purpose, not much is known about how they form and how they evolve in time. The reason for this is simple: atoms are just too small and move too fast to directly follow them.In an effort to make the defects in graphene-like materials observable, the team of researchers, from the UvA-Institute of Physics and New York University, found a way to build micrometer-size models of atomic graphene. To achieve this, they used so-called 'patchy particles'. These particles\u2014large enough to be easily visible in a microscope, yet small enough to reproduce many of the properties of actual atoms\u2014interact with the same coordination as atoms in graphene, and form the same structure.The researchers built a model system and used it to obtain insight into defects, their formation and evolution with time. Their results were published in Nature Communications.                Pieces of a graphene lattice made from patchy particles. Because the particles can be followed one-by-one, defects can be studied at the particle scale. Credit: University of Amsterdam             Building grapheneGraphene is made up of carbon atoms that each have three neighbors, arranged in the well-known 'honeycomb' structure. It is this special structure that lends graphene its unique mechanical and electronic properties. To achieve the same structure in their model, the researchers used tiny particles made of polystyrene, decorated with three even tinier patches of a material known as 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl\u2014or TPM for short.The configuration of the TPM patches mimicked the coordination of carbon atoms in the graphene lattice. The researchers then made the patches attractive so that the particles could form bonds with each other, again in analogy with the carbon atoms in graphene.After being left alone for a few hours, when observed under a microscope the 'mock carbon' particles turned out to indeed arrange themselves into a honeycomb lattice. The researchers then looked in more detail at defects in the model graphene lattice. They observed that also in this respect the model worked: it showed characteristic defect motifs that are also known from atomic graphene.Contrary to real graphene, the direct observation and long formation time of the model now allowed the physicists to follow these defects from the very start of their formation, up to the integration into the lattice.Unexpected resultsThe new look at the growth of graphene-like materials immediately led to new knowledge about these two-dimensional structures. Unexpectedly, the researchers found that the most common type of defect already forms in the very initial stages of growth, when the lattice is not yet established. They also observed how the lattice mismatch is then 'repaired' by another defect, leading to a stable defect configuration, which either remains or only very slowly heals further to a more perfect lattice.Thus, the model system not only allows researchers to rebuild the graphene lattice on a larger scale for all sorts of applications, but the direct observations also allow insights into atomic dynamics in this class of materials. As defects are central to the properties of all atomically thin materials, these direct observations in model systems help further engineer the atomic counterparts, for example for applications in ultra-lightweight materials and optical and electronic devices.The findings are published in Nature Communications.

  "text": "Corneal transplants can be the last step to returning clear vision to many patients suffering from eye disease. Each year, approximately 80,000 corneal transplantations take place in the U.S. Worldwide, more than 184,000 corneal transplantation surgeries are performed annually.          However, rejection rates for the corneal grafts can be as high as 10%. This is largely due to poor patient compliance to the medications, which require frequent administrations of topical eyedrops over a long period of time.This becomes especially acute when patients show signs of early rejection of the transplanted corneas. When this occurs, patients need to apply topical eyedrops hourly to rescue the corneal grafts from failure.The tedious process of eyedrop dosing causes a tremendous burden for patients. The resulting noncompliance to medication treatment can lead to even higher graft-rejection rates.Research led by a team at Virginia Commonwealth University may make the corneal grafts more successful by using nanoparticles to encapsulate the medication. The novel approach could significantly improve patient compliance, according to a paper recently published in Science Advances titled \"Six-month effective treatment of corneal graft rejection.\"Each nanoparticle encapsulates a drug called dexamethasone sodium phosphate, one of the most commonly used corticosteroids for various ocular diseases treatment such as ocular inflammation, non-infectious uveitis, macular edema and corneal neovascularization. By using the nanoparticles to control the release of the medicine over time, patients would require only one injection right after the corneal transplantation surgery without the frequent eye drops. Our studies have shown that using this method the medication maintains its efficacy for six months on a corneal graft rejection model.In addition, because the medicine is released slowly and directly where it is most needed, the approach requires much lower doses than current standard eyedrop treatment while providing better efficacy and safety profiles.Qingguo Xu, D.Phil., the principal investigator of this project and an associate professor of pharmaceutics and ophthalmology at VCU School of Pharmacy, collaborated with Justin Hanes, Ph.D., the Lewis J. Ort professor of ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins University.Xu said, \"To improve patient compliance and treatment efficacy, we developed a tiny nanoparticle (around 200 nanometers) that in animal studies enables the release of the drug up to six months after a single subconjunctival injection along the eyeball.\"Tuo Meng, Ph.D., who worked on the project as a doctoral student at VCU and is the first author of this paper, said, \"In our preclinical corneal graft rejection model, the single dosing of the nanoparticle successfully prevented corneal graft rejection for six months.\"More importantly, the nanoparticle approach reversed signs of early rejection and maintained corneal grafts for six months without rejection.

  "answer_squad": " layers",
  "text": "The secret to a perfect croissant is the layers\u2014as many as possible, each one interspersed with butter. Similarly, a new material with promise for new applications is made of many extremely thin layers of metal, between which scientists can slip different ions for various purposes. This makes them potentially very useful for future high-tech electronics or energy storage.          Until recently, these materials\u2014known as MXenes, pronounced \"max-eens\"\u2014were as labor-intensive as good croissants made in a French bakery.But a new breakthrough by scientists with the University of Chicago shows how to make these MXenes far more quickly and easily, with fewer toxic byproducts.Researchers hope the discovery, published March 23 in Science, will spur new innovation and pave the way towards using MXenes in everyday electronics and devices.Atom economyWhen they were discovered in 2011, MXenes made a lot of scientists very excited. Usually, when you shave a metal like gold or titanium to create atomic-thin sheets, it stops behaving like a metal. But unusually strong chemical bonds in MXenes allow them to retain the special abilities of metal, like conducting electricity strongly.They're also easily customizable: \"You can put ions between the layers to use them to store energy, for example,\" said chemistry graduate student Di Wang, co-first author of the paper along with postdoctoral scholar Chenkun Zhou.All of these advantages could make MXenes extremely useful for building new devices\u2014for example, to store electricity or to block electromagnetic wave interference.However, the only way we knew to make MXenes involved several intensive chemical engineering steps, including heating the mixture at 3,000\u00b0F followed by a bath in hydrofluoric acid.\"This is fine if you're making a few grams for experiments in the laboratory, but if you wanted to make large amounts to use in commercial products, it would become a major corrosive waste disposal issue,\" explained Dmitri Talapin, the Ernest DeWitt Burton Distinguished Service Professor of Chemistry at the University of Chicago, joint appointee at Argonne National Laboratory and the corresponding author on the paper.To design a more efficient and less toxic method, the team used the principles of chemistry\u2014in particular \"atom economy,\" which seeks to minimize the number of wasted atoms during a reaction.The UChicago team discovered new chemical reactions that allow scientists to make MXenes from simple and inexpensive precursors, without the use of hydrofluoric acid. It consists of just one step: mixing several chemicals with whichever metal you wish to make layers of, then heating the mixture at 1,700\u00b0F. \"Then you open it up and there they are,\" said Wang.The easier, less toxic method opens up new avenues for scientists to create and explore new varieties of MXenes for different applications\u2014such as different metal alloys or different ion flavorings. The team tested the method with titanium and zirconium metals, but they think the technique can also be used for many other different combinations.\"These new MXenes are also visually beautiful,\" Wang added. \"They stand up like flowers\u2014which may even make them better for reactions, because the edges are exposed and accessible for ions and molecules to move in between the metal layers.\"Graduate student Wooje Cho was also a co-author on the paper. The exploration was made possible by help from UChicago colleagues across departments, including theoretical chemist Suri Vaikuntanathan, X-ray research facility director Alexander Filatov, and electrochemists Chong Liu and Mingzhan Wang of the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering. Electron microscopy was performed by Robert Klie and Francisco Lagunas with the University of Illinois Chicago.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the method that has been developed for exfoliating MoS2 flakes?",
  "answer_squad": " microwave-assisted exfoliation",
  "text": "A team of researchers has developed a new method for exfoliating MoS2 flakes that produces very large and very thin flakes with high yield. The microwave-assisted exfoliation yields 50 times more flakes than those obtained by ultrasonication and gives a material quality comparable to mechanical exfoliation. This fast process requires minimal processing and holds promise to enable new applications in electronic and photonic devices.          MoS2 is a transition metal dichalcogenide, a material interesting in the field of electronics for its wide range of physical properties from semimetallic to semiconductors, superconductors or insulators, depending on its dimensions. The number of stacked layers is crucial in determining these properties. Monolayer MoS2, for instance, exhibits a direct bandgap of 1.90 eV, while bulk 2H-MoS2 presents an indirect bandgap of 1.23 eV. These tailorable properties make them ideal candidates for applications. However, obtaining large area, high-quality MoS2 flakes has proved challenging.Existing liquid-phase exfoliation methods have low yields and often result in broad thickness distributions, making it difficult to obtain monolayer and few-layered 2H-MoS2. In an attempt to improve yields, researchers have explored other techniques, including ball milling, electrochemical exfoliation, and fluid dynamics exfoliation. However, these methods have scalability problems or produce metallic 1T- MoS2, which has different properties and applications.                The lateral dimension of the MoS2 flake (highlighted in 1 and 2) is larger than 5 microns. Credit: ACS Nano             The team, led by Professors V\u00edctor Sebasti\u00e1n and Jes\u00fas Santamar\u00eda from the Institute of Nanoscience and Materials in Zaragoza (INMA, CSIC-UNIZAR), and Professor Emilio M. P\u00e9rez from the Madrid Institute of Advanced Studies in Nanoscience (IMDEA Nanociencia), both in Spain, have tested a novel microwave-assisted method for exfoliating MoS2 flakes. They found that the method produced well-exfoliated material with lateral sizes comparable to those obtained by mechanical exfoliation. The yield of the process is roughly 50 times greater than ultrasonication exfoliation methods. It yields a material quality comparable to mechanical exfoliation, whose flakes are similar to those obtained by this method but with an incomparably higher yield (mechanical exfoliation is actually carried out flake by flake). The process is fast, taking only a few minutes, and requires minimal processing.This method takes the best of both worlds (mechanical and liquid phase exfoliation), improving the results of each case in terms of thickness, lateral size, yield, and processing time. The researchers' method represents a significant advance in the field of MoS2 exfoliation, offering a high-yield, fast, and microwave-assisted process that produces well-exfoliated, few-layered MoS2 flakes. The method has the potential to enable new applications of MoS2 in electronic and photonic devices. It has been applied to MoS2, but it could be used to exfoliate any material with high microwave absorption capabilities, being a versatile approach in the area of emerging 2-dimensional (2D) materials. The researchers plan to investigate the method further, exploring its scalability and potential applications in more detail.      Professors Sebasti\u00e1n and P\u00e9rez say that the most exciting thing about your results is \"...the lateral size of the flakes. 2D materials have to be very thin, of course, and that is the whole point of exfoliation methods, but it is often overlooked that for most applications, you want them to be large in lateral size, too. But obtaining flakes which are large and thin at the same time, as well as with high yield, is not easy, as all exfoliation methods come down to adding some form of energy to the bulk material, to overcome the van der Waals interactions between layers. And it is difficult to prevent that same energy causing lateral damage at the same time. Our method manages to use microwaves to evaporate solvent molecules between layers, creating a high pressure between them very quickly, so that they can be separated, but are not damaged.\"Asked about the potential real-life applications of the method, the researchers respond, \"2D materials in general, and transition-metal dichalcogenides in particular, are promising for a lot of technologies (sensors, electronics, etc.) but obviously it all starts with making these materials with good quality, ideally in large quantities, and cheaply. This is where our work can contribute. It is not a step towards a new specific technology, but rather a tool to help all of the hope deposited on 2D materials become a reality.\"The study is published in the journal ACS Nano.

  "text": "A research team led by Professor Kelvin Yeung Wai-kwok from the Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, School of Clinical Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong (HKUMed) has invented a non-invasive and non-antibiotics technology to effectively reduce methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection in bony tissue.          The novel antibacterial nano-sheets can release a substantial amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) subject to ultrasound stimulation. With the engulfment of neutrophil membrane (NM), the nano-sheets are able to actively capture the MRSA bacteria deeply seated in bony tissue and effectively eliminate 99.72% \u00b1 0.03%. The research has been published in Advanced Materials.Bone infection (osteomyelitis) is an infection in bone or bone marrow caused by bacteria, fungi, or other microorganisms. The common causative pathogenic organism is MRSA. Severe infections can put patients at the risk of amputation, or even induce life-threatening sepsis. In clinical practice, the treatment of bone tissue infection typically involves antibiotics and surgical debridement to remove the infected bone or tissue.However, excessive use of antibiotics not only compromises the host's innate immune function, but may also inevitably induce the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. Recently, phototherapy (including photodynamic and photothermal therapy) has been applied as an antibiotic-free strategy to tackle bacterial infections. However, conventional phototherapy is unable to address deep tissue infection in bones due to its limited penetration power.The researchers therefore pursued an alternative antibiotic-free strategy harnessing the penetration power of ultrasound in human tissues.The HKUMed research team invented a new two-dimensional (2D) sonosensitizer, Ti3C2-SD(Ti3+) nano-sheets. A conventional sonosensitizer arranged in zero-dimension yields limited efficiency in ROS generation.The innovative 2D sonosensitizer, containing an abundance of planar catalytic sites, can effectively generate a substantial amount of ROS when it is triggered by an ultrasound signal. After being covered with a neutrophil membrane (NM), the NM-Ti3C2-SD(Ti3+) nano-sheets (NM-nano-sheets) can actively track down the MRSA bacteria in bony tissue subject to ultrasound stimulation.In an animal model, the novel nano-sheets have eliminated the MRSA bacteria in bone in more than 99.72% of cases, whereas the antibiotics therapy (Vanco) is ineffective. Furthermore, the NM-nano-sheets can also alleviate tissue inflammation and assist bone repair once bony tissue infection has been controlled. In addition, the NM-coated nano-sheets do not present any acute bio-safety issues.Professor Kelvin Yeung Wai-kwok remarked, \"Our design has achieved a qualitative leap in which the ROS catalytic site in sonosensitizer has transformed from zero-dimensional to two-dimensional. This invention can remarkably increase the production of bactericide (ROS). We may also consider applying this invention to the post-operation bacterial infection commonly seen in bone cancer patients or the patients with cystitis and peritonitis in the future.\" More information:Congyang Mao et al, Realizing Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Bactericidal Capability through the Phonon\u2013Electron Coupling Effect Using Two\u2010Dimensional Catalytic Planar Defects, Advanced Materials (2022).

  "text": "Researchers at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, have developed a new method that can easily purify contaminated water using a cellulose-based material. This discovery could have implications for countries with poor water treatment technologies and combat the widespread problem of toxic dye discharge from the textile industry.          Clean water is a prerequisite for our health and living environment, but far from a given for everyone. According to the World Health Organization, WHO, there are currently over two billion people living with limited or no access to clean water.This global challenge is at the center of a research group at Chalmers University of Technology, which has developed a method to easily remove pollutants from water. The group, led by Gunnar Westman, Associate Professor of Organic Chemistry focuses on new uses for cellulose and wood-based products and is part of the Wallenberg Wood Science Center.The researchers have built up solid knowledge about cellulose nanocrystals\u2014and this is where the key to water purification lies. These tiny nanoparticles have an outstanding adsorption capacity, which the researchers have now found a way to utilize.\"We have taken a unique holistic approach to these cellulose nanocrystals, examining their properties and potential applications. We have now created a biobased material, a form of cellulose powder with excellent purification properties that we can adapt and modify depending on the types of pollutants to be removed,\" says Gunnar Westman.Absorbs and breaks down toxinsIn a study recently published in the scientific journal Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research, the researchers show how toxic dyes can be filtered out of wastewater using the method and material developed by the group. The research was conducted in collaboration with the Malaviya National Institute of Technology Jaipur in India, where dye pollutants in textile industry wastewater are a widespread problem.The treatment requires neither pressure nor heat and uses sunlight to catalyze the process. Gunnar Westman likens the method to pouring raspberry juice into a glass with grains of rice, which soak up the juice to make the water transparent again.\"Imagine a simple purification system, like a portable box connected to the sewage pipe. As the contaminated water passes through the cellulose powder filter, the pollutants are absorbed and the sunlight entering the treatment system causes them to break down quickly and efficiently. It is a cost-effective and simple system to set up and use, and we see that it could be of great benefit in countries that currently have poor or non-existent water treatment,\" he says.      The method will be tested in IndiaIndia is one of the developing countries in Asia with extensive textile production, where large amounts of dyes are released into lakes, rivers and streams every year. The consequences for humans and the environment are serious. Water contaminant contains dyes and heavy metals and can cause skin damage with direct contact and increase the risk of cancer and organ damage when they enter into the food chain. Additionally, nature is affected in several ways, including the impairment of photosynthesis and plant growth.Conducting field studies in India is an important next step, and the Chalmers researchers are now supporting their Indian colleagues in their efforts to get some of the country's small-scale industries to test the method in reality. So far, laboratory tests with industrial water have shown that more than 80% of the dye pollutants are removed with the new method, and Gunnar Westman sees good opportunities to further increase the degree of purification.\"Going from discharging completely untreated water to removing 80% of the pollutants is a huge improvement, and means significantly less destruction of nature and harm to humans. In addition, by optimizing the pH and treatment time, we see an opportunity to further improve the process so that we can produce both irrigation and drinking water. It would be fantastic if we can help these industries to get a water treatment system that works, so that people in the surrounding area can use the water without risking their health,\" he says.Can be used against other types of pollutantsGunnar Westman also sees great opportunities to use cellulose nanocrystals for the treatment of other water pollutants than dyes. In a previous study, the research group has shown that pollutants of toxic hexavalent chromium, which is common in wastewater from mining, leather and metal industries, could be successfully removed with a similar type of cellulose-based material. The group is also exploring how the research area can contribute to the purification of antibiotic residues.\"There is great potential to find good water purification opportunities with this material, and in addition to the basic knowledge we have built up at Chalmers, an important key to success is the collective expertise available at the Wallenberg Wood Science Center,\" he says.

  "text": "A team of chemists, engineers, material scientists and physicists from Princeton University, Rutgers University and the University of Regensburg has developed a chemical exfoliation technique to produce single-molecule-thick tungsten disulfide ink. The group describes their technique in a paper published in the journal Science Advances.          As research continues into the creation of truly useful quantum computers, scientists continue to search for new materials that could support such machines. In this new effort, the research team looked into finding ways to print very cold circuits inside quantum computers using superconducting ink.The new method involved a material consisting of layers of tungsten disulfide and potassium. The researchers exfoliated the material by dunking it into a sulfuric acid solution. This dissolved the potassium and left behind single-molecule layers of tungsten disulfide. The final step involved rinsing the acid and remnants in it, leaving the layers of tungsten suspended in a tub of water. In this state, the researchers found that the layers of tungsten disulfide could be used as a form of ink that could be printed onto various types of surfaces, such as plastic, silicon or glass. This left a one-molecule-thick coating on the material.The coating held stable at room temperature without the need for a protective coating for 30 days. Cooling it to 7.3K made the coating superconductive, even after it was left in the open air for a period of time. The research team notes that this suggests that the ink could be carried around without the need for special equipment to a site where it could then be frozen for use as a superconductor. They further suggest that due to the simplicity of the process, it should be quite easy to industrialize it.They conclude that the ink could be used in quantum computers or MRI machines where parts would already be chilled to the necessary temperatures. The team next plans to test the possibility of using a similar process to create superconductive coatings at higher temperatures.

  "answer_squad": " composite material",
  "text": "Researchers from the University of Twente developed a new composite material that outperforms the individual compounds by one to two orders of magnitude. The composite consists of several earth-abundant elements, that could potentially be used for efficient hydrogen generation without rare and precious metals like platinum. The researchers published their findings in the journal ACS Nano.          Green hydrogen is seen as the energy carrier of the future. Effectively, hydrogen offers a way to store (green) energy for long periods. This makes it especially important to produce it as efficiently as possible. Electrolysis of water is one of the most sustainable methods to produce green hydrogen. However, with current electrolysis methods, we need a lot of rare and expensive materials, or the process is not efficient enough.\"Currently, the most efficient electrolyzers contain platinum and iridium, which are needed for the electrodes on which the hydrogen and oxygen gas are produced from water. However, platinum and especially iridium are too rare. That's why we're constantly looking for electrode materials made from more abundant resources which also can be used as efficient and stable electrocatalysts,\" explains UT-researcher Chris Baeumer. The researcher and his team found exactly what they were looking for in a new material, which is a compound containing five different transition metals.Individually, the five transition metals are only moderately active when used as a catalyst. However, the researchers found that the combined activity outperforms the individual compounds by a factor up to 680. The higher activity comes as a surprise, explains Baeumer.\"We expected that the stability compared to traditional composites would be enhanced, but when we started testing it soon turned out that the activity was much higher too. In collaboration with our partners from Karlsruhe (Germany) and Berkeley (U.S.), we found that the individual transition metals may 'help' each other to make the combined material better than the sum of its parts in a so-called synergy-effect.\"These new findings don't mean that we can directly replace all electrodes with this new material. Combining the five different materials is complex, and the activity was so far tested only in a lab-environment.\"We're comparing a newly discovered composite to materials optimized for large-scale production, meaning that our new material still needs to be tested on the industrial scale. However, with some tweaking and further research, this combination of transition metals has the potential to outperform currently available alternatives,\" explains UT-postdoc Shu Ni, who is leading these future developments for materials optimization.

  "text": "The synthesis of multifunctional nanoparticles is commonly a complex endeavor and hampers the clinical translation of effective nanomedicines. In their most recent work, Matthias Barz and coworkers present a microfluidic setup for the continuous production of drug-loaded core cross-linked polymeric micelles (CCPMs) in a single precisely controlled process. The study is published in the journal Advanced Materials.       The project was performed in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, the University of Oslo, and the Fraunhofer Institute for Microengineering and Microsystems (IMM) in Mainz. While Kaloian Koynov and his team helped to characterize the formed CCPMs in biological fluids, the team of the IMM lead by Michael Maskos contributed their immense expertise on microfluidics to develop this unique setup combining two slit interdigital micromixers and a tangential flow filtration unit.The system enables the controlled formation of micelles in mixer one, the precise core cross-linking in the second mixer, followed by the purification via tangential flow filtration, which removes remaining crosslinkers, unimers, and trances of organic solvents to yield purified functional CCPMs. Combined with functional (prodrug-containing) cross-linkers the process enables the continuous production of drug-loaded CCPMs under specifically controlled conditions, which substantially eases library synthesis, scale-up, certified production, and the clinical translation of lead candidates.In a first study, the synthesized Paclitaxel-containing CCPMs showed therapeutic efficiency in a B16F10 melanoma model and outperformed the approved Paclitaxel formulation Abraxane, which underlines the therapeutic potential of CCPMs based on polypept(o)ides and microfluidic systems.

  "text": "Plants use photosynthesis to harvest energy from sunlight. Now researchers at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have applied this principle as the basis for developing new sustainable processes which in the future may produce syngas (synthetic gas) for the large-scale chemical industry and be able to charge batteries.          Syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, is an important intermediate product in the manufacture of many chemical starter materials such as ammonia, methanol and synthetic hydrocarbon fuels. \"Syngas is currently made almost exclusively using fossil raw materials,\" says Prof. Roland Fischer from the Chair of Inorganic and Organometallic Chemistry.A yellow powder, developed by a research team led by Fischer, is to change all that. The scientists were inspired by photosynthesis, the process plants use to produce chemical energy from light. \"Nature needs carbon dioxide and water for photosynthesis,\" says Fischer. The nanomaterial developed by the researchers imitates the properties of the enzymes involved in photosynthesis. The \"nanozyme\" produces syngas using carbon dioxide, water and light in a similar manner.Record values for efficiencyDr. Philip Stanley, who addressed the topic as part of his doctoral thesis, explains, \"A molecule takes over the task of an energy antenna, analogous to a chlorophyll molecule in plants. Light is received and the electrons are passed on to a reaction center, the catalyst.\"The innovative aspect of the researchers' system is that there are now two reaction centers which are linked to the antenna. One of these centers converts carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide, while the other turns water into hydrogen. The major design challenge was to arrange the antenna, the mechanism for passing on the electrons and the two catalysts, in such a way that the highest possible yield is achieved from the light.And the team accomplished this. \"At 36 percent, our energy yield from light is spectacularly high,\" says Stanley. \"We succeed in converting as much as one third of the photons into chemical energy. Previous systems often attained every tenth photon at best. This result raises hopes that the technical realization could make industrial chemical processes more sustainable.\"Photo accumulator to store chargesIn a separate project the researchers are working on another material which uses light energy from the sun\u2014but in this case stores it as electric energy. \"One possible future application could be batteries which are charged by sunlight, without the detour through the wall socket,\" says Fischer.The researchers used components similar to those in the nanozyme when developing these photo accumulators. Here too the material itself absorbs photons from the incident light. But instead of then serving as a catalyst for a chemical reaction, the energy receiver is so tightly integrated in the structure that it remains in this state, making storage of the electrons over a longer period of time possible. The researchers have demonstrated the feasibility of the system in the lab.\"There are two ways to make direct use of solar energy,\" says Dr. Julien Warnan, group leader for photocatalysis. \"Either we harvest electric energy from it or we use the energy to push chemical reactions. And these two systems, both based on the same principle, show that we've succeeded experimentally.\"The study is published in the journal Advanced Materials. More information:Philip M.

  "text": "Carbon fiber composites are preferred structural materials due to their high specific strength and modulus. Laminated construction of carbon composites and anisotropic nature, though, leave them sensitive to external loading. Since a brittle matrix controls the properties in and out of plane direction, interlaminar resin-rich regions are particularly susceptible to matrix cracking. Such incipient damage eventually evolves into life-limiting fracture, such as delamination under Mode II loading.          Several techniques have been employed to arrest crack genesis and propagation, thereby improving the damage resistance of composites. One of the most promising approaches is to modify epoxy with nanoparticles because of their high surface area to volume ratio and capability to counter micron scale cracks. However, nanoparticles are intricately associated with agglomeration in microstructure that can serve as embrittled damage initiation sites.Electrospun short nylon 6 nanofibers (figure a) were proposed as an alternative epoxy reinforcement since their bulk mechanical properties were comparable to those of epoxy. High surface area and aspect ratio nanofibers were expected to introduce energy absorbing interfaces and nano-scale toughness mechanisms (figure b). Fabrication involved spinning and shortening of nanofibers followed by modification of epoxy to fabricate carbon fiber composite using vacuum bagging. Samples were tested under quasi-static indentation loading in accordance with ASTM D6264/D6264M-17.Results showed an improvement of 8.7, 8.8, and 53% in peak force, displacement and elastic toughness at optimum nanofiber concentration. External directional damage growth was suppressed, and damage area increased marginally. At optimum nanofiber concentration, delaminated area reduced by 12.6%. Suppression of compressive fiber failure and enhanced interlaminar bonding were credited to offer superior performance.These newly developed electrospun nanofiber-reinforced carbon composites attempt to address the classical issue of poor damage resistance of composites commonly reported in aerospace, marine and automotive applications. Improvement in damage resistance is likely to reduce non-destructive inspection's costs and adoption of composite structures with low safety factor.The work was led by Usaid Ahmed Shakil, at Centre for Advanced Composite Materials (CACM), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, supported by six team members, namely Professors Shukur Bin Abu Hassan, Yazid Bin Yahya, Muhammad Asyraf Bin Muhammad Rizal, Ahmad Ilyas Bin Rushdan, Mat Uzir bin Wahit, from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, and Mohd Ruzaimi Mat Rejab, from Universiti Malaysia Pahang. It has been published in the journal Polymer Composites.Associate Professor Kheng Lim Goh of Newcastle University in Singapore, with expertise in Materials Technology, has acted as a technical advisor on this project. Associate Professor Goh remarks, \"Carbon fiber composites is now well adopted in the aircraft and automobile industries due to its high specific strength and stiffness, enabling the aircraft and vehicles to be more fuel efficient and cost effective. However, accidents are bound to happen and when this occurs, repair can be costly in terms of materials and turn around time. Modifying the carbon fiber composite to become more impact resistance is key to mitigating the problem.\"I am really pleased that the team has been very successful in developing this method for improving the impact properties of the carbon fiber composites. I am really pleased that the method and findings have been published.\" More information:Usaid Ahmed Shakil et al, Electrospun short nanofibers to improve damage resistance of carbon fiber composites, Polymer Composites (2023).

The material, zinc oxide, could be incorporated into many components of future technologies including mobile phones and computers, thanks to its versatility and recent advances in nanotechnology, according to the team.RMIT University's Associate Professor Enrico Della Gaspera and Dr. Joel van Embden led a team of global experts to review production strategies, capabilities and potential applications of zinc oxide nanocrystals in the journal Chemical Reviews.Professor Silvia Gross from the University of Padova in Italy and Associate Professor Kevin Kittilstved from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the United States are co-authors.\"Progress in nanotechnology has enabled us to greatly improve and adapt the properties and performances of zinc oxide by making it super small, and with well-defined features,\" said Della Gaspera, from RMIT's School of Science.\"Tiny and versatile particles of zinc oxide can now be prepared with exceptional control of their size, shape and chemical composition at the nanoscale,\" said van Embden, also from RMIT's School of Science.\"This all leads to precise control of the resulting properties for countless applications in optics, electronics, energy, sensing technologies and even microbial decontamination.\"Sky's the limit with spray-on electronicsThe zinc oxide nanocrystals can be formulated into ink and deposited as an ultra-thin coating. The process is like ink-jet printing or airbrush painting, but the coating is hundreds to thousands of times thinner than a conventional paint layer.\"These coatings can be made highly transparent to visible light, yet also highly electrically conductive\u2014two fundamental characteristics needed for making touchscreen displays,\" Della Gaspera said.The nanocrystals can also be deposited at low temperature, allowing coatings on flexible substrates, such as plastic, that are resilient to flexing and bending, the team says.The team is ready to work with industry to explore potential applications using their techniques to make these nanomaterial coatings.      What is zinc oxide and how can it be used?Zinc is an abundant element in the Earth's crust and more abundant than many other technologically relevant metals, including tin, nickel, lead, tungsten, copper and chromium.\"Zinc is cheap and widely used by various industries already, with global annual production in the millions of tons,\" van Embden said.Zinc oxide is an extensively studied material, with initial scientific studies being conducted from the beginning of the 20th century.\"Zinc oxide gained a lot of interest in the 1970s and 1980s due to progress in the semiconductor industry. And with the advent of nanotechnology and advancement in both syntheses and analysis techniques, zinc oxide has rapidly risen as one of the most important materials of this century,\" Della Gaspera said.Zinc oxide is also safe, biocompatible and found already in products such as sunscreens and cosmetics.Potential applications, other than bendable electronics, that could use zinc oxide nanocrystals include:self-cleaning coatingsantibacterial and antifungal agentssensors to detect ultraviolet radiationelectronic components in solar cells and light emitting devices (LED)transistors, which are miniature components that control electrical signals and are the foundation of modern electronics sensors that could be used to detect harmful gases for residential, industrial and environmental applications.Next stepsScaling up the team's approach from the lab to an industrial setting would require working with the right partners, Della Gaspera said.\"Scalability is a challenge for all types of nanomaterials, zinc oxide included,\" he said.\"Being able to recreate the same conditions that we achieve in the laboratory, but with much larger reactions, requires both adapting the type of chemistry used and engineering innovations in the reaction setup.\"In addition to these scalability challenges, the team needs to address the shortfall in electrical conductivity that nanocrystal coatings have when compared to industrial benchmarks, which rely on more complex physical depositions. The intrinsic structure of the nanocrystal coatings, which enables more flexibility, limits the ability of the coating to conduct electricity efficiently.\"We and other scientists around the world are working towards addressing these challenges and good progress is being made,\" Della Gaspera said.He sees great opportunities to collaborate with other organizations and industry partners to tackle these kinds of challenges.\"I am confident that, with the right partnership, these challenges can be solved,\" Della Gaspera said.The RMIT team has contributed to other peer-reviewed research on zinc oxide nanocrystals in recent years, including:the synthesis of nanocrystals with unprecedented control of their size and chemical compositionan innovative way to improve the conductivity of coatings at low temperaturesthe use of nanocrystals as antibacterial and antifungal agents.More information:Joel van Embden et al, Colloidal Approaches to Zinc Oxide Nanocrystals, Chemical Reviews (2022).

The biosynthesis of functional nanoparticles with the regulation of marine microorganisms has especially attracted much attention.          Recently, a research team led by Assoc. Prof. Zhai Xiaofan from the Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IOCAS), cooperating with Prof. Tang Xuexi from Ocean University of China (OUC), reported a colorimetric sensor based on zinc phosphate hydrate nanosheets (SA@ZnPNS).The study was published in Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces on March 6.The researchers proposed a novel biosynthesis strategy of SA@ZnPNS using Shewanella algae, which was efficient, environmentally friendly, and low cost. SA@ZnPNS was characterized and optimized by two important parameters of pH value and precursors concentration. SA@ZnPNS showed an excellent peroxidase-like activity which can catalyze H2O2 to \u00b7OH and then turn 3,3,'5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to oxidation state, causing a color variation to blue.Based on the properties of SA@ZnPNS, a fast colorimetric method for dopamine (DA) quantitative analysis was proposed. The detection mechanism was clarified as DA consumed quantified \u00b7OH and caused a lightened blue color of reaction system.

  "text": "The human body is made up of thousands of tiny lymphatic vessels that ferry white blood cells and proteins around the body, like a superhighway of the immune system. It's remarkably efficient, but if damaged from injury or cancer treatment, the whole system starts to fail. The resulting fluid retention and swelling, called lymphedema, isn't just uncomfortable\u2014it's also irreversible.          When lymphatic vessels fail, typically their ability to pump out the fluid is compromised. Georgia Institute of Technology researchers have developed a new treatment using nanoparticles that can repair lymphatic vessel pumping. Traditionally, researchers in the field have tried to regrow lymphatic vessels, but repairing the pumping action is a unique approach.\"With many patients, the challenge is that the lymphatic vessels that still exist in the patient aren't working. So it's not that you need to grow new vessels that you can think of as tubes, it's that you need to get the tubes to work, which for lymphatic vessels means to pump,\" said Brandon Dixon, a professor in the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering. \"That's where our approach is really different. It delivers a drug to help lymphatic vessels pump using a nanoparticle that can drain into the diseased vessels themselves.\"The researchers published their findings, titled \"Lymphatic-Draining Nanoparticles Deliver Bay K8644 Payload to Lymphatic Vessels and Enhance Their Pumping Function,\" in Science Advances in February.The benefit of nanotechnology for drug deliveryThe drug the researchers used, S-(-)-Bay K8644 or BayK, normally targets L-type calcium channels that enable the skeletal, cardiac, and endocrine muscles to contract. In effect, the application of BayK throughout the body would lead to convulsions and spasms.Using nanoparticles designed to drain into lymphatic vessels after injection focuses the drug solely into the lymphatic vessels, draining the injection site. As a result, the drug is available within lymphatic vessels at a locally high dose. When lymph is eventually returned into the circulation, it's diluted in the blood so much that it doesn't affect other systems in the body, making the drug for lymphedema applications both targeted and safe.\"Lymphatic tissues work like river basins\u2014regionally you have vessels that drain the fluid out of your tissues,\" said Susan Thomas, Woodruff Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering in the Parker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience. \"This method is like putting nanoparticles in the river to help the river flow better.\"The research is the perfect blend of Dixon's and Thomas's respective areas of expertise. Dixon's lab has been studying how lymphatics function in animal models for years. Thomas engineers nanoparticle drug delivery technologies that deploy in the lymphatic system.\"He develops analysis tools and disease models related to the lymphatic system, and I develop lymphatic-targeting drug delivery technologies,\" Thomas said. \"Tackling lymphedema as a widely prevalent condition for which there are no efficacious therapies was the perfect opportunity to leverage our strengths to hopefully move the needle on developing new strategies to serve this underserved patient population.\"Testing the therapyThe Dixon and Thomas lab teams tested the formulation using rodent models. They first mapped the model's lymph node system by injecting a fluorescent substance to see how it traveled. Then they applied a pressure cuff to measure how the lymphatic system fails to function when compromised. From there, they evaluated how formulating BayK in a lymph-draining nanoparticle influenced the drug's effects. The delivery system allowed the drug to act within the lymphatic vessel, as demonstrated by increased vessel pumping and restored pumping pressure, and drastically reduced the concentration of BayK in the blood, which is typically associated with unwanted side effects.The researchers are expanding the formulation to more advanced disease models to move it closer to human application. They will also explore how it can be used to prevent or treat lymphedema in combination with other existing or new therapies now being developed. More information:Lauren F.

  "text": "While it is a popular hobby for many, fishing is also a pastime full of uncertainty. Each time you have something on the line, you can never be completely sure what type of fish you've hooked until you pull it out of the water. In a similar way, scientists \"fishing\" for biomarkers\u2014molecules whose health care applications include signaling for the presence of cancer\u2014in biofluids such as blood can also encounter unpredictability. Finding a specific protein biomarker in a pool of thousands is like trying to catch a particular fish species in the vast ocean.          Luckily, a team of researchers from Syracuse University's College of Arts and Sciences (A&S), SUNY Upstate Medical University, Ichor Therapeutics, and Clarkson University have devised a tiny, nano-sized sensor capable of detecting protein biomarkers in a sample at single-molecule precision. Fittingly coined as \"hook and bait,\" a tiny protein binder fuses to a small hole created in the membrane of a cell\u2014known as a nanopore\u2014which allows ionic solution to flow through it. When the sensor recognizes a targeted molecule, the ionic flow changes. This change in flow serves as the signal from the sensor that the biomarker has been found.\"These nanopores are equipped with hooks that pull certain protein biomarkers from a solution,\" says Liviu Movileanu, professor of physics in A&S, who co-authored the study along with postdoctoral researcher Mohammad Ahmad. \"By fishing them from the solution quickly and accurately, we can better identify and quantify protein biomarkers that are associated with various hematological malignancies and solid tumors.\"The team's latest research, published in Nature Communications, addresses previous challenges that existed in making this technology generalizable. Their new findings formulate a sensor design architecture that can be applied to a broad range of protein targets.Combining innovative technologiesFor the first time, the team coupled nanopore technology with antibody mimetic technology\u2014artificially designed protein scaffolds that bind and interact with a specific biomarker and behave like antibodies. Cells inside the body design their own antibodies which bind to and eliminate unwanted substances. When it comes to therapeutics, scientists engineer small proteins to penetrate cells and stimulate the production of antibodies which target specific pathogens like viruses or bacteria.\"Researchers design the scaffolds using established scaffolds from mother nature and adapt them using evolutionary mutagenesis\u2014where they scan billions of DNA mutations until they find some that interact strongly with a specific protein,\" says Movileanu. \"Creating highly specific protein detection technologies will address these demands and also accelerate discoveries of new biomarkers with potential consequences for the progression of pathological conditions.\"According to Movileanu, in addition to working in a clean solution, the sensor is also highly effective in complex biofluids, like blood serum, that contain numerous antibodies.\"Essentially you have a very specific hook that targets a very specific protein,\" he explains. \"Since the signal encodes the exact protein that you are targeting, this technique does not have false positives, making it practical for biomedical diagnostics.\"To validate their findings, the team tested their hypothesis using a blood serum sample. With their technology, they were able to identify and quantify epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a protein biomarker in various cancers. In addition, numerous calibrations of the sensors were conducted using other biophysical techniques.At the forefront of diagnosisWhile their paper provides a concept prototype, Movileanu says the project paves the way for broad applications. For example, by integrating the sensors into nanofluidic devices, this technology would allow scientists to test for many different biomarkers at once in a specimen, providing a fundamental basis for biomarker detection in complex biofluids.\"The future of medicine won't rely as much on imaging and biopsies when diagnosing cancers,\" says Movileanu. \"Instead, researchers will use nanosensor technology, like what we are developing in our lab, to test blood samples for the presence of various biomarkers associated with different cancers. This research is critical to the future of prognostics, diagnostics and therapeutics.\" More information:Mohammad Ahmad et al, A generalizable nanopore sensor for highly specific protein detection at single-molecule precision,Nature Communications (2023).

  "question_squad": " What is the goal of the s-SWCNTs?",
  "answer_squad": " to optimize the performance of s-SWCNT film photodetectors",
  "text": "Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWCNTs) are being used to develop a third generation of optimized shortwave infrared photodetectors that will improve pixel size, weight, power consumption, performance and cost over photodetectors made from traditional materials.          Ultrasensitive shortwave infrared photodetectors, which detect a subset of shortwave infrared light wavelengths outside of the visual spectrum, have many potential applications, including night surveillance, navigation during poor weather conditions, fiber optic communications and semiconductor quality control.Shortwave infrared photodetectors have traditionally been made out of III-V materials like indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs). InGaAs photodetectors are expensive, however, and current research into alternative photodetector materials, such as s-SWCNTs, will ideally reduce the cost of shortwave infrared photodetectors while increasing both performance and efficiency.A team of leading scientists from Peking University outlined the current technology and challenges associated with developing s-SWCNT films into shortwave infrared photodetectors to spur additional research and applications of the technology. Current advances in solution purification technology will facilitate the development of high-purity s-SWCNT films suitable for large-area, homogenous and high-performance optoelectronic devices and applications that detect and process light, including photodetectors.Further optimization of film purity, thickness, clarity and array alignment must be achieved before s-SWCNT films will meet or exceed the performance level of traditional, more expensive photodetectors made of InGaAs or similar materials.The team published their review in the March 16 issue of Nano Research Energy.\"Reviewing the progress of the s-SWCNTs film photodetectors can clarify the current research status, challenges and applications of s-SWCNT film photodetectors and optoelectronic integration,\" said Sheng Wang, one of the authors of the review paper and associate professor at the School of Electronics at Peking University, China.\"We outlined s-SWCNT technology in three sections: (1) the current research status of the s-SWCNT film photodetectors, (2) the current research status of monolithic/three-dimension optoelectronic integration based on s-SWCNT film photodetectors and (3) the requirements of s-SWCNT film and device structure for ideal s-SWCNT film photodetectors and optoelectronic integration,\" said Wang.      \"The next step in the field is to improve the performance of s-SWCNT film photodetectors by optimizing the s-SWCNT films and device structure. For the s-SWCNT film optimization, the semiconductor purity of a uniform s-SWCNT film needs to be greater than 99.9999%,\" said Wang.Achieving these purity levels is not a trivial matter. Early purification methods attempted to burn off s-SWCNT impurities after films were grown but resulted in films with many defects. Since then, conjugated polymers have been used to purify s-SWCNTs not only from impurities, but also by their diameter, as different diameters of s-SWCNT determine which wavelengths the films can detect. Recently, a sorting process has achieved the s-SWCNT purity levels required for high-performance electronics.Optimization is also required in s-SWCNT film preparation, including thickness, clarity and alignment. Many methods have been developed to grow s-SWCNT films, but deposition and dip-coating methods are often favored for their simplicity, stability and the homogenous films they produce. One scalable and efficient method of dip coating controls s-SWCNT deposition by simply modifying the number of times a substrate is lifted out of an organic solvent of dispersed s-SWCNTs and the speed of each lift.The electronics field recognizes the potential of s-SWCNTs as a suitable material for high-performance shortwave infrared detectors, but a significant performance gap exists between traditional photodetectors, made of materials such as InGaAs, and s-SWCNT film photodetectors. \"The ultimate goal is to optimize the performance of s-SWCNT film photodetectors, so they are comparable to commercial photodetectors at a lower cost,\" said Wang.The researchers believe this increase in performance and decrease in cost will result in the integration of more shortwave infrared photodetector films into devices and the development of new optoelectronic applications in the future. The field also aspires to integrate high-performance carbon nanotubes in electric circuits.

  "text": "Accurately reconstructing how the parts of a complex molecular are held together knowing only how the molecule distorts and breaks up\u2014this was the challenge taken on by a research team led by SISSA's Cristian Micheletti and recently published on Physical Review Letters. In particular, the scientists studied how a DNA double helix unzips when translocated at high velocity through a nanopore, reconstructing fundamental DNA thermodynamic properties from the sole speed of the process.          The translocation of polymers through nanopores has long studied as a fundamental theoretical problem as well as for its several practical ramifications, e.g. for genome sequencing. We recall that the latter involves driving a DNA filament through a pore so narrow that only one of the double-helical strands can pass, while the other strand is left behind. As a result, the translocated DNA double helix will necessarily split and unwind, an effect known as unzipping.The research team, which also includes Antonio Suma from the University of Bari, first author, and Vincenzo Carnevale from Temple University, used a cluster of computers to simulate the process with different driving forces keeping track of the DNA's unzipping speed, a type of data that has rarely been studied despite being directly accessible in experiments.Using previously developed theoretical and mathematical models, researchers were able to work \"backwards\", using the information on the speed to accurately reconstruct the thermodynamics of the formation and rupture of the double-helix structure.\"Previous theories\", the researchers explain, \"set off from detailed knowledge of the thermodynamics of a molecular system which was then used to predict the response to more or less invasive external stresses. This alone is a major challenge in itself. We looked at the inverse problem: we started from the DNA's response to aggressive stresses, such as the forced unzipping of the double helix, to recover the details of the thermodynamics.\"\"Due to the invasive and rapid nature of the unzipping process, the project seemed doomed to fail, and that was probably why it had never been tried before. However, we also knew that the right theoretical and mathematical models, if applicable, could offer us a promising solution to the problem. After analyzing the extensive set of collected data, we were very thrilled to discover that this was exactly the case; we were happy we had the right intuition.\"The technique adopted in the study is general, and thus the researchers expect to be able to extend it beyond DNA to other molecular systems that are still relatively unexplored. A case in point are the so-called molecular motors, protein aggregates that use energy to make cyclic transformations, very much like the engines in our everyday life.\"Up until now\", researchers stress, \"studies on molecular motors have started by formulating hypotheses on their thermodynamics and then comparing predictions with experimental data. The new method that we have validated should allow taking the inverse route, namely using data from out-of-equilibrium experiments to recover the thermodynamics, with clear conceptual and practical advantages.\" More information:Antonio Suma et al, Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics of DNA Nanopore Unzipping, Physical Review Letters (2023).

  "text": "Graphene's 2D nature, single molecule sensitivity, low noise, and high carrier concentration have generated a lot of interest in its application in gas sensors. However, due to its inherent non-selectivity, and huge p-doping in atmospheric air, its applications in gas sensing are often limited to controlled environments such as nitrogen, dry air, or synthetic humid air.          While humidity conditions in synthetic air could be used to achieve controlled hole doping of the graphene channel, this does not adequately mirror the situation in atmospheric air. Moreover, atmospheric air contains several gases with concentrations similar to or larger than the analytic gas. Such shortcomings of graphene-based sensors hinder selective gas detection and molecular species identification in atmospheric air, which is required for applications in environmental monitoring, and non-invasive medical diagnosis of ailments.The research team led by Dr. Manoharan Muruganathan (formerly Senior Lecturer), and Professor Hiroshi Mizuta at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST) employed the machine learning (ML) models trained on various gas adsorption-induced doping and scattering signals to realize both highly sensitive and selective gas sensing with a single device.The ML models' performances are often dependent on the input features. 'The conventional graphene-based ML models are limited in their input features', says Dr. Osazuwa Gabriel Agbonlahor (formerly post-doctoral research fellow). The existing ML models only monitor the gas adsorption-induced changes in the graphene transfer characteristics or resistance/conductivity without modulating these characteristics by applying an external electric field.Hence, they miss distinctive van der Waals (vdW) interaction between gas molecules and graphene, which is unique to individual gas molecules. Hence, unlike the conventional electronic nose (e-nose) models, we can map the external electric field modulated graphene-gas interaction, which enables more selective feature extraction for complex gas environments such as atmospheric air.Our ML models for the identification of atmospheric gases were developed using the graphene sensor functionalized with a porous activated carbon thin film. Eight vdW complex features were used to monitor the effects of the external electric field on the graphene-gas molecule vdW interaction, and consequently mapped the evolution of the vdW bonding before, during, and after the external electric field application.Furthermore, although the gas sensing experiments were performed under different experimental conditions e.g., gas chamber pressures, gas concentrations, ambient temperature, atmospheric relative humidity, tuning time, and tuning voltage, the developed models were shown to be robust enough to accommodate these variations in experimental conditions by not exposing the models to these parameters.Moreover, to test the models versatility, they were trained on atmospheric environments as well as relatively inert environments that are often used in gas sensing e.g., nitrogen and dry air. Hence, a high-performance atmospheric gas \"electronic nose\" was achieved, distinguishing between the four different environments (ammonia in atmospheric air, acetone in atmospheric air, acetone in nitrogen, and ammonia in dry air) with 100% accuracy.The research is published in the journal Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical.

  "answer_squad": " OAM",
  "text": "The Fourth Industrial Revolution is driving exponential growth in data transmission, and cost-effective, ultrafast, and compact optical communication technologies are urgently needed to manage the exploding data transmission volume. Vortex beams, which exhibit a swirling shape around the axis of propagation, have the potential to increase the amount of information that can be stored at the same frequency.          As such, they represent a promising avenue for the development of high-capacity optical communication technologies that surpass 5G and pave the way for 6G. To that end, a research team at Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) has developed a vortex beam capable of functioning with a wide range of light frequencies through the use of a metasurface.The findings are published in the journal Nano Letters.Professor Junsuk Rho (Department of Mechanical Engineering, and Chemical Engineering), along with Ph.D. candidate Joohoon Kim (Department of Mechanical Engineering), led the team that proposed a metasurface capable of independently controlling two orthogonal polarization states across the ultraviolet to visible light broadband wavelengths. In addition, the researchers demonstrated the ability to create and detect vortex beams with different topological charges using the metasurface.Orbital angular momentum (OAM) is a term used to describe the swirling pattern that light takes on as it travels. When light assumes this swirling pattern, it is called a vortex beam. Vortex beams can store more information at the same frequency or polarization state than conventional light beams can.The independent vortex beam of optical vortex beams has made them an essential tool in optics with various applications, including optical tweezers and creating holographic videos. However, creating optical vortex beams has traditionally required bulky and heavy equipment called spatial light modulators (SLMs). Additionally, introducing ultraviolet optical vortex beams has been challenging due to the lack of SLMs that work in this range.Recent advances in nanofabrication technology have enabled the realization of high-efficiency, broadband, and multifunctional metasurfaces capable of modulating many light properties, including phase, amplitude, and polarization. However, despite these advances and ongoing research effort, controlling light in the ultraviolet range remains a challenge.The research team opted for a thin and lightweight metasurface to create a polarizer capable of generating optical vortex beams when exposed to ultraviolet light, as opposed to the bulky and heavy SLMs traditionally used for this purpose. The researchers used silicon nitride, a material with a high refractive index and no absorption of ultraviolet light.One of the limitations of metasurfaces is that their function is permanently fixed once they are processed, making them difficult to modify. In this study, however, the team broke the rotational symmetry of the metasurface to design it with different functions depending on the polarization of the incoming light. This approach allows for more information to be stored on a single metasurface, opening up potential applications in various fields.Professor Rho explained, \"Our research confirmed the multifunctionality of metasurfaces, which can create optical vortex beams with different topological charges based on the polarization state of the incoming light. The creation of ultraviolet optical vortex beams also expands the potential applications of optical vortex beams.\" More information:Nasir Mahmood et al, Ultraviolet\u2013Visible Multifunctional Vortex Metaplates by Breaking Conventional Rotational Symmetry, Nano Letters (2023).

  "text": "A new process that lets scientists chemically cut apart and stitch together nanoscopic layers of two-dimensional materials\u2014like a tailor altering a suit\u2014could be just the tool for designing the technology of a sustainable energy future. Researchers from Drexel University, China and Sweden, have developed a method for structurally splitting, editing and reconstituting layered materials, called MAX phases and MXenes, with the potential of producing new materials with very unusual compositions and exceptional properties.          A \"chemical scissor\" is a chemical designed to react with a specific compound to break a chemical bond. The original set of chemical scissors, designed to break carbon-hydrogen bonds in organic molecules, was reported more than a decade ago.In a paper recently published in Science, the international team reported on a method to sharpen the scissors so that they can cut through extremely strong and stable layered nanomaterials in a way that breaks atomic bonds within a single atomic plane, then substitutes new elements\u2014fundamentally altering the material's composition in a single chemical \"snip.\"\"This research opens a new era of materials science, enabling atomistic engineering of two-dimensional and layered materials,\" said Yury Gogotsi, Ph.D., Distinguished University professor and Bach chair in Drexel's College of Engineering, who was an author of the research. \"We are showing a way to assemble and disassemble these materials like LEGO blocks, which will lead to the development of exciting new materials that have not even been predicted to be able to exist until now.\"Gogotsi and his collaborators at Drexel have been studying the properties of a family of layered nanomaterials called MXenes, that they discovered in 2011. MXenes begin as a precursor material called a MAX phase; \"MAX\" is a chemical portmanteau signifying the three layers of the material: M, A, and X. Applying a strong acid to the MAX phase chemically etches away the A layer, creating a more porously layered material\u2014with an A-less moniker: MXene.The discovery came on the heels of worldwide excitement about a two-dimensional nanomaterial called graphene, posited to be the strongest material in existence when the team of researchers who discovered it won the Nobel prize in 2010. Graphene's discovery expanded the search for other atomically thin materials with extraordinary properties\u2014like MXenes.      Drexel's team has been assiduously exploring the properties of MXene materials, leading to discoveries about its exceptional electrical conductivity, durability and ability to attract and filter chemical compounds, among others. But in some ways, the potential for MXenes has been capped from their inception by the way they're produced and the limited set of MAX phases and etchants that can be used to create them.\"Previously we could only produce new MXenes by adjusting the chemistry of the MAX phase or the acid used to etch it,\" Gogotsi said. \"While this allowed us to create dozens of MXenes, and predict that many dozen more could be created, the process did not allow for a great deal of control or precision.\"By contrast, the process that the team\u2014led by Gogotsi and Qing Huang, Ph.D., a professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences\u2014reported in its Science paper explains that, \"chemical scissor-mediated structural editing of layered transition metal carbides,\" is more like performing surgery, according to Gogotsi.The first step is using a Lewis acidic molten salt (LAMS) etching protocol that removes the A layer, as usual, but is also able to replace it with another element, such as chlorine. This is significant because it puts the material in a chemical state such that its layers can be sliced apart using a second set of chemical scissors, composed of a metal, such as zinc.These layers are the raw materials of MAX phases, which means the addition of a bit of chemical \"mortar\"\u2014a process called intercalation\u2014lets the team build their own MAX phases, which can then be used to create new MXenes, tailored to enhance specific properties.\"This process is like making a surgical cut of the MAX structure, peeling apart the layers and then reconstructing it with new and different metal layers,\" Gogotsi said. \"In addition to being able to produce new and unusual chemistries, which is interesting fundamentally, we can also make new and different MAX phases and use them to produce MXenes that are tailored to optimize various properties.\"In addition to building new MAX phases, the team also reported on using the method to create MXenes that can host new \"guest atoms\" that it previously would not have been chemically able to accommodate\u2014further expanding the family of MXene materials.\"We expect this work to lead to a major expansion of the already very large space of layered and two-dimensional materials,\" Gogotsi said. \"New MXenes that could not be produced from conventional MAX precursors are becoming possible. Of course, new materials with unusual structure and properties are expected to enable new technologies.\"The next step for this research, according to Gogotsi, is the delamination of two- and three-dimensional layered carbides, as well as metal intercalated two-dimensional carbides, into single- and few-layer nanosheets. This will allow the researchers to characterize their fundamental properties to optimize the new materials for use in energy storage, electronics and other applications.

  "text": "A novel cancer therapeutic, combining antibody fragments with molecularly engineered nanoparticles, permanently eradicated gastric cancer in treated mice, a multi-institutional team of researchers found.          The results of the \"hit and run\" drug delivery system, published in the March issue of Advanced Therapeutics, were the culmination of more than five years of collaboration between Cornell, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca.\"I've seen beautiful results before, but I've never seen something that eradicates a tumor like this,\" said study co-lead author Dr. Michelle Bradbury, MSKCC director of intraoperative imaging and professor of radiology at Weill Cornell Medicine.The other co-lead authors are Ulrich Wiesner, the Spencer T. Olin Professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, at Cornell Engineering; and J. Anand Subramony, vice president of protein engineering research and development at AstraZeneca at the time of the study.Targeted cancer treatments such as antibody and nanoparticle therapies have seen narrow clinical use because of each therapy's limitations, but the new therapeutic\u2014an evolution of what the researchers call Cornell prime dots, or C' dots\u2014combines the best attributes of both into an ultrasmall, powerfully effective system.As silica nanoparticles just 6 nanometers in size, C' dots are small enough to penetrate tumors and safely pass through organs once injected into the body. Wiesner first developed them more than 15 years ago and, in collaboration with Bradbury, published a 2018 study that found an antibody fragment-nanoparticle hybrid to be especially effective in finding tumors.This collaborative work with AstraZeneca set off the search for a new, molecularly engineered therapeutic version of this immuno-conjugate.AstraZeneca \"site engineered\" fragments of antibodies so they would effectively attach to the C' dots and target HER2 proteins associated with gastric cancer. The team optimized fragment conjugation to the C' dot surface, along with specialized inhibitor drugs developed by AstraZeneca. This enabled the nanoparticles to carry about five times more drugs than most antibodies.      The final product was a version of C' dots, armed with cancer-targeting antibody fragments and a large drug payload, all packed into a sub-7-nanometer, drug-immune conjugate therapy\u2014a first of its kind in that size class, according to the researchers.\"We describe the mode of action as 'hit and run,'\" Wiesner said, \"because the C' dots either target the tumor microenvironment and kill the tumor cells or get safely cleared out of the body via renal clearance as a result of their small size, thereby minimizing off-target accumulation and associated side effects and toxicity.\"Mice with gastric cancer received three doses of the therapeutic. Not only did the treatment eradicate the disease in every mouse, but there was no evidence of tumor recurrence after nearly 200 days.\"Usually you'd have to couple the treatment with other therapies to see those kind of long-term results,\" Bradbury said. \"It showed that the very detailed, careful work of this team\u2014the years spent on the stoichiometry and the surface chemical developments\u2014it paid off.\"Bradbury underscored the versatility of the C' dots platform, and said she envisions it being used not as a replacement for antibody treatments, but as a complementary tool that can be adapted to different types of cancers and other specific needs of patients.\"'C' dots have become unusually efficacious and safe in treating cancer. They completely obliterated the tumor, even at the cellular level,\" said Wiesner. \"This is what we ultimately had hoped for and it further supports our earlier decision to bet on therapeutic C' dot applications.\"Wiesner and Bradbury said the research behind the new C' dot therapeutic will be continued by Elucida Oncology, a startup company they founded to help bring the technology to market. They said that while Elucida is not using antibody fragments in their current clinical trial of C' dots, the work will help them build new conjugates that can potentially utilize such fragments in future trials.

  "text": "A biological method that produces metal nanoclusters using the electroactive bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens could provide a cheap and sustainable solution to high-performance catalyst synthesis for various applications such as water splitting.          Metal nanoclusters contain fewer than one hundred atoms and are much smaller than nanoparticles. They have unique electronic properties but also feature numerous active sites available for catalysis on their surface. There are several synthetic methods for making metal nanoclusters, but most require multiple steps involving toxic substances and harsh temperature and pressure conditions.Biological methods are expected to deliver ecofriendly alternatives to conventional chemical synthesis. Yet, to date, they have only led to large nanoparticles in a wide range of sizes. \"We found a way to control the size of the nanoclusters,\" says Rodrigo Jimenez-Sandoval, a Ph.D. candidate in Pascal Saikaly's group at KAUST.Having previously shown that the surface of electroactive bacterial cells could serve as a support for single metal atoms, Saikaly's team explored the creation of biohybrid materials. These consisted of palladium nanoclusters anchored to the bacterial surface of G. sulfurreducens cells. This bacterium, readily found in soil, can transfer electrons to metals present outside the cell and can also conduct electricity when grown on an electrode of a microbial electrochemical system. In this project, it acted as a reducing agent and a conductive scaffold for the nanoclusters.Credit: King Abdullah University of Science and TechnologyDrawing from nanoparticle chemical synthesis, the researchers decided to control the metal precursor concentration in their setup, and their attempt paid off, Jimenez-Sandoval says. \"To come up with this idea, we had to think of G. sulfurreducens as a chemical entity instead of a biological entity.\"They discovered that adding the metal precursor step by step was the key to fine-tuning nanocluster size and distribution and, ultimately, catalytic performance.As a proof of concept, the researchers evaluated the catalytic performance of the as-synthesized nanoclusters anchored to the bacterial surface for the overall water-splitting reaction, which involves electrochemically breaking down water into gaseous hydrogen and oxygen. The nanoclusters outperformed benchmark platinum- and iridium-based catalysts used for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline solutions.\"These results have very important implications in real life applications because a catalyst synthesized with a biological method is not only cheaper and simpler but also greener,\" Jimenez-Sandoval says.The study is published in the journal ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering.The team is now working to produce a biohybrid catalyst that does not rely on noble metals but a more abundant and cheaper material to enhance the sustainability of their strategy.

  "answer_squad": " EDTA",
  "text": "In order to deliver cancer therapeutics to tumor cells, the cells' membranes must be overcome. A team of researchers have discovered a simple way to achieve this using lipid nanoparticles containing the reagent EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid). As the team report in the journal Angewandte Chemie, an unusual mechanism of action of EDTA is responsible for this useful effect.          One of the greatest challenges in cancer therapy is the targeted delivery of drugs, contained in nanoparticles, to tumor cells, where they can then kill the cells. Unfortunately, cell membranes are highly selective in terms of what they allow to pass. Receptors on the membrane surface usually act as gatekeepers, but devising the precise molecular key to unlock them is tricky.Liposomes offer one alternative: these nanoscale lipid spheres simply fuse with the cell membrane, transporting their therapeutic payloads into the cell in the process. However, more efficient intracellular uptake is still sought to increase drug efficacy.Gang Zheng and colleagues at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and the University of Toronto, Canada, took a closer look at EDTA as a new way to gain entry to cancer cells. EDTA can chelate metal ions, in other words securely bind them and remove them from their environment. In biomedicine, EDTA is used to treat heavy metal poisoning, and it is used as a contrast agent for bioimaging.Zheng and the team hypothesized that the chelating effect might be useful as a cell opener too. As Zheng explains, \"A high concentration of EDTA is known to permeabilize bacterial membranes by chelating metals (e.g., calcium ions) on their membranes. We wondered whether incorporating an EDTA-lipid conjugate into liposomes could enhance their intracellular uptake at a much lower EDTA concentration that is non-toxic to human cells.\"The team therefore incorporated an EDTA-lipid compound into drug-loaded liposomes, in order to deliver them into tumor cells. The experimental results even exceeded their expectations, showing drastically improved internalization in both cell lines and in a mouse model. In tumor-infected mice, the drug\u2014porphyrins used for photodynamic therapy\u2014caused the tumor to decline and improved the surviving rates of the mice significantly.However, to the team's great surprise, the chelate effect had nothing to do with the enhanced internalization. \"This process is totally independent of its metal chelation properties,\" says Zheng of the team's findings. Instead, the group discovered that EDTA acted like a detergent to change the characteristics of the cell membrane, making it more fluid and flexible to promote nanoparticle uptake.The group now plan to apply this newly discovered mechanism to a general EDTA-lipid-based strategy for cells to absorb liposomal nanoparticles for enhanced therapy.

  "text": "Using solar energy to convert CO2 into synthetic fuels is currently one of the most promising technologies to achieve carbon neutrality with the embedment of sustainable energy into our modern economy. However, the efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 conversion is greatly limited due to the high thermodynamic stability of CO2 molecules and their multiple-electron-reduction process.          The synthesis of stable single-atom catalysts with high metal loading is desirable to boost photocatalytic CO2 performance, which, however, has remained a great challenge. To overcome this challenge, a study was performed by the groups of Prof. Yongfeng Zhou and Prof. Yiyong Mai (School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University).They developed a bottom-up synthetic strategy for the construction of ultrathin MOF nanosheets coordinated with Co single atoms, by directly using CoII tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (CoTCPP) as the linkers and Cu2\u2013(COO)4 paddlewheel cluster as the metal nodes. The bottom-up strategy avoids the tedious exfoliation processes and low yields encountered in top-down synthetic approach.Moreover, because the Co sites were coordinated within the porphyrin rings before the MOF formation, Co single atoms with a high loading of 6.0 wt.% were achieved on the MOF nanosheets. The obtained MOF nanosheets showed an ultrathin thickness of 2.4 \u00b1 0.5 nm and micron-sized lateral dimension.                a) TEM images of Co-MNSs (inset: high resolution TEM image showing the lattice information); b) AFM height profile of Co-MNSs, the heights of the sheets are marked; c) HAADF-STEM image of Co-MNSs, the yellow circles highlight the tiny bright spots in the nanosheets; d) Photocatalytic time-dependent CO and H2 yields by Co-MNSs; e) Comparison of CO2 photocatalytic performance under various reaction conditions; f) A proposed electronic band diagram for the photocatalytic system. Credit: Science China Press             Such a large aspect-ratio 2-D morphology coupled with the high content of Co single atoms enabled abundant accessible active sites on the catalyst surfaces, and also effectively inhibited the electron\u2013hole recombination by shortening the diffusion length of charge carriers from the material interior to the surface.As a catalyst for visible-light-driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction, Co-MNSs exhibited a high CO2-to-CO production rate of 7,041 \u03bcmol g\u22121 h \u22121 and a remarkable selectivity of 86% in aqueous media under \u03bb > 420 nm light irradiation, which is among the top-level performances of the reported MOF-based photocatalysts.

  "answer_squad": " nitridation",
  "text": "Two-dimensional monolayer nanosheets made from layered perovskite have many desirable properties. However, it has been difficult to create them with tunable bandgaps in the visible region without adding oxygen defects. Recently, researchers from Japan were able to successfully develop chemically stable nanosheets from perovskite oxynitrides which had controllable bandgaps. These nanosheets have immense potential for future use in photocatalysis, electrocatalysts, and other sustainable technologies.          Nanosheets, which include the well-known material graphene, are materials that possess nanoscale homogenous thicknesses, flat surfaces, and high crystallinity. Nanosheets have wide applications in photocatalysis, photoluminescence, and electronics.Recently, perovskites, which have semiconductor properties, have received attention in the scientific community as a promising material for producing two-dimensional (2D) monolayer nanosheets. However, these nanosheets would need have a bandgap corresponding to the energy of visible light to be useful, as this would determine when the semiconductor conducts electricity. The tunability of the bandgap has remained a major challenge for researchers, as creating 2D nanosheets from perovskite with a tunable bandgap is difficult.To solve this problem, a team of researchers from Kumamoto University, including Professor Shintaro Ida from the Institute of Industrial Nanomaterials, decided to focus on a group of perovskite materials known as Ruddlesden\u2013Popper (RP) phase layered perovskite oxynitrides. In their paper published in the journal Small, the researchers were able to successfully create 2D perovskite oxynitride nanosheets with a tunable bandgap using their novel process.\"Metal oxynitride semiconductor nanosheets containing oxygen, nitrogen, and a metal have not been researched much. Thin films made of these materials demonstrate functions superior to those of oxides. Thus, their synthesis will have a huge impact in this field. We synthesized nanosheets from RP-phase perovskite oxynitrides whose properties, such as its bandgap, are freely tunable,\" explains Prof. Ida, who is the corresponding author of the study.The researchers first used pristine Dion\u2013Jacobson phase lanthanum niobium oxide (KLaNb2O7) as a precursor material. They then proceeded to add nitrogen to this via a process called nitridation. The researchers added nitrogen at different temperatures ranging from 750 to 800\u2103 to the material. This led to the creation of the RP-phase oxynitride derivative. Following this, they were able to use a two-step intercalation process to exfoliate out lanthanum niobium oxynitride nanosheets with the formula LaNb2O7-xNx ('x' being the amount of nitrogen added to the perovskite).On testing these nanosheets, the researchers saw that the material had a homogenous thickness of 1.6 nm and exhibited different colors, ranging from white to yellow, depending on the nitridation temperature. The nanosheets also exhibited the desirable semiconductor property of having a tunable bandgap in the visible region, ranging from 2.03\u20132.63 eV, based on the nitridation temperature.The team then prepared a \"superlattice\" structure consisting of alternating layers of the synthesized nanosheets and oxide (Ca2Nb3O10) nanosheets. On testing the properties of this superlattice, they found that it exhibited superior proton conductivity and excellent photocatalytic activity.\"The results of this study will open new possibilities for producing multiple superlattices by employing soft\u2212chemical nano\u2212architectonics based on 2D nanosheets,\" says Prof. Ida. \"This will get us one step closer to a sustainable society, as these nanosheets would enable efficient splitting of water as a photocatalyst and also in creating more complex and better performing electronics.\" More information:Chu\u2010Wei Hsu et al, Bandgap Tunable Oxynitride LaNb 2 O 7\u2013x N x Nanosheets, Small (2023).

  "text": "Micron-sized \"bow ties,\" self-assembled from nanoparticles, form a variety of different curling shapes that can be precisely controlled, a research team led by the University of Michigan has shown.          The development opens the way for easily producing materials that interact with twisted light, providing new tools for machine vision and producing medicines.While biology is full of twisted structures like DNA, known as chiral structures, the degree of twist is locked in\u2014trying to change it breaks the structure. Now, researchers can engineer the degree of twist.Such materials could enable robots to accurately navigate complex human environments. Twisted structures would encode information in the shapes of the light waves that reflect from the surface, rather than in the 2D arrangement of symbols that comprises most human-read signs. This would take advantage of an aspect of light that humans can barely sense, known as polarization. The twisted nanostructures preferentially reflect certain kinds of circularly polarized light, a shape that twists as it moves through space.\"It is basically like polarization vision in crustaceans,\" said Nicholas Kotov, the Irving Langmuir Distinguished University Professor of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, who led the study. \"They pick up a lot of information in spite of murky environments.\"Robots could read signs that look like white dots to human eyes; the information would be encoded in the combination of frequencies reflected, the tightness of the twist and whether the twist was left- or right-handed.                Micron-scale bowties with candy-wrapper twists in a colorized electron microscope image. The ability to control the degree of twist in a curling, nanostructured material could be a useful new tool in chemistry and machine vision. Credit: Prashant Kumar, Kotov Lab, University of Michigan             By avoiding the use of natural and ambient light, relying instead on circularly polarized light generated by the robot, robots are less likely to miss or misinterpret a cue, whether in bright or dark environments. Materials that can selectively reflect twisted light, known as chiral metamaterials, are usually hard to make\u2014but the bow ties aren't.\"Previously, chiral metasurfaces have been made with great difficulty using multimillion dollar equipment. Now, these complex surfaces with multiple attractive uses can be printed like a photograph,\" Kotov said.Twisted nanostructures may also help create the right conditions to produce chiral medicines, which are challenging to manufacture with the correct molecular twist.      \"What hasn't been seen in any chiral systems before is that we can control the twist from a fully twisted left-handed structure to a flat pancake to a fully twisted right-handed structure. We call this a chirality continuum,\" said Prashant Kumar, a U-M postdoctoral research fellow in chemical engineering and first author of the study in Nature.Kumar tested the bow ties as a sort of paint, mixing them with polyacrylic acid and dabbing them onto glass, fabric, plastic and other materials. Experiments with lasers showed that this paint reflected twisted light only when the twist in the light matched the twist in the bow tie shape.The bow ties are made by mixing cadmium metal and cystine, a protein fragment that comes in left- and right-handed versions, in water spiked with lye. If the cystine was all left-handed, left-handed bow ties formed, and right-handed cystine yielded right-handed bow ties\u2014each with a candy-wrapper twist.                An array of different growth conditions, spanning from left-handed twists made with only left-handed cystine to flat pancakes made with a 50-50 mix to right-handed twists made only with right-handed cystine. The ability to control the degree of twist in a curling, nanostructured material could be a useful new tool in chemistry and machine vision. Credit: Prashant Kumar, Kotov Lab, University of Michigan             But with different ratios of left-and right-handed cystine, the team made intermediate twists, including the flat pancake at a 50-50 ratio. The pitch of the tightest bow ties, basically the length of a 360-degree turn, is about 4 microns long\u2014within infrared light's range of wavelengths.\"Not only do we know the progression from the atomic scale all the way up to the micron-scale of the bow ties, we also have theory and experiments that show us the guiding forces. With that fundamental understanding, you can design a bunch of other particles,\" said Thi Vo, a former U-M postdoctoral researcher in chemical engineering.He worked with Sharon Glotzer, co-corresponding author of the study and the Anthony C. Lembke Department Chair of Chemical Engineering at U-M.In contrast with other chiral nanostructures, which can take days to self-assemble, the bow ties formed in just 90 seconds. The team produced 5,000 different shapes within the bow tie spectrum. They studied the shapes in atomic detail using X-rays at Argonne National Laboratory ahead of the simulation analysis.The study is published in the journal Nature.

  "text": "COVID is not yet under control. Despite a bevy of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and antivirals, the virus continues to mutate and elude us. One solution that scientists have been exploring since the early days of the pandemic may come in the form of tiny antibodies derived from llamas, which target various parts of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.          In a new study in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, researchers describe a less expensive way to isolate and identify these so-called nanobodies. The findings will make it easier for scientists around the world to try their hand at discovering nanobodies that target SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses.\"Our method is more straightforward and less expensive than existing techniques,\" says Rockefeller's Michael P. Rout. \"You do need a llama, but that\u2014along with all the most complicated parts of the process\u2014can be outsourced.\"The authors have already used this optimized method to identify multiple nanobodies that appear to work against key variants of the virus, including omicron. \"COVID is clearly going to be a problem for some time,\" Rout says. \"We show that many of the nanobodies we have identified with this method target variants-of-concern, so they have real therapeutic potential.\"Nanobody noveltyNanobodies may work where larger antibodies fail, in part due to their compact size. Studies have shown that nanobodies can squeeze into parts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that larger antibodies cannot reach. Nanobodies also have unusually long shelf-lives, cost very little to mass-produce, and because of their unique physical properties, could theoretically be inhaled.Camelids such as llamas naturally produce nanobodies when exposed to a virus, and Rout and colleagues have developed enormous libraries of promising SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies by giving a small dose of COVID protein to llamas (which produce nanobodies in response, much like humans produce antibodies in response to a vaccine). After taking small blood samples from the llamas and sequencing the nanobody DNA, the scientists later transfer key genes to bacteria, which in turn, produce many more nanobodies for lab analysis.But screening these nanobody libraries to see how well they work (and which variants they work against) can be time-consuming and expensive. Rout and colleagues have long relied on the \"mass spectrometry\" technique, which works extraordinarily well but requires substantial expertise to perform and expensive equipment. They wondered whether a recently discovered \"yeast display method\", which was potentially far less expensive and simpler, could also effectively sort through their nanobody library.Rout, in collaboration with Rockefeller's Fred Cross, started by first optimizing the yeast display method. (The two heads-of-lab took the unusual step of performing most of the benchwork themselves). They then used their optimized method to screen a library of nanobodies that they had previously screened with the mass spectrometry technique. They found that their version of the yeast display method not only identified many of the same nanobody candidates as the other approach, but also identified numerous other candidates that they had missed.\"The method is not ours,\" Cross clarifies. \"But we made it simpler.\"Toward nanobody therapyThe relatively simple and low-cost procedure described in the paper could empower laboratories in low-resource areas to generate nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2, as well as other viruses. \"A researcher anywhere in the world, with fairly limited resources, could use this technique,\" Rout says. \"The llama-related stuff could be FedEx-ed from North America.\"For COVID, the long-term goal is that techniques such as these will lower the bar for entry into nanobody research and ultimately produce therapies that prevent infection. \"How we'd make the therapeutic is unestablished, as yet,\" Cross says. \"The specificity is there and the activity is there, but we don't have a drug yet. It'd be nice if we did. Hopefully someday.\"Because with COVID now transitioning to an endemic disease, novel methods for preventing the infection cannot come soon enough. \"New variants become prevalent by evading the immune system,\" Cross says. \"It's important to have a fast way to find new nanobodies targeting the variants.\" More information:Frederick R.

The findings could have a widespread impact on the development of composite scaffolds with hierarchical architectures potentially for the orderly spatial regeneration and remodeling of tissues in the future.One of the lead researchers, Professor Jiankang He, commented, \"The emergence of 3D printing technologies has enabled the rapid and customized fabrication of porous scaffolds with designer structural and mechanical properties, exhibiting great potential for various tissue repairing applications and future clinical usage.Nevertheless, one of the challenges of current 3D-printed scaffolds is the relatively large feature size, which limited the cell attachment and growth for the formation of dense cellular constructs for promoting tissue reconstruction. Given the widespread medical and scientific importance of 3D printing, it is truly important to enhance the capability of 3D-printed scaffolds to meet the pressing needs of facilitating tissue regeneration.One of the promising directions is to incorporate additional micro/nanoscale architectures inside the macroscale 3D-printed scaffolds as ECM alternatives for cellular colonization, organization, and maturation.\"Currently, few techniques can be utilized to introduce collagen-like micro/nanofibers within existing porous scaffolds due to the shielding effects of the existing architectures,\" First author Dr. Zijie Meng said.\"In our work, we show that ECM-mimetic fibrillar architectures could be incorporated into the 3D-printed scaffolds by freeze-casting the perfused short nanofiber suspensions into solid and then remove the ice via freeze-drying. Nanofibrillar architectures with aligned orientation can be obtained under the guidance of a unidirectional temperature gradient, which might be useful for promoting infiltration and migration of surrounding cells. By changing the freezing temperature, the median pore area of the nanofibrous architectures can be further controlled from c.a. 400 \u03bcm2 to 4000 \u03bcm2.\"      This novel combination allowed them to produce additional topological cues within mechanically-robust 3D-printed scaffolds. By seeding cells on the composite scaffolds with aligned nanofibrous architectures in vitro, researchers were able to understand the effect of the pore size of the aligned nanofibrillar architectures on cellular attachment, proliferation, and directed infiltration.The existence of nanofibrous architectures was found to significantly improve the cell seeding efficiency, proliferation rate, and directed cellular migration, as compared with pure 3D-printed scaffolds with large pore sizes and thick filaments.Co-first author Miss Xingdou Mu at the Air Force Medical University added, \"The composite scaffolds can provide volume-stable environments, enable directed cellular infiltration for tissue regeneration, and support the adipogenic maturation of ADSCs in vitro. Especially, the 3D-printed frameworks provided the majority of the mechanical support capacity of the composite scaffolds, while the cellular responses were found to be directly influenced by the embedded nanofibrous architectures.\"\"Additionally, when implanted into a subcutaneous model of rats, the composite scaffolds with aligned nanofibrous architectures can guide directed tissue infiltration and effectively promote nearby neovascularization, which might be helpful for the long-term survival of the regenerated tissues.\"The team studied a hybrid manufacturing strategy that is promising for composite scaffold production with hierarchical structures, and the experimental technology they have developed can be used for many different applications.Co-corresponding author Professor Juliang Zhang said, \"The host tissues were able to gradually infiltrate into the composite scaffolds along the direction of aligned nanofibrous structures, with the 3D-printed PCL frameworks contributing to the shape retention of the regenerated tissues. In the future, the feasibility to arrange cellular organization by changing the local orientation of nanofibrous micropores need further and deeper investigation, which might be potentially used for more complex and aligned tissue regeneration such as the tendon, ligament, nerve, and cardiac muscles.\" More information:Zijie Meng et al, Embedding aligned nanofibrous architectures within 3D-printed polycaprolactone scaffolds for directed cellular infiltration and tissue regeneration, International Journal of Extreme Manufacturing (2023).

  "text": "When it comes to studying particles in motion, experimentalists have followed a 100-year-old theory that claims the microscopic motion of a particle is determined by random collisions with molecules of the surrounding medium, regardless of the macroscopic forces that drive that motion.          Scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have found that this famous fluid dynamics relation, discovered by Walter Nernst and Albert Einstein in the beginning of the 20th century, breaks down completely under strong spatial confinement inside carbon nanotube pores. The research appears in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.In 1888, Nernst proposed a universal relation between the mobility of a charged particle and its diffusion coefficient. The microscopic origins of this relation were revealed in 1905 by Einstein, during his annus mirabilis period, culminating with his work on Brownian motion. The NE relation, as it is known, is an essential building block of several important theories of ion transport.Confined micro- and nano-environments, such as carbon nanotube porins, can test the NE relation, because confinement can restrict ion mobility, amplify proximity effects, enhance particle\u2013surface interactions and force unusual long-range structuring of liquids, all of which affect the particle motion.In the new work, the team tested the validity of the NE relation by investigating potassium (K) ion transport in 0.8-nm-diameter carbon nanotube porins (CNTPs). CNTPs are 10-nm-long segments of lipid-stabilized single-walled CNTs that are inserted into phospholipid membranes to form well-defined transmembrane pores with strong positive ion selectivity.\"The extreme spatial confinement in these pores hinders the diffusion of K+ ions greatly, reducing the diffusion coefficient by three orders of magnitude relative to its bulk value,\" said LLNL scientist Alex Noy, co-lead author of the paper. \"Surprisingly, the same confinement has a negligible effect on the electrophoretic mobility, leading to a complete breakdown of the NE relation.\"Molecular dynamics simulations using all-atomistic polarizable force fields revealed that in the absence of an electric field, the single-file water chain inside the CNTP hindered the diffusion of K+ ions through the CNTP. However, under an applied electric field, the single-file water chain breaks down and forms distinct ion-water clusters, which traverse the CNTs at much higher velocities.\"These two fundamentally different microscopic mechanisms are ultimately responsible for the breakdown of the NE relation in narrow CNTPs,\" said David Blankschtein, co-lead author from MIT.

  "text": "Each year, an estimated two trillion dollars is lost globally due to counterfeit products ranging from jewelry to medicine. As current security labels and product authentication methods are rapidly becoming obsolete or easy to hack, there is a rising urgency for more secure anti-counterfeiting labels.          A research team fabricated a 3D printed nano optical security label that provides 33100 possible combinations for heightened security in optical anti-counterfeiting. Associate Professor Joel Yang and team from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) collaborated with Professor Min Gu from University of Shanghai for Science and Technology (USST) and Associate Professor Cheng-Wei Qiu from National University of Singapore (NUS), along with their respective teams and published their research paper in Nature Nanotechnology.The research team achieved such a feat by exploiting higher dimensional structured light, i.e., colored Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) beams, through the fabrication of 3D printed spiral phase plates. Importantly, these plates were miniaturized down to a diameter smaller than that of a strand of human hair and further integrated with structural color filters\u2014spiky looking structures that allow specific colors of light through (refer to image).\"Orbital Angular Momentum or OAM light beam is increasingly being used in exciting research spaces such as optical communications, super-resolution imaging and quantum computing and we wanted to explore its capabilities in the anti-counterfeiting field as well. But OAM requires coherent light sources like lasers. We wanted to see if we could use incoherent light from the sun or a light bulb to generate OAM beams instead,\" explained Hongtao Wang, first author of the paper and SUTD-NUS joint Ph.D. student.The video shows the optical security label or photonic tally, consisting of colored vortex beam array. The photonic tally turns into colorful dots when overlapped with each other. During this process, the color and OAM (orbital angular momentum) information is decoded. Credit: Singapore University of Technology and DesignIn their study, they included color, spatial position, and OAM of light (one degree of freedom of light) onto a small colored vortex beam (CVB) generator (25 \u03bcm). With only 10-by-10 CVB unit array to demonstrate, the optical security label they designed could open pathways for the next generation of optical anti-counterfeiting.\"We see things clearly when we hold them up to the light. What our team has done is to learn how to use the natural light that surrounds us and extract tiny beams from it that carry information encoded in not just color, but also by how much we 'twist' its wavefront. This optical version of the combination lock that utilizes high-dimensional structured light provides us with a powerful platform for advanced anti-counterfeiting and information security,\" explained principal investigator Associate Professor Yang.

  "text": "Many futuristic novels and films have explored what the world might look like without water. But water scarcity isn't a problem for the far-off future: it's already here.          In its 2021 report UN Water outlined the scale of the crisis: 2.3 billion people live in water-stressed countries and 733 million of those people are in \"high and critically water-stressed countries\".In 2018 Cape Town, where I live and conduct my research, residents found themselves staring down \"day zero\", when household water supplies would run dry. Good rains spared the South African city, but now other parts of the country face similarly dire predictions of empty taps.This scenario is threatening to play out across Africa. In the Horn of Africa region, for example, large areas of Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya have seen four consecutive rainy seasons pass without decent rains. The rise of \"megacities\" in Africa\u2014with millions moving into city areas\u2014puts further pressures on already limited infrastructure.And the crisis extends far beyond the African continent.There is no one solution for this grim reality. A multi-pronged approach will be necessary, as Cape Town's experience illustrated.Technology will be a key part of solving the global water scarcity crisis. Technological solutions can run the gamut from the most basic, like water leak detectors for households, to highly sophisticated, like ways to pull moisture out of the air to produce clean drinking water, or convert the planet's abundant salt water into fresh water.In a recent paper colleagues and I outlined another potentially powerful technology: carbon nanomaterials, which have been shown to remove organic, inorganic and biological pollutants from water.      Contamination threatens water sourcesContamination is one of the factors putting strain on water sources. All water supplies contain some microbes and pathogens. But industrial waste is a huge problem: vehicles release heavy metal pollutants, for instance, and acid mine drainage seeps into water sources. This results in contaminated ground and surface water that cannot be safely used for most human activities, much less for drinking or washing food.Some current technologies make the treatment of water too expensive. Others are simply not up to the job and are unable to remove microorganisms. In removing organic pollutants like pharmaceutical waste, organic dyes, plastics and detergents from wastewater, for instance, some conventional techniques such as membrane filtration have been found wanting.That's where carbon nanomaterials come in. With others, I am exploring their use and finding that they are more efficient and economically viable than conventional materials.NanomaterialsNanomaterials are broadly defined as materials that contain particles of between 1 and 100 nanometers (nm) in size. One nanometre equals one-billionth of a meter. Different nanomaterials are composed of different atoms\u2014some, like those I research, are made up of carbon atoms.Carbon is, by mass, the second most abundant element in the human body after oxygen. It is also a common element of all known life. Carbon nanotechnologies are environmentally friendly because they hold less risk of secondary pollution than some adsorbents (solid substances used to remove contaminants from liquid or gas).Engineered into nanomaterial form, carbon nanomaterials are being hailed by many scientists around the world for their superior physical and chemical properties. They are increasingly prized for their potential to remove heavy metals from water thanks to their large surface area and adsorption capabilities, their nano-scaled size and their chemical properties.Carbon nanomaterials have all been shown to be effective in the treatment of wastewater.Tackling water scarcityI work with carbon-coated magnetic nanomaterials. This blended composite plays a crucial role in decontaminating water. At the same time, it removes materials such as heavy metals. That makes it ideal for water treatment, as do its easy, fast recovery and recyclability, thanks to what's known as magnetic filtration. In this process, the magnetic nanomaterials added to the contaminated water are recovered after treatment by an external strong magnet. The recovered materials can be regenerated and be reused again.Carbon-based nanomaterials still have shortcomings. Nanomaterials tend to clump together into large particles, reducing their capacity to adsorb (attract and hold) pollutants. And nanoparticles are not always fully recovered from treated water, leading to secondary contamination. We're still not sure how to separate exhausted\u2014fully utilized\u2014nanomaterials from treated water.The work continues in our lab and others all over the world. Scientists dislike timelines, since breakthroughs rarely happen within set deadlines. But our hope is that more and more advances will be made with carbon-based nanomaterials in the years to come, giving the world an important tool to tackle water scarcity.

  "text": "New results provide a platform for more efficient, selective, and sensitive DNA biosensors that can be used in detecting various pathogens and diseases.          Electrochemical DNA biosensors hold significant promise for monitoring of various diseases. Overall, their detection applications are vast, from target DNA analytes such as bacterial genes and tumor sequences to clinically relevant concentrations of SARS CoV-2 biomarkers, for example.However, to achieve appropriate sensitivity and selectivity of such systems and enable their translation from the laboratory to a clinical environment is challenging, as these approaches often involve complex chemistries, electrochemical labeling, technically challenging materials, or multistep processing.Now a team of researchers from Aalto University (Finland) and University of Strathclyde (Glasgow, UK) has found a way to significantly enhance the sensitivity of electrochemical DNA sensors by using modular DNA nanostructures as their novel components. The researchers combined the conventional DNA-based sensor techniques with programmable DNA origami structures to create a label-free sensor with significantly increased selectivity and sensitivity of detection.\"In practice, our starting point is a rather simple and common DNA biosensor type\u2014we have an electrode system immersed into the analyte solution, where the sensing electrode is coated with single-stranded DNA probe strands that are complementary to the (single-stranded) target DNA sequences. Once the target strand binds and hybridizes with the probe strand, the electric charges near the electrode move a bit, meaning that we can see a change in the electrochemical signal,\" explains doctoral student Petteri Piskunen from Aalto University, one ofthe authors of the research.\"Here DNA origami nanostructures come into play. We equipped our tile-like DNA origami with target-capturing strands that can efficiently and selectively bind to one end of the target sequence, while the other end of the target binds to the probe strands. Therefore, we are creating a sandwich-like complex, where the target strand is trapped between the electrode and the DNA origami. Then, instead of recording a small signal change upon the target binding, we will see an amplified effect due to the presence of the comparatively large DNA origami,\" continues Piskunen.\"We demonstrated the feasibility of our system by detecting a gene fragment from bacteria with an antibiotic resistance. We could selectively trap this target from a rather complex solution that contained various types of single-stranded DNA, from short strands and junk fragments to long circular DNA. With our sensor we could reliably detect 100\u20131000 times lower target concentrations than with the conventional techniques,\" says Visiting Scientist Veikko Linko (currently Associate Professor at University of Tartu, Estonia).\"It is encouraging to think that by combining versatile DNA origami with for example printable and disposable electrodes, we could create label-free sensing platforms with such high sensitivity and specificity. This positions our technology with a route to mass manufacturability and broad applicability as point-of-care devices. At the moment, collaborative work with the University of Strathclyde is ongoing for generalizing the sensor setup for use with different kinds of biomarkers,\" Linko concludes.The findings are published in the journal ACS Sensors.

  "text": "A team of researchers led by Prof. Andre Geim from the National Graphene Institute (NGI) have discovered that nanoripples in graphene can make it a strong catalyst, contrary to general expectations that the carbon sheet is as chemically inert as the bulk graphite from which it is obtained.          Published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the research has shown that graphene with nanoscale corrugations of its surface can accelerate hydrogen splitting as well as the best metallic-based catalysts. This unexpected effect is likely to be present in all two-dimensional materials, which are all inherently non-flat.The Manchester team in collaboration with researchers from China and U.S. conducted a series of experiments to show that non-flatness of graphene makes it a strong catalyst. First, using ultrasensitive gas flow measurements and Raman spectroscopy, they demonstrated that graphene's nanoscale corrugations were linked to its chemical reactivity with molecular hydrogen (H2) and that the activation energy for its dissociation into atomic hydrogen (H) was relatively small.The team evaluated whether this reactivity is enough to make the material an efficient catalyst. To this end, the researchers used a mixture of hydrogen and deuterium (D2) gases and found that graphene indeed behaved as a powerful catalyst, converting H2 and D2 into HD. This was in stark contrast to the behavior of graphite and other carbon-based materials under the same conditions. The gas analyses revealed that the amount of HD generated by monolayer graphene was approximately the same as for the known hydrogen catalysts, such as zirconia, magnesium oxide and copper, but graphene was required only in tiny quantities, less than 100 times of the latter catalysts.\"Our paper shows that freestanding graphene is quite different from both graphite and atomically flat graphene that are chemically extremely inert. We have also proved that nanoscale corrugations are more important for catalysis than the 'usual suspects' such as vacancies, edges and other defects on graphene's surface,\" said Dr. Pengzhan Sun, first author of the paper.Lead author of the paper Prof. Geim added, \"As nanorippling naturally occurs in all atomically thin crystals, because of thermal fluctuations and unavoidable local mechanical strain, other 2D materials may also show similarly enhanced reactivity. As for graphene, we can certainly expect it to be catalytically and chemically active in other reactions, not only those involving hydrogen.\"\"2D materials are most often perceived as atomically flat sheets, and effects caused by unavoidable nanoscale corrugations have so far been overlooked. Our work shows that those effects can be dramatic, which has important implications for the use of 2D materials. For example, bulk molybdenum sulfide and other chalcogenides are often employed as 3D catalysts. Now we should wonder if they could be even more active in their 2D form.\" More information:P. Z.

  "text": "Researchers at Kanazawa University report in ACS Nano how high-speed atomic force microscopy can be used to study the biomolecular mechanisms underlying gene editing.          The DNA of prokaryotes\u2014single-cell organisms, for example bacteria\u2014is known to contain sequences that are derived from DNA fragments of viruses that infected the prokaryote earlier. These sequences, collectively referred to as CRISPR, for \"clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats,\" play a major role in the antiviral defense system of bacteria, as they enable the recognition and subsequent neutralization of infecting viruses. The latter is done through the enzyme Cas9 (\"CRISPR-associated protein 9\"), a biomolecule that can locally unwind DNA, check for the existence of the CRISPR sequence and, when found, cut the DNA.In recent years, CRISPR/Cas9 has emerged as a genome editing tool based on the notion that the Cas9 protein can be activated with artificially created CRISPR-like sequences. Sometimes, however, the wrong target is \"caught\" by Cas9\u2014when the wrongly identified DNA sequence is too similar to the intended target sequence. It is therefore of crucial importance to fully understand how Cas9 binds to, \"interrogates,\" and cuts DNA. Mikihiro Shibata from Kanazawa University and colleagues have now succeeded in video-recording the DNA binding and cleaving dynamics of Staphylococcus aureus (a particular bacterium) Cas9 by means of high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). Their observations will help to reach a more complete understanding of CRISPR-Cas9 mechanisms.Three representative HS-AFM movies of apo-SaCas9 molecules on the AP-mica surface, showing that apo-SaCas9 adopts flexible conformations. Credit: ACS Nano (2023). DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.2c10709In recent years, HS-AFM has emerged as a powerful nanoimaging tool for studying molecular structures and their dynamics at high spatiotemporal resolution. For such molecular dynamics to be observable, samples need to be put on a carefully chosen substrate. For their study of Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9), Shibata and colleagues chemically modified a mica surface. This way, observed molecules \"stick\" to the substrate, but not too strongly, so that molecular mobilities are still high enough for the relevant biomolecular interactions to happen\u2014slowed-down, within intervals of time accessible to HS-AFM.The artificial activation of Cas9 happens via the association with a so-called single-guide RNA (sgRNA) molecule, which provides the information about the targeted DNA sequence. The scientists first observed that the SaCas9-sgRNA complex adopts a flexible modular structure that can switch from an open to a closed configuration, which enables eventual binding to the DNA. They also managed to image the cutting of DNA at the targeted site.The researchers looked in more detail at the mechanism of detection of targeted DNA by SaCas9-sgRNA, and found evidence that it involves a selective, long-range interaction. Although the precise nature of this interaction remains unclear, Shibata and colleagues believe that hydrophobic forces between parts of the SaCas9-sgRNA complex and the DNA play a key role.The potential importance of such long-range interactions in CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing is unexpected\u2014up to know, the common belief has been that target DNA is identified through diffusion processes. Additional studies are needed to further explore this aspect. The scientists state, \"Although the present HS-AFM observations represent direct evidence of the long-range selective interaction between SaCas9-sgRNA and its target DNA, further investigations are necessary to confirm the mechanism of search for target DNA hypothesized and illustrated in the present study.\"      High-speed atomic force microscopyThe general principle of atomic force microscopy (AFM) is to make a very small tip scan the surface of a sample. During this horizontal (xy) scan, the tip, which is attached to a small cantilever, follows the sample's vertical (z) profile, inducing a force on the cantilever that can be measured. The magnitude of the force at the xy position can be related to the z value; the xyz data generated during a scan then result in a height map providing structural information about the investigated sample.In high-speed-AFM (HS-AFM), the working principle is slightly more involved: the cantilever is made to oscillate near its resonance frequency. When the tip is moved around a surface, the variations in the amplitude (or the frequency) of the cantilever's oscillation\u2014resulting from the tip's interaction with the sample's surface\u2014are recorded, as these provide a measure for the local \"z\" value. AFM does not involve lenses, so its resolution is not restricted by the so-called diffraction limit as in X-ray diffraction, for example.HS-AFM results in a video, where the time interval between frames depends on the speed with which a single image can be generated (by xy-scanning the sample). Researchers at Kanazawa University have in recent years developed HS-AFM further, so that it can be applied to study biochemical molecules and biomolecular processes in real-time. Mikihiro Shibata and colleagues have now applied the method to study the molecular dynamics of a Cas9\u2013DNA interaction process, which is highly relevant for on-going research on the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing tool.

  "text": "In recent years, the device efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs) has been significantly improved, but the unsatisfactory stability restricts future commercialization processing.          Inverted device structure has been widely adopted to enhance the device stability of OSCs. However, zinc oxide (ZnO), the most commonly used electron-transporting material, is photocatalytic active, which could accelerate the decomposition of the active layers under continuous light illumination, and then lead to the degradation of device performance. Therefore, developing new electron-transporting materials is extremely critical for utilizing efficient and stable OSCs.Recently, Prof. Zhou Huiqiong's group from National Center for Nanoscience and Technology (NCNST) of the Chinese Academy of Science (CAS) has developed a new electron transport material Ir/IrOx to enhance the stability of OSCs. The study was published online in Nature Communications.Prof. Zhou's group has carried out a series of studies focused on the stability of OSCs. By incorporating organic electron transport material PFN-Br into the ZnO layer, the surface energy of the interface layer was regulated, resulting in the enhanced device stability (Journal of Materials Chemistry A ). Furthermore, the polyaspartic acid (PASP) film was deposited on the ZnO film to suppress the degradation caused by illumination, leading to the improved stability of organic solar cells. (Journal of Materials Chemistry C).In this study, the Ir/IrOx nanoparticles prepared by the mild colloid solution method were utilized as the electron-transporting material in organic solar cells instead of the common ZnO layer.Benefiting from the suitable work function, heterogeneous surface energy distribution in nanoscale and optimized optical field, the Ir/IrOx-based devices exhibited more efficient charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination compared with the ZnO-based devices, leading to improved device performance.Due to the absence of photocatalysis, the active layer deposited on Ir/IrOx film exhibited more stable component distribution and morphology, elongating the lifetime of Ir/IrOx-based devices under storage in inert atmosphere, thermal aging and maximum-power-point (MPP) tracking conditions. In particular, the T70 lifetime of Ir/IrOx-based devices under thermal aging exceeded 10,000 hours.Moreover, the better stability of Ir/IrOx-based devices under UV irradiation and thermal cycling between -40\u2103 and 85\u2103 illustrated the huge potential of OSCs with Ir/IrOx operating under extreme environments.\"The appropriate optoelectric properties and photocatalytic inactivity of Ir/IrOx allow us to investigate the mechanism of photo-induced degradation in OSCs, finally achieving the enhanced device stability under various aging condition,\" said Prof. Zhou. \"We envision that our results are also helpful to the related work focused on the intrinsic stability of OSCs.\" More information:Yanxun Li et al, Lifetime over 10000 hours for organic solar cells with Ir/IrOx electron-transporting layer, Nature Communications (2023).

  "text": "More efficient and longer lasting glucose-responsive insulin that eliminates the need for people with type 1 diabetes to measure their glucose levels could be a step closer thanks to a Monash University-led project.          Published in the journal Advanced Materials, the preclinical study engineered a superior artificial pancreas system to release insulin precisely and smartly only when the body actually needs it, making control of blood glucose more reliable.The researchers from Monash University, RMIT University, The University of Melbourne and the Baker Institute developed the system to respond to glucose, which current insulin does not.Co-first author Dr. Rong Xu, from the Monash University Central Clinical School's Australian Center for Blood Diseases, and Dr. Sukhvir Kaur Bhangu from RMIT University and the University of Melbourne said if it worked in humans, only two injections would be needed per day.Current insulin therapy requires people to monitor their blood sugar throughout the day and take multiple, carefully calculated doses based on food intake, exercise, stress, illness and other factors.Some must inject themselves up to five times a day. Continuous glucose monitoring devices remove, or at least reduce, the need for finger pricks, and insulin pumps can automatically deliver insulin, but they are very expensive and still are not always able to calculate the correct amount of insulin to be given.The multidisciplinary team developed a new \"artificial pancreas system\" using phytoglycogen nanoparticles, which are chains on glucose molecules dubbed a \"nanosugar platform\" as they are made of glucose, to deliver and release insulin in response to glucose levels in the blood.This engineered nanosugar platform enabled rapid and sustained glucose-responsive insulin delivery, which was longer lasting and smarter than other systems.Dr. Xu said it required only one injection every 12 hours and self-regulated. \"This system would mean fewer injections and, potentially, no need to measure glucose,\" Dr. Xu said.The research emerged from an NHMRC Ideas Grant awarded to co-lead author and Head of Monash University's Australian Center for Blood Diseases NanoBiotechnology Laboratory, Professor Christoph Hagemeyer, co-lead author and RMIT Associate Professor Francesca Cavalieri, and co-author Professor Frank Caruso at the University of Melbourne to develop this revolutionary type of insulin.Professor Hagemeyer said more research was needed but the results were promising. He said the nanosugar platform was biodegradable, which enabled rapid and extended glucose control in two different models of type 1 diabetes with a single injection.\"The nanosugar particles are engineered to control insulin release and absorption through the lymphatic system into the blood,\" he said.Professor Cavalieri said the research team, which includes several clinicians, now hoped to secure funding to continue the project and eventually undertake clinical trials. \"This new method is not only efficient, it's biodegradable and uses natural methods, which significantly reduces the chances of adverse affects or immune reactions,\" she said.

  "answer_squad": " making piezoelectricity a reality for anyone hoping to charge their devices more sustainably and without reliance on a traditional power source",
  "text": "A 'best practice' protocol for researchers developing piezoelectric materials has been developed by scientists\u2014a first in this cutting-edge field of technology.          The protocol was developed by an international team led by physicists at University of Bath in the UK, in response to findings that experimental reports lack consistency. The researchers made the shocking discovery that 9 out of 10 scientific papers miss experimental information that is crucial to ensure the reproducibility of the reported work. They discuss the urgent need for a standardized piezoelectricity research protocol in the journal Nano Energy.Dr. Morteza Hassanpour Amiri at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research, Germany and first author of the study, said, \"Research into piezoelectricity has accelerated in recent years, and for good reason: piezoelectric materials generate electricity when you exert pressure or mechanical vibrations, or when you tap on or distort them. Add a circuit and this electricity can be stored and then used.\"High energy-harvesting efficiencyBecause of the huge potential of the piezoelectrics, over the past 20 years a steady stream of new materials and composites have been developed and tested for their energy harvesting potential, with many claiming high efficiencies.But the researchers, led by Professor Kamal Asadi from the Department of Physics, suggest these findings\u2014sometimes published in high-caliber journals\u2014often do not include details of key experimental parameters. These details are essential to ensure reproducibility when other research teams set out to independently evaluate or further improve the featured materials.Explaining, Professor Asadi said, \"Reproducibility of experimental research findings may not be the key to the success of a research, but it is the key to ruling out unreliable findings from being accepted as fact. The enthusiasm to develop a champion material that shows impressive performance should be accompanied with enough supporting data.\"For the study, the Bath researchers assessed 80 randomly selected research papers published over the past two decades on piezoelectric energy harvesting devices. For nearly 90% of these papers, essential experimental parameters\u2014needed to evaluate materials and devices\u2014were missing, thus rendering the experiments hard, and sometimes impossible, to reproduce.      The importance of reproducibilityExpanding, Professor Asadi said, \"There are three important reasons why reproducibility is important: We are scientists and should strive to be as accurate as possible; we have limited resources, so by reporting all the necessary parameters that guarantee reproducibility, we are helping our peers to build up on our findings and advance the field; by being transparent, we also build trust with the public, and with science funding organizations and policymakers, and provide a better guidance for future 'big' decisions that can affect us all.\"Professor Asadi, who is a leading expert in piezoelectricity, says this lack of data is hampering progress in the field, as researchers can't turn to the literature to identify materials with the best harvesting potential, and then further develop these promising materials.New protocolThe new Bath protocol suggests a standardized data collection and reporting. Professor Chris Bowen from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Bath, who was also involved in this study, said, \"We have basically created guidelines that would be helpful to researchers in their field of piezoelectricity.\"Professor Asadi is hopeful that electronic devices powered by piezoelectricity will be on the market within the next 10 years.\"That's why it's important to have a standardized protocol for reporting research data for a quantitative evaluation of energy harvesting materials and devices. Doing so enables scientists to make real progress building on each other's experiments and working towards a common goal: making piezoelectricity a reality for anyone hoping to charge their devices more sustainably and without reliance on a traditional power source.\"He added, \"The field of piezoelectric energy harvesting is a really exciting field, it has lots of potential and great scientists are working on it, but it's still fledgling, and so to make sure we advance as well and as quickly as possible, ensuring experiments are reproducible is going to be crucial, so I hope our suggested protocol is adopted by the community at large.\" More information:Morteza Hassanpour Amiri et al, Piezoelectric energy harvesters: A critical assessment and a standardized reporting of power-producing vibrational harvesters, Nano Energy (2022).

  "answer_race": " To introduce a new class of materials.",
  "question_squad": " What is the structure of MXenes?",
  "answer_squad": " puff pastry",
  "text": "MXenes are able to store large amounts of electrical energy like batteries and to charge and discharge rather quickly like a supercapacitor. They are thus a very interesting class of materials for energy storage. The material is structured like a kind of pastry, with the MXene layers separated by thin water films. A team at HZB has now investigated how protons migrate in the water films confined between the layers of the material and enable charge transport. Their results have been published in the journal Nature Communications and may accelerate the optimization of these kinds of energy storage materials.          One of the biggest challenges for a climate-neutral energy supply is the storage of electrical energy. Conventional batteries can hold large amounts of energy, but the charging and discharging processes take time. Supercapacitors, on the other hand, charge very quickly but are limited in the amount of stored energy. Only in the last few years has a new class of materials been discussed that combines the advantages of batteries with those of supercapacitors, named pseudocapacitors.Promising materials: PseudocapacitorsAmong pseudocapacitive materials, so-called MXenes consisting of a large family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides appear particularly promising. Their structure resembles a puff pastry, with the individual layers separated by a thin film of water that enables the transport of charges.Titanium carbide MXenes, especially, are conductive and their layered structure combined with highly negatively-charged hydrophilic surfaces offers a unique material in which positively charged ions such as protons can diffuse very efficiently. The MXenes used in this study were synthesized in the group of Prof. Yury Gogotsi in Drexel University.Over the last years, this property has been used to store and release energy from protons at unprecedented rates in acidic environment. It remains though unclear if the charges are mostly stored based on proton adsorption at the MXene surface or through desolation of proton in the MXene interlayer.Due to its two-dimensional geometry, the 2-3 layer thick water film trapped between the MXene layers is expected to solvate protons differently from bulk water that we classically know. While this confinement effect is supposed to play a role in the fast diffusion of protons inside MXene materials, it has been impossible until now to characterize protons inside a MXene electrode during charging and discharging.Vibrational modes analyzedThe team led by Dr. Tristan Petit at HZB has now succeeded in doing this for the first time by analyzing vibrational modes of protons excited by infrared light. Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Mailis Lounasvuori has developed an operando electrochemical cell that she used to analyze protons and water inside titanium carbide MXenes at BESSY II during the charging and discharging processes. In the process, she also succeeded in distilling out the special signature of the protons in the confined water between the MXene layers.\"These vibrational patterns are very different from those we would observe for protons in a three-dimensional water environment,\" says Mailis Lounasvuori.\"The fact that water molecules absorb infrared radiation particularly strongly while MXene emits very low amount of light in this energy range made IR spectroscopy ideally suited to our question,\" Petit explains.Fast diffusion explainedThis unusual hydration structure, showing that protons are solvated by fewer water molecules under confinement than in bulk water, suggest that proton de-solvation upon intercalation between MXene layers may contribute to pseudocapacitive energy storage in acidic environment.It may also explain why protons diffuse particularly fast within MXene materials, which is related to their fast dis/charging time. Beyond energy storage applications, this work shows that MXenes are an ideal platform to investigate fundamental properties of confined chemical species, which certainly have other new chemical properties that remains to be discovered.This technique will be further applied to other types of cations beyond protons (such as the Li+ ion) diffusing inside MXene materials to unravel new pseudocapacitive energy storage mechanisms.

  "text": "Lancaster University researchers have pioneered a technique to observe the 3D internal structure of rechargeable batteries for the first time.          The research, published in Nature Communications, is led by Professor Oleg Kolosov from Lancaster's Physics Department in collaboration with University College London and NEXGENNA Faraday Institution Consortium.The team used a novel 3D Nano-Rheology Microscopy (3DNRM) -based technique to visualize the 3D nanostructure inside rechargeable batteries, from the molecular scale electrical double-layer to the nanoscale-thick electrochemical surface layer on the graphite anode surface in a lithium-ion battery.For the first time, this enabled the direct observation of the progression of the whole three dimensional structure of the solid electric interface (SEI), a nanoscale passivation layer formed on the battery electrode-electrolyte interface, that predetermines key battery properties.The authors were able to reveal key predictors of SEI layer formation in a complex interplay of molecular dimension electrical double layer structures, surface properties of carbon layers and solvent\u2014Li ions interaction in the electrolyte.The nanoarchitecture of solid-liquid interfaces are critical for high performance batteries, but it has been difficult to characterize reaction interfaces within batteries due to their inherent inaccessibility.Dr. Yue Chen of Lancaster University, who is the lead author, said, \"So far, understanding the SEI formation mechanism is still a most challenging and least explored area due to the lack of an interfacial characterization technique capable of both nanoscale resolution and operation in the working battery environment.\"The dynamics of interfacial reactions define energy flow and conversion and govern chemical species transfer in important physical, chemical and biological processes, from catalytic reactions, energy storage and release in batteries, to antigen-antibody interactions and information transmission across neural cells.This opens up a wide range of areas for the new technique from energy storage and chemical engineering to biomedical applications.

  "text": "Nanotechnology has significantly impacted the semiconductor industry, enabling the production of transistors that are just a few nanometers in size. While the miniaturization of electronic components has resulted in higher transistor densities, it has also increased heat generation.          To address this, current thermal technology relies on thermoelectric cooling modules, liquid coolants and heat sinks to dissipate heat. However, we envision a future when nanotechnology plays a crucial role in developing miniature cooling and energy-harvesting devices that can be seamlessly integrated with electronic circuits. Our research is motivated by this vision, and we are working to advance the field by exploring novel nanomaterials and device architectures for efficient heat management and energy harvesting.How can we control heat generation in a novel way?The manipulation of quantum resources in the electronics industry holds great potential for building innovative devices aimed at controlling heat generation. Advancements in this field rely heavily on theoretical foundations and basic design principles involving the theory of open quantum systems. By developing a better understanding of these concepts, researchers can create faster and more efficient cooling strategies for cutting-edge electronics.However, extensive research is needed to fully establish the theory of energy transfer in thermal devices, especially when these systems are strongly coupled to their surrounding environment. Before thermal device models can be brought to the fabrication stage, it's crucial to explore the area of quantum thermal management in-depth.One such example of an open quantum system is the thermal transistor, which interacts with a collection of thermal baths. Two-level systems represent the terminals of the transistor. In a quantum thermal transistor, three such systems interact with three thermal baths with different temperatures directly coupled. Once configured, the thermal transistor behaves similarly to an electronic transistor. By connecting multiple thermal transistors through baths, researchers can create a multi-transistor system with the potential to generate various thermal counterparts of electronics.Novel perspective for future electronic industryAs detailed by research published in Physical Review B, we have developed a novel theoretical model for thermal energy control using a multi-transistor structure, which enables the guidance of heat flow like electricity. Unlike previous studies that utilized single structures, we used rings of two-level systems connected to various baths to achieve our model, which enhanced the ability to amplify heat currents.Our model is efficient as it can be placed on a substrate, opening the way to a practical quantum thermal transistor design. We investigated how common environmental effects and reservoir engineering techniques can be utilized to generate dark-states, leading to the realization of thermal logic gates.Although our research is still focused on the experimental realization of these models, they have the potential to revolutionize how we approach efficient thermal management in modern electronics. The on/off action of these thermal transistors could be used to cool electronic circuits, presenting a novel implication for future electronics.This story is part of Science X Dialog, where researchers can report findings from their published research articles.

  "text": "Selenium is a micronutrient that plays an essential role in human health but is toxic at high levels. However, new biomedical research has shown selenium actually has anti-cancer properties when used at high doses.          To overcome problems with its inherent toxicity, an international research team, led by Professor Steve Conlan in Swansea University and Professor Laurent Charlet at Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, tested whether selenium nanoparticles could be developed as a potential cancer treatment. Their findings have just been published in the journal Redox Biology.The researchers demonstrated that the selenium nanoparticles were very effective at killing ovarian cancer cell models grown in 3D to replicate the native tumor environment.They went on to discover a novel biological mechanism underpinning how selenium is likely to cause this anti-cancer effect. They found that selenium causes changes in the activity of enzymes called histone methylatransferases. These enzymes regulate epigenetic processes\u2014how environmental conditions can alter the way genes work. Unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic changes do not change the sequence of DNA and are reversible, but they do change how your body reads a DNA sequence.This research was carried out by Dr. Benoit Toubans, as part of his joint Ph.D. project supported by the Swansea-Grenoble strategic partnership, and Dr. Noor Al Kafri, a CARA fellow in Professor Conlan's laboratory, together with collaborators at the synchrotron facility in Grenoble and the University of Stuttgart.Professor Conlan, who heads the Reproductive Biology and Gynecological Oncology group at Swansea University Medical School, described the project as a tremendous scientific research effort. \"This is one of those quite rare moments when you realize the team have made a novel biological discovery.

  "answer_squad": " Ruben F. and Donna Mettler",
  "text": "In the latest advance in nano- and micro-architected materials, engineers at Caltech have developed a new material made from numerous interconnected microscale knots.          The knots make the material far tougher than identically structured but unknotted materials: they absorb more energy and are able to deform more while still being able to return to their original shape undamaged. These new knotted materials may find applications in biomedicine as well as in aerospace applications due to their durability, possible biocompatibility, and extreme deformability.\"The capability to overcome the general trade-off between material deformability and tensile toughness [the ability to be stretched without breaking] offers new ways to design devices that are extremely flexible, durable, and can operate in extreme conditions,\" says former Caltech graduate student Widianto P. Moestopo, now at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Moestopo is the lead author of a paper on the nanoscale knots that was published on March 8 in Science Advances.Moestopo helped develop the material in the lab of Julia R. Greer, the Ruben F. and Donna Mettler Professor of Materials Science, Mechanics and Medical Engineering; Fletcher Jones Foundation director of the Kavli Nanoscience Institute; and senior author of the paper. Greer is at the forefront of the creation of such nano-architected materials, or materials whose structure is designed and organized at a nanometer scale and that consequently exhibit unusual, often surprising properties.The tensile strength of a material constructed with microscale knots (left), compared to that of a material that lacks knots but is otherwise structurally identical (right). Credit: Caltech\"Embarking on understanding how the knots would affect the mechanical response of micro-architected materials was a new out-of-the-box idea,\" Greer says. \"We had done extensive research on studying the mechanical deformation of many other types of micro-textiles, for example, lattices and woven materials. Venturing into the world of knots allowed us to gain deeper insights into the role of friction and energy dissipation, and proved to be meaningful.\"Each knot is around 70 micrometers in height and width, and each fiber has a radius of around 1.7 micrometers (around one-hundredth the radius of a human hair). While these are not the smallest knots ever made\u2014in 2017 chemists tied a knot made from an individual strand of atoms\u2014this does represent the first time that a material composed of numerous knots at this scale has ever been created. Further, it demonstrates the potential value of including these nanoscale knots in a material\u2014for example, for suturing or tethering in biomedicine.      The knotted materials, which were created out of polymers, exhibit a tensile toughness that far surpasses materials that are unknotted but otherwise structurally identical, including ones where individual strands are interwoven instead of knotted. When compared to their unknotted counterparts, the knotted materials absorb 92 percent more energy and require more than twice the amount of strain to snap when pulled.The knots were not tied but rather manufactured in a knotted state by using advanced high-resolution 3D lithography capable of producing structures in the nanoscale. The samples detailed in the Science Advancespaper contain simple knots\u2014an overhand knot with an extra twist that provides additional friction to absorb additional energy while the material is stretched. In the future, the team plans to explore materials constructed from more complex knots.Moestopo's interest in knots grew out of research he was conducting in 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdowns. \"I came across some works from researchers who are studying the mechanics of physical knots as opposed to knots in a purely mathematical sense. I do not consider myself a climber, a sailor, or a mathematician, but I have tied knots throughout my life, so I thought it was worth trying to insert knots into my designs,\" he says.The paper has a tongue-in-cheek title\u2014\"Knots are Not for Naught: Design, Properties, and Topology of Hierarchical Intertwined Microarchitected Materials.\"Naval Research.

  "question_squad": " What is the most common chronic liver disease in the world?",
  "answer_squad": " Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease",
  "text": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common chronic liver disease in the world. In its advanced form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is curable when diagnosed and treated in its early stages. However, when left untreated, it could progress to the irreversible stage of liver cirrhosis and cancer, making early diagnosis imperative.          However, to date, the only approach to definitively diagnose NASH is through a liver biopsy, which is often painful and invasive to patients. This renders an urgent need to develop better diagnostic approaches for NASH.To tackle this issue, Assistant Professor Wang Jiong-Wei from the Department of Surgery and Nanomedicine Translational Research Program at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS Medicine), in collaboration with Professor Liu Bin from Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the College of Design and Engineering, National University of Singapore, led a team to develop an enzyme-sensitive nanoprobe to improve the accuracy and sensitivity of diagnosing NASH using an MRI technique.This study is published in ACS Nano.This device is used in the detection of NASH by targeting specific biomarkers in the liver\u2013oxidative enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO), which are biological molecules in the body that signal disease. In the liver of a NASH patient, high amounts of MPO are present. MPO is a key peroxidase released from the innate immune system to catalyze the formation of reactive oxidative species at the inflamed site of tissue.The nanoprobe contains an enzyme substrate that would bind to the MPO in the liver, present in high amounts due to NASH. It will then emit a signal that can be readily detected by MR imaging techniques, providing more sensitive MRI data for the diagnosis of NASH.Researchers are currently conducting follow-up studies to validate the effectiveness of the nanoprobe. This diagnostic tool can be combined with new drugs to monitor the treatment responses of NASH patients.\"This discovery emphasizes the importance of nanomedicine as a platform with two pillars\u2014diagnosis and therapy. It is only with detailed and accurate diagnosis that effective treatment can follow,\" said Professor Wang, co-lead author of the study.

  "text": "They kill with a molecular sting or oxidative shock and don't know the meaning of fatigue. The latest biocidal nanocomposites, designed and synthesized by scientists at the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IPJ PAN) in Krakow, are charting new directions for materials engineering in the fight against microorganisms.          The increasing number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is posing challenges not only to physicians, but also to physicists involved in materials engineering. In mankind's generations-long Sisyphean struggle against the world of dangerous microorganisms, it seems that we have finally gained allies ready to meet the challenge: composite materials capable of spontaneously and continuously killing microorganisms and preventing their colonies from growing.The biocidal nanocomposites, designed, synthesized and characterized at the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IFJ PAN) in Krakow, Poland, are discussed in a series of recently published scientific articles.\"In the work of our team, we try to apply the idea of 'reverse physics': we start not with the substance we want to study to find applications for it, but with the applications themselves. Once we have established our needs, we design the future material precisely with these needs in mind, carry out numerical simulations, and then try to synthesize it. Only when we manage this successfully, do we proceed to check whether the properties of the obtained material are in line with our expectations,\" explains Dr. Lukasz Laskowski (IFJ PAN), leader of a team which included Dr. Agnieszka Karczmarska, Dr. Magdalena Laskowska and Dr. Mateusz Schabikowski.The need to develop a new, durable and safe biocidal material was signaled by researchers from the Institute of Physiology and Animal Nutrition of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IFiZZ PAN) in Jablonna. They pointed out that if the face masks known to everyone from the time of the pandemic are changed infrequently, they accumulate microorganisms and, as their habitat, can be a source of secondary infection.What would therefore be needed is a material that not only acts as a filter, but is also capable of continuously eliminating the microorganisms that settle on it. The physicists at the IFJ PAN thought that a composite material constructed from a neutral matrix with appropriately attached functional groups capable of effectively killing microorganisms could be a way to solve the problem.      The permanent attachment of biocidal molecules and appropriate selection of their properties would guarantee that the material would retain its characteristics for practically any period of time.In the case of biocidal composites with silver ions, developed by scientists from the IFJ PAN, either aluminum oxide or silicon dioxide (i.e. silica) matrices can be used, depending on the need. In the former case, the matrices are in the form of a sieve with pore diameters of about 40 nanometers, while in the latter, they are spheres with diameters ranging from 50 to 500 nm.The porous matrix makes it possible to filter, for example, air or body fluids, while the spherical silica makes it possible to incorporate the biocidal material into other substances, such as dental fillings.\"Naturally, the main role in our materials is not played by the matrix, but by the functional groups deposited on it in an appropriate manner. The key biocidal agent, in this case the silver ion, is captured by a carboxyl group attached to a propyl chain. This structure is pliant and acts superbly as a sting or knife, which, on contact with the bacterium, destroys its cell membrane,\" explains Dr. Laskowski.The biocidal molecules in the new composites are bound to the matrix chemically and therefore permanently. This fact means, first and foremost, that these molecules will be able to perform their task continuously and exactly where they are placed. Over time, therefore, they will not lose their capabilities, they will not be washed out of a dental filling into the body, nor will they be released from a used mask into the environment.The second class of new nanocomposites from the IFJ PAN uses a different tool to fight bacteria: propyl-phosphate groups containing a copper ion. They capture oxygen molecules from the air, which are then reduced by the copper ion, acting as a single-electron catalyst. The reactions taking place involve hydrogen from the water molecules common in our environment. As a result, hydrogen peroxide is continually formed around the copper functional groups. On contact with it, most microorganisms are killed by oxidative shock.\"As with silver nanocomposites, the copper is also permanently bonded to the matrix and does not wear out. Water and oxygen are consumed, but these are naturally available in the environment. Thus, we have a material at our disposal which practically continuously produces a certain amount of fresh hydrogen peroxide, one of the most effective biocidal compounds,\" says Dr. Laskowski and emphasizes that tests verifying the biocidal effects of all new materials have been carried out at the IFiZZ PAS.Bioactive nanocomposites with metal ions are currently being produced at IFJ PAN on a laboratory scale, with the possibility of supplying trial quantities for implementation purposes. However, the production technology, which is at the patent stage, can be scaled up to industrial needs without major problems.The most recent study is published in the journal Molecules.

  "text": "Sometimes the best things in life come by chance, when we happen to be in the right place at the right time. Now, researchers from Japan have found a way to ensure that new medications are delivered to the right place in the body and at the right timepoint in disease progression, so that they have the best effect.          In a study published recently in the Journal of Nanobiotechnology, researchers led by Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU) have revealed that a novel delivery system delivers treatment to where it is needed most in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD).AD is a common neurodegenerative disease that causes dementia. It is characterized by the accumulation of a protein called amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) in the brain, and a number of different toxic forms of A\u03b2 have been identified that impair brain function, notably A\u03b2 oligomers (A\u03b2Os).\"Multiple clinical trials have attempted to use an anti-A\u03b2 antibody to treat AD, but the results have been unsatisfactory,\" says lead author of the study Akiko Amano. \"One potential explanation for this is that the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) prevents most full-length antibodies from entering the brain.\"To address this challenge, the researchers previously developed glucosylated (sugar-linked) polymeric nanomicelles (PMs), which are tiny, hollow balls that could successfully cross the BBB via transcytosis in mouse brain capillary endothelial cells; this process was mediated by glucose-transporter-1 and induced by an increase in blood glucose levels after the mice experienced fasting conditions.In this study, Takanori Yokota and colleagues filled PMs with fragments of an anti-A\u03b2O antibody, injected them into a mouse model of AD, and assessed the effects on the brain and on behavior.\"The results were very clear,\" explains senior author Nobuo Sanjo. \"Administration of anti-A\u03b2O antibody fragments through PMs significantly reduced the amounts of various toxic A\u03b2 species. In addition, the A\u03b2 plaques that did form were smaller and less dense than those seen in untreated mice.\"Next, the researchers analyzed the behavior of the mice and found that the mice treated with the antibody fragment-filled PMs had better learning and spatial memory than untreated mice. \"Our findings suggest that delivering sufficient levels of antibodies to the brain using PMs can reduce toxic A\u03b2 species and slow AD progression in mice,\" says Amano.Given that the failure of anti-A\u03b2 antibodies to improve cognitive function in human clinical trials was likely because of an insufficient supply of the antibodies in the brain, PM-encapsulated antibody fragments could represent an effective way to prevent AD progression. In addition, new candidates for AD treatment that degrade toxic A\u03b2s and reduce their toxic effects could also be delivered to the brain using the same PM-based system.

  "text": "Scientists have devised a way of fabricating a complex structure, previously found only in nature, to open up new ways for manipulating and controlling light.          The structure, which naturally occurs in the wing scales of some species of butterfly, can function as a photonic crystal, according to a new study by researchers at the University of Birmingham. It can be used to control light in the visible range of the spectrum, for applications for lasers, sensors, and also devices for harvesting solar energy.Their computational study, published in Advanced Materials, demonstrates that the complex gyroid structure can be self-assembled from designer colloidal particles in the range of hundreds of nanometers.The gyroid is typically known as a curved surface, which divides space into two interwoven channels. Each of these channels can have a network representation of linked vertices with three-fold connectivity and corkscrews through space in a particular direction, right or left. This twist makes each network chiral\u2014the mirror images cannot be superimposed on each other, like left and right hands. This is important because the chirality imparts additional optical properties to a photonic crystal.The chirality is lost, however, when the two networks of opposite handedness are together in the form of the double gyroid structure. This occurs in certain synthetic systems.In this work, the team of researchers first presents a single network gyroid structure built from colloidal spheres as a target for self-assembly\u2014the nature's way of building architectures\u2014before establishing the design principles for fabricating this chiral crystalline structure in computer simulations.Dr. Angela Demetriadou, a co-author from the School of Physics and Astronomy, has said, \"This is a new and exciting way to fabricate nanophotonic media with exceptional and tailored chiro-optical properties, with immense control over their properties.\"So far, the focus on self-assembling colloidal photonic crystals has been mostly on diamond-structures. Self-assembly of colloidal diamond presents a number of challenges, including the requirement of selecting the cubic form over its hexagonal counterpart for their practical applications as photonic crystals in optical devices.The new approach established in this work involves patchy spheres, which have a designer decorated surface to encode the information of the target structure\u2014the single colloidal gyroid. The decorated parts of the surface are sticky to bring the particles together to form the network structure. In addition, the work shows that the single colloidal gyroid also has intriguing optical properties by virtue of its chirality, which is lacking in a diamond structure.Dr. Dwaipayan Chakrabarti, the corresponding author from the School of Chemistry at the University of Birmingham, has said, \"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of direct self-assembly of single colloidal gyroid structures from designer building blocks. We hope that our novel approach will stimulate further investigations in the field of colloidal self-assembly, especially experimental efforts to build on this exciting development.\"This excitement is echoed by Professor Stefano Sacanna, a Professor at New York University with world-leading expertise in the synthesis of colloids and self-assembly of new materials, who is not involved in this study. He has said, \"With their work, Chakrabarti and co-workers bring an exciting new target to the attention of the colloidal self-assembly community. Using just spheres with a clever patchy design, their bottom-up routes to colloidal gyroid structures pave the way for a new generation of experimentally achievable photonic crystals.\" More information:Wesley Flavell et al, Programmed Self\u2010Assembly of Single Colloidal Gyroid for Chiral Photonic Crystals, Advanced Materials (2023).

  "text": "The Laboratory of Molecular Nanotechnology (NANOMOL) of the University of Alicante (UA) has developed a new family of materials as a state-of-the-art opportunity for the chemical industry, renewables, and the reduction of pollutants. The finding, published in the journal Nature Communications, opens up numerous possibilities for sectors such as energy and pharmaceuticals.          In general, scientists are looking to make highly ordered materials. For example, zeolites, the most important and widely used family of catalysts in the chemical industry, are made of periodically repeating units. According to Noem\u00ed Linares, UA researcher and author of the paper, scientists have moved away from materials that are somewhere between messy and orderly, where the opportunities are endless. They have realized that in the imperfect and unordered materials, there are countless opportunities to make new materials with unique properties.In the defective and disordered nature, there are not the limitations often imposed by regular structures, which opens up endless opportunities for the creation and design of materials, as explained by Javier Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, professor of Inorganic Chemistry at the UA and director of NANOMOL. Based on this idea, UA researchers have built materials that are halfway between ordered structures, called zeolites.These hybrid materials have important advantages such as a high surface area, which allows them to transform very bulky molecules, something that was not possible with conventional zeolites so far, which have very narrow pores. In particular, it is on the borderline between ordered and disordered material, which has irregular but very large cavities that allow more complex and bulky molecules to be transformed as defined by the researcher and author of the article, M\u00f3nica J. Mendoza Castro.In order to obtain these materials, the University of Alicante team of researchers has used a well-known process that allows one zeolite to be transformed into another, but interrupting this conversion to obtain intermediate half-made materials, which contain characteristics of both solids. UA professor explains the process as if they had stopped the transformation of a worm into a butterfly, when it is not yet complete, and at that point they have discovered that at that stage there is something completely new, fascinating and with innumerable applications.The finding presents a revolution in the field of catalysis that is key to making the chemical industry more sustainable. In this case, as reported by Noem\u00cd Linares in the article published in Nature Communications, they selected the most interesting parts of each zeolite to make something new and with the most suitable composition for each application. Additionally, the structural flexibility of the materials designed by the UA allows the molecules to enter and exit more easily, reducing carbon waste and CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.

  "answer_squad": " much lower than that of indium tin oxide",
  "text": "There are many sputtered metal film heaters on the market, but they are opaque and can only be used on the back of an anti-counterfeiting label. In addition, the heating rate is slow and the bending resistance is usually poor.          A research team led by Prof. Ji Shulin from the Hefei Institutes of Physical Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences came up with a solution. They developed a novel transparent heating film made of silver nanowires that can be used to fabricate a paper-based silver nanowire film heater. Its film resistance is much lower than that of indium tin oxide.Under the low voltage of a micro battery, rapid temperature change can be realized. Combined with thermochromic inks of different discoloration temperatures and discoloration directions, the film would achieve an intelligent anti-counterfeiting discoloration effect.Prof. Ji has been working on this project for years and now expects this mature technology to be marketed commercially.The heating system is based on the percolative heat exchange of silver nanowires; the film is optically transparent and does not interfere with high-definition display on paper, plastic and other substrates.Physicists print multiple and overlapping high-resolution thermochromic patterns onto the substrate. The corresponding spatial position of each pattern and the discoloration directions of thermochromic inks, as well as the discoloration temperatures, are different.The heat exchange coefficient between the heater and the thermochromic object is adjusted by manipulating the percolation structure of the silver nanowire film, and the transformation type and speed of the thermochromic patterns can be controlled by the accurate spatio-temporal response of temperature under a series of set voltages.Since the combination of discoloration temperature and direction is unknown, simply application of friction heat or fire discoloration by imitators cannot show the required discoloration switch. In this way, the real intelligent anti-counterfeiting or complex display effect can be realized.At the same time, thanks to the high optical transmittance of the invisible heater, the heater and the discoloration pattern are located on the same side of the substrate, avoiding the slow heat exchange across the substrate and heat capacity loss. As a result, low power consumption can be achieved under the built-in micro battery drive.This heating technology is used to drive the complex changes of multiple groups of high-resolution thermochromic patterns to achieve high-end visual requirements.This intelligent discoloration technology has overcome the limitations of electrochromic, photochromic, hydrochromic and pressure-sensitive discoloration technology. It's expected to be applied in the fields of anti-counterfeiting, secrecy, intelligent display, etc. Provided byChinese Academy of SciencesCitation:Researchers develop novel silver nanowire transparent heating films (2023, March 9)retrieved 30 May 2023from https://phys.org/news/2023-03-silver-nanowire-transparent.html  This document is subject to copyright.

  "text": "Due to their considerable efficiency, catalysts made of just a few atoms show great promise in the field of water treatment. In a new study, researchers looked into how to optimize the performance of these catalysts and make them viable for practical use.          The results of the study, led by Prof. Jaehong Kim, are published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.In the last few decades, nanoscale catalysts have drawn much attention in the field of water treatment. Materials at the nanoscale have numerous unique and beneficial properties to offer. More recently, researchers have been exploring the possibilities of single-atom catalysts. Even smaller than nanomaterials, these catalysts can offer even greater efficiency.\"We didn't have this capability before, but now we are basically loading single-atom metals, atom by atom, onto the substrate,\" said Kim, the Henry P. Becton Sr. Professor of Chemical & Environmental Engineering. \"And that's great, because you can utilize all of the atom.\"Efficiency is critical because the materials that are commonly used for catalysts can be very expensive. For instance, palladium (currently going for about $2,000 per ounce) is a metal that's often used for catalysts. A quick comparison shows why single-atom catalysts have generated so much interest. In nanoscale form, 50 nanometers of palladium cost about $37 to cover an area of about 250 square meters. Just over 2% of its atoms are exposed at the surface. In single-atom form, in contrast, palladium costs only 17 cents to cover an area greater than 50 football fields. And you can't beat it for efficiency, with 100% atom exposure at the surface.One limitation of the single-atom catalysts is that certain conditions can diminish their catalytic performance. As a solution to that, researchers have now begun creating catalysts comprising a small cluster of atoms, known as ensembles. Instead of the thousands of atoms that make up a nanomaterial, these clusters contain just three or four atoms. \"But they exhibit properties more like a single atom because they're such a small cluster, and the atoms are all exposed at the surface,\" Kim said.Because this material design is still relatively new, researchers are still figuring out the best ways to control the properties of these ensemble structures and optimize their performance. For instance, fully isolated single-atom catalysts can be enhanced by the addition of certain elements around the metals. Kim and his research team investigated whether atom ensembles could be similarly manipulated. Their paper is the first to explore the possibilities of doing so.Kim created a system with a catalyst using an ensemble of palladium atoms, designed to reduce the carcinogen bromate in water. They introduced the non-metal elements sulfur, nitrogen, and boron to the surrounds of atom ensembles. The overall results suggested an improvement in the system's catalytic performance. It's a promising sign, Kim said, especially since water treatment needs to be as cost-effective as possible.\"Ultimately, we are hoping to have a highly efficient device that has this catalyst to destroy pollutants in water, because it is going to be so much cheaper and efficient than other material designs,\" he said.

The study was published online in PNAS.Boron, which is next to carbon in the periodic table, has one electron less than carbon. This electron deficiency gives rise to its strong bonding ability and diverse boron polymorphs. Despite their variations, all boron polymorphs have as their building blocks B12 clusters, which have an icosahedral cage structure. However, research combining experimental and theoretical approaches has shown that small boron clusters in the gas phase, such as Bn (n = 3 to 12, 36), are planar or quasi-planar.This property has opened up the possibility of two-dimensional (2D) boron, also known as borophene.

However, previous studies have mainly focused on small boron clusters in the gas phase, and only a few theoretical studies have investigated the evolution of boron clusters from small clusters to 2D sheets on surfaces.In this study, the researchers discovered that, the growth of boron atoms onto a Cu(111) surface covered with a monolayer of borophene could generate boron clusters with a unique size distribution. Each boron cluster binds selectively to specific sites in each unit cell of the borophene monolayer, resulting in periodic arrays.

  "answer_race": " Shape-memory alloys for nanoscale machines",
  "question_squad": " What is the smallest sample size on which shape memory can be observed?",
  "answer_squad": " 50 nanometers",
  "text": "Alloys that can return to their original structure after being deformed have a so-called shape memory. This phenomenon and the resulting forces are used in many mechanical actuating systems, for example in generators or hydraulic pumps. However, it has not been possible to use this shape-memory effect at a small nanoscale. Objects made of shape-memory alloy can only change back to their original shape if they are larger than around 50 nanometers.          Researchers led by Salvador Pan\u00e9, Professor of Materials of Robotics at ETH Zurich, and Xiang-Zhong Chen, a senior scientist in his group, were able to circumvent this limitation using ceramic materials. In a study published in the journal Nature Communications, they demonstrate the shape-memory effect on a layer that is about twenty nanometers thick and made of materials called ferroic oxides. This achievement now makes it possible to apply the shape-memory effect to tiny nanoscale machines.A special structure is neededAt first glance, ferroic oxides do not appear to be very suitable for the shape-memory effect: They are brittle in bulk scale, and in order to produce very thin layers of them, they usually have to be fixed onto a substrate, which makes them inflexible. In order to still be able to induce the shape-memory effect, the researchers used two different oxides, barium titanate and cobalt ferrite, of which they temporarily applied thin layers onto a magnesium oxide substrate. The lattice parameters of the two oxides differ significantly from each other. After the researchers had detached the two-layered strip from the supporting substrate, the tension between the two oxides generated a spiral-shaped twisted structure.Such free-standing nanoscale structures made of ferroic oxides are highly elastic, resilient, and they allow flexible movements. Furthermore, they showed a shape-memory effect: When the researchers applied mechanical tensile force to the structure, it stretched out and permanently deformed. Subsequently, the scientists directed an electron beam from a scanning electron microscope onto the deformed structure; it returned to its original shape. The electrical energy thus triggered a shape-memory effect. The layer thickness of about twenty nanometers is the smallest sample size on which such an effect has ever been observed.Usually, in other examples, the shape-memory effect is triggered by thermal or magnetic manipulation. \"The reason it works with electrical irradiation in ferroic oxides may have to do with the orientation of the polarization within the oxides, we suspect,\" says Chen. While the free-standing structure is being stretched, the polarization within the oxides aligns parallel to the structure plane. The electron beam, however, leads the polarization to align perpendicular to the structure plane, causing change of the mechanical strain and contract to its original shape.                The scientists produced the nano-objects using thin-film deposition and dry etching. Credit: Kim D et al, Nature Communications 2023             Broad range of applicationsThis response to the electrical energy is more suitable for wide range of applications, because punctual temperature manipulations (conventionally used to induce shape memory) are not possible at the nanoscale. One example of an application: Thanks to their high elasticity, the oxides could replace muscle fibers or parts of the spine.\"Other applications would be new nanoscale robotic systems: The mechanical movement that occurs when switching between the two structures could be used to drive tiny motors,\" says Donghoon Kim. He worked as a doctoral student on this study and is one of its two lead authors. \"Furthermore, our approach could also facilitate the development of longer-lasting small-scale machines, because the material is not only elastic but also durable,\" says Minsoo Kim, postdoc and also a lead author.The range of applications can even be extended to flexible electronics and soft robotic systems. In another study, which the researchers have just published in the journal Advanced Materials Technologies, they were able to further develop such free standing oxide structures so that their magnetoelectric properties can be controlled and tuned more precisely. Such shape memory oxides could be used, among other things, to manufacture nanorobots that are implanted in the body and can stimulate cells or repair tissue. Through external magnetic fields, the the nanorobots can be triggered to transform into a different shape and perform specific functions within a human body.\"Furthermore, the magnetoelectric properties of these shape-memory oxide structures could be used, among other things, to electrically stimulate cells within the body, for example to activate neuronal cells in brains, for cardiac therapies, or for accelerating bone healing process,\" Pan\u00e9 says. Finally, the magnetoelectric shape-memory oxides could be used in nanoscale devices, such as tiny antennas or sensors.

  "text": "University of Central Florida researcher Debashis Chanda, a professor in UCF's NanoScience Technology Center, has drawn inspiration from butterflies to create the first environmentally friendly, large-scale and multicolor alternative to pigment-based colorants, which can contribute to energy-saving efforts and help reduce global warming.          The development was published today in Science Advances as a featured article.\"The range of colors and hues in the natural world are astonishing\u2014from colorful flowers, birds and butterflies to underwater creatures like fish and cephalopods,\" Chanda says. \"Structural color serves as the primary color-generating mechanism in several extremely vivid species where geometrical arrangement of typically two colorless materials produces all colors. On the other hand, with manmade pigment, new molecules are needed for every color present.\"Based on such bio-inspirations, Chanda's research group innovated a plasmonic paint, which utilizes nanoscale structural arrangement of colorless materials\u2014aluminum and aluminum oxide\u2014instead of pigments to create colors.While pigment colorants control light absorption based on the electronic property of the pigment material and hence every color needs a new molecule, structural colorants control the way light is reflected, scattered or absorbed based purely on the geometrical arrangement of nanostructures.Such structural colors are environmentally friendly as they only use metals and oxides, unlike present pigment-based colors that use artificially synthesized molecules.The researchers have combined their structural color flakes with a commercial binder to form long-lasting paints of all colors.\"Normal color fades because pigment loses its ability to absorb photons,\" Chanda says. \"Here, we're not limited by that phenomenon. Once we paint something with structural color, it should stay for centuries.\"Additionally, because plasmonic paint reflects the entire infrared spectrum, less heat is absorbed by the paint, resulting in the underneath surface staying 25 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than it would if it were covered with standard commercial paint, the researcher says.\"Over 10% of total electricity in the U.S. goes toward air conditioner usage,\" Chanda says. \"The temperature difference plasmonic paint promises would lead to significant energy savings. Using less electricity for cooling would also cut down carbon dioxide emissions, lessening global warming.\"Plasmonic paint is also extremely lightweight, the researcher says.This is due to the paint's large area-to-thickness ratio, with full coloration achieved at a paint thickness of only 150 nanometers, making it the lightest paint in the world, Chanda says.The paint is so lightweight that only about 3 pounds of plasmonic paint could cover a Boeing 747, which normally requires more than 1,000 pounds of conventional paint, he says.Chanda says his interest in structural color stems from the vibrancy of butterflies.\"As a kid, I always wanted to build a butterfly,\" he says. \"Color draws my interest.\"Future researchChanda says the next steps of the project include further exploration of the paint's energy-saving aspects to improve its viability as commercial paint.\"The conventional pigment paint is made in big facilities where they can make hundreds of gallons of paint,\" he says. \"At this moment, unless we go through the scale-up process, it is still expensive to produce at an academic lab.\"\"We need to bring something different like, non-toxicity, cooling effect, ultralight weight, to the table that other conventional paints can't,\" Chanda says.

  "text": "Research in animal models has demonstrated that stem-cell derived heart tissues have promising potential for therapeutic applications to treat cardiac disease. But before such therapies are viable and safe for use in humans, scientists must first precisely understand on the cellular and molecular levels which factors are necessary for implanted stem-cell derived heart cells to properly grow and integrate in three dimensions within surrounding tissue.          New findings from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) make it possible for the first time to monitor the functional development and maturation of cardiomyocytes\u2014the cells responsible for regulating the heartbeat through synchronized electrical signals\u2014on the single-cell level using tissue-embedded nanoelectronic devices. The devices\u2014which are flexible, stretchable, and can seamlessly integrate with living cells to create \"cyborgs\"\u2014are reported in a Science Advances paper.\"These mesh-like nanoelectronics, designed to stretch and move with growing tissue, can continuously capture long-term activity within individual stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes of interest,\" says Jia Liu, co-senior author on the paper, who is an assistant professor of bioengineering at SEAS, where he leads a lab dedicated to bioelectronics.Liu's team, which specializes in engineering nanoelectronics to bridge the gap between living tissue and electronics, has developed several mesh-like, minimally invasive flexible nanoelectronic sensors designed to be embedded with natural tissues without disturbing normal cellular grown or function.\"Nature showed us the solution to monitoring tissue in 3D,\" Liu says. \"We were inspired by the way neural tubes fold during development, stretching as cells migrate and take shape into tissue volume.\"                Over the course of seven weeks of monitoring the developing organoids, the team observed cardiomyocytes cultured next to endothelial cells matured faster compared to cardiomyocytes located farther away from endothelial cells. Credit: Liu Lab, Harvard SEAS             His team created their first cyborg organoid in 2019 to test the idea of using a mesh-like nanoelectronic structure, and has previously demonstrated that these types of flexible nanoelectronics can be safely implanted into living mice without disrupting the function of nearby cells.In their latest study, Liu's lab joined forces with Richard Lee and his team at Harvard Stem Cell Institute and used the nanoelectronics to monitor electrical activity of stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes. To do so, the researchers cultured cells onto a sheet made of commercially available cellular matrix known as \"Matrigel\" and the mesh-like nanoelectronic sensor (which contains a flexible grid of microelectrodes).      As the cells grew and developed into a small organoid structure, the researchers observed that the sheet easily stretched and accommodated the stem-cell derived tissues as they proliferated and expanded in 3D.Using these techniques in in vitro experiments, the team discovered that the blood vessel lining cells that regulate blood flow between vessels and surrounding tissues (called endothelial cells) play a previously underestimated but crucial role in the rapid and functional maturation of stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes. When cultured together in a 3D cardiac tissue matrix, cardiomyocytes underwent \"extraordinary electrical maturation\" in the presence of endothelial cells.Over the course of seven weeks of monitoring the developing organoids, the team observed that proximity to endothelial cells had a direct impact. Cardiomyocytes cultured next to endothelial cells matured faster compared to cardiomyocytes located farther away from endothelial cells, and they also displayed electrical characteristics typically found in healthy heart tissue.The new insight is a leap forward for engineering stem-cell derived cardiac tissues. Experimental preclinical research in animals with human-like hearts has proven it's difficult to engineer and transplant stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes that can beat in tandem with surrounding heart tissue for extended periods of time. Immature cardiomyocytes transplanted into an animal's heart tend to beat to their own drum, and this electrical misfire can cause dangerous irregular heartbeats.That's why the discovery that co-culturing stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes with endothelial cells can create more functionally mature cardiomyocytes is so significant.                Over the course of seven weeks of monitoring the developing organoids, the team observed cardiomyocytes cultured next to endothelial cells matured faster compared to cardiomyocytes located farther away from endothelial cells, and they also displayed electrical characteristics typically found in healthy heart tissue. Credit: Liu Lab, Harvard SEAS             In their new paper, the team also describes using a novel machine-learning-based analysis to interpret the electrical activity captured by the tissue-embedded nanoelectronic devices, enabling continuous monitoring of the electrical waves generated by maturing cardiomyocytes of interest and enabling a better understanding of how the tissue microenvironment influences electrical stability.Liu says the nanoelectronic devices and machine-learning-based analysis represent new platform technologies for monitoring and managing stem-cell derived tissue implants\u2014enabling scientists to culture cyborgs made from both living tissues and electronics that can be controlled with a high degree of specificity.In cardiac tissues, he envisions that someday these cyborgs could even be used in a sophisticated, real-time feedback system to detect abnormal electrical activity in cardiomyocytes and provide highly targeted voltage, acting like a nanoscale pacemaker, to help correct implanted cells and ensure they continue to beat in rhythm with the rest of the heart.\"If we have both nanoelectronic sensors and stimulators, we can monitor electrical activity and use feedback to pace implanted tissues into the same frequency as surrounding tissues,\" Liu says. \"This approach could be adapted to so many other types of stem-cell-derived tissues, such as neuronal tissues and pancreatic organoids.\"He also says this nanoelectronics platform approach could be used in drug screening, providing single-cell-level, continuous analysis of how tissues respond to different compounds and therapies.

  "text": "Researchers at Empa, ETH Zurich and the Politecnico di Milano are developing a new type of computer component that is more powerful and easier to manufacture than its predecessors. Inspired by the human brain, it is designed to process large amounts of data fast and in an energy-efficient way.          In many respects, the human brain is still superior to modern computers. Although most people can't do math as fast as a computer, we can effortlessly process complex sensory information and learn from experiences, while a computer cannot\u2014at least not yet. And, the brain does all this by consuming less than half as much energy as a laptop.One of the reasons for the brain's energy efficiency is its structure. The individual brain cells\u2014the neurons and their connections, the synapses\u2014can both store and process information. In computers, however, the memory is separate from the processor, and data must be transported back and forth between these two components. The speed of this transfer is limited, which can slow down the whole computer when working with large amounts of data.One possible solution to this bottleneck are novel computer architectures that are modeled on the human brain. To this end, scientists are developing so-called memristors: components that, like brain cells, combine data storage and processing. A team of researchers from Empa, ETH Zurich and the Politecnico di Milano has now developed a memristor that is more powerful and easier to manufacture than its predecessors. The researchers have recently published their results in the journal Science Advances.Performance through mixed ionic and electronic conductivityThe novel memristors are based on halide perovskite nanocrystals, a semiconductor material known from solar cell manufacturing. \"Halide perovskites conduct both ions and electrons,\" explains Rohit John, former ETH Fellow and postdoctoral researcher at both ETH Zurich and Empa. \"This dual conductivity enables more complex calculations that closely resemble processes in the brain.\"The researchers conducted the experimental part of the study entirely at Empa: They manufactured the thin-film memristors at the Thin Films and Photovoltaics laboratory and investigated their physical properties at the Transport at Nanoscale Interfaces laboratory. Based on the measurement results, they then simulated a complex computational task that corresponds to a learning process in the visual cortex in the brain. The task involved determining the orientation of light based on signals from the retina.\"As far as we know, this is only the second time this kind of computation has been performed on memristors,\" says Maksym Kovalenko, professor at ETH Zurich and head of the Functional Inorganic Materials research group at Empa. \"At the same time, our memristors are much easier to manufacture than before.\" This is because, in contrast to many other semiconductors, perovskites crystallize at low temperatures. In addition, the new memristors do not require the complex preconditioning through application of specific voltages that comparable devices need for such computing tasks. This makes them faster and more energy-efficient.      Complementing rather than replacingThe technology, though, is not quite ready for deployment yet. The ease with which the new memristors can be manufactured also makes them difficult to integrate with existing computer chips: Perovskites cannot withstand temperatures of 400 to 500 degrees Celsius that are needed to process silicon\u2014at least not yet. But according to Daniele Ielmini, professor at the \"Politecnico di Milano,\" that integration is key to the success for new brain-like computer technologies.\"Our goal is not to replace classical computer architecture,\" he explains. \"Rather, we want to develop alternative architectures that can perform certain tasks faster and with greater energy efficiency. This includes, for example, the parallel processing of large amounts of data, which is generated everywhere today, from agriculture to space exploration.\"Promisingly, there are other materials with similar properties that could be used to make high-performance memristors. \"We can now test our memristor design with different materials,\" says Alessandro Milozzi, a doctoral student at the Politecnico di Milano. \"It is quite possible that some of them are better suited for integration with silicon.\" More information:Rohit Abraham John et al, Ionic-electronic halide perovskite memdiodes enabling neuromorphic computing with a second-order complexity, Science Advances (2022).

  "text": "The amount of surface oxygen in graphene materials is a key factor in how effective they could be in killing bacteria\u2014a discovery which may help to design safer and more effective products to combat antimicrobial resistance.          Graphene oxide with high surface oxygen content (SOC) is very flexible and can wrap around bacteria (a parallel mode of contact), but when it has lower SOC the material has higher rigidity and tends to contact bacteria edgewise (in a perpendicular mode).Neither mode necessarily kills bacteria, but bactericidal activity depends on how the material interacts with surrounding biomolecules. The discovery will help scientists to understand the different possible physical mechanisms leading to their antibacterial activity.Publishing their findings in ACS nano, an international group of scientists from the UK, Cyprus, Austria, Finland, The Netherlands and China reveal that it is graphene oxide's different interaction modes that lead to distinct antibacterial activity\u2014with a 'switch' occurring when surface oxygen levels reach a certain threshold.A slight change of SOC can lead to the shift of interaction modes between parallel and perpendicular contact. \"The impact of SOC on the interaction mode has been underestimated for a long time,\" commented Dr. Zhiling Guo, from the University of Birmingham.Dr. Peng Zhang, from the University of Birmingham, commented, \"Our research highlights that surface oxygen levels can help to evaluate the antibacterial effects of graphene materials\u2014helping to design safer materials through clarifying the role of SOC.\"As antimicrobials, graphene materials may have advantages over traditional antibiotics due to their physical mechanisms of action which ensure less chance of development of microbial resistance.Until now, the fundamental question as to whether the antibacterial mechanism of graphene materials originates from parallel interaction or perpendicular interaction, or from a combination of these, remains poorly understood\u2014hindering progress in developing antibacterial graphene materials and understanding their environmental safety.Professor Iseult Lynch, from the University of Birmingham, said, \"The discovery is a potential 'gamechanger' and we should be using this surface oxygen 'switch' as the determining property to define and classify graphene materials in the context of human health and environmental safety.\"The UK- led international research team created a series of graphene materials with different SOCs and compared their antibacterial performance\u2014evaluating total cell growth, biofilm formation and oxidative stress, as well as physical interactions with bacteria including through molecular simulations.Different interaction modes lead to distinct antibacterial activity and interaction mode is highly related to the rigidity of the graphene materials which depends on the amount of surface oxygen.The antibacterial activity of graphene materials was reported as early as 2010. The material has been used to create antibacterial fabrics for maternity garments which can prevent microbial growth on the fabric surface. Graphene-coated nonwoven fabrics have been used to produce antibacterial masks, while graphene-based membranes have been extensively studied for water treatment because of their ultrafast water transport and antifouling activity.

  "text": "Sustainable energy solutions cannot be pulled out of thin air. However, combining air with metal and other frameworks may pave the way for environmentally friendly energy conversion and storage, according to a research team based in China.          They published their review of novel porous materials\u2014called metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs)\u2014and their potential to advance metal-air batteries in Nano Research Energy.The porous crystal material frameworks comprise various arrangements of bonded materials that can induce desired properties, including the ability to accelerate reactions between oxygen and metals for energy conversion and storage. Their diverse arrangements facilitate flexibility, with high porosity and surface area, allowing for the best chance of the necessary reactions. Their derivates, or products derived from the frameworks, also enhance previously insufficient electronic conductivity and improve chemical stability.But their advancement has been limited by inadequate conductivity and stability, according to co-corresponding author Tao Wang, professor, Centre for Hydrogenergy, College of Materials Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\"Metal-air batteries, with high specific energy, moderate pricing, high safety and environmental friendliness, are the most promising candidate for energy storage and conversion,\" Wang said. \"At present, however, metal-air batteries involve a complex catalytic process of gas-liquid-solid phases, making it difficult to deeply understand the mechanism of discharge and recharge processes.\"Wang also noted that some of the MOF and COF arrangements have slow reaction kinetics, meaning an efficient catalyst is needed both to reduce potential conversion challenges and improve the battery's life cycle.To better understand how to control benefits\u2014and mitigate the challenges\u2014of the frameworks and their derivates, the researchers reviewed the current available scientific literature. Among other insights, they found that the frameworks exhibit a unique molecular structure that enables high porosity with uniform distribution of catalytic sites, meaning their reactions can be more predictable than with other porous materials.\"By systematically studying the effects between organic components and catalytic active centers of MOFs and COFs, we can gain a theoretical basis for us to select and synthesize the desired framework catalysts in the future,\" Wang said. \"We can also better understand the local microenvironment in MOFs and COFs and how it impacts the overall catalytic effect.\"Wang and the team recommend further study of how to better prepare functionalized MOFs and COFs based on their reaction mechanism; of hybrid MOFs and COFs; and of the composition control and morphology of MOF and COF derivates. They also recommend developing more advanced techniques to detect the vibration signals of molecules on the electrode surface and observe the conversion process to fully elucidate the relationship between the structure and the performance.\"By comprehensively reviewing the advantages, challenges and prospects of MOFs and COFs, we hope that the organic framework materials will shed more profound insights into the development of electrocatalysis and energy storage in the future,\" Wang said.

  "text": "Macrophages are highly specialized cells of the immune system that help the body detect and fight deadly pathogens. In particular, M1-like macrophages detect and destroy tumor cells, and release protective chemokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor-necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF \u03b1), thus shielding the body from life-threatening pathologies like cancer.          However, not all macrophages show anti-tumor potential. Certain types of macrophages, i.e., M2-like macrophages, promote tumor growth. Luckily, the desired macrophage phenotype\u2014a set of traits resulting from the genetic makeup of the macrophage\u2014can be activated by modulating the physiological microenvironment of the cells. Interestingly, multiple nanomaterial-based immunomodulators have been developed in the past, which are known to facilitate the phenotype transition of macrophages from M0 to M1.Recently, a team of researchers led by Dr. Na Kong and Dr. Yuan Yao from the ShanghaiTech University, China, conducted a study to design novel immunomodulators\u2014biomimetic polypeptides (BMPPs)\u2014that could activate tumor-infiltrating macrophages, i.e., M1-like macrophages. Their study was published in BioDesign Research.Elaborating on the development of BMPPs, Dr. Yao remarks, \"Combining de novo protein design and biosynthesis techniques, we designed a BMPP self-assembled nano-immunomodulator to trigger the activation of a specific macrophage phenotype. It was intended to be made up of (GGSGGPGGGPASAAANSASRATSNSP)n, the RGD motif from collagen, and the IKVAV motif from laminin.\"It is important to note, that previously developed nano-immunomodulators exhibited clear limitations, such as biotoxicity and low biocompatibility.To overcome such limitations, Dr. Yao and team tried a unique approach. They designed and biosynthesized a biomimetic nanofibril\u2014a highly ordered and stable structure comprising self-assembled repetitive building blocks. To do so, they validated the predicted monomers and higher-order complexes using molecular dynamics simulations\u2014computational studies used to mimic the movement of atoms, molecules, or even large biomolecules such as polypeptides and proteins.The resultant BMPPs specifically harbored the RGD and IKVAV motifs\u2014small nature-conserved regions from proteins\u2014because prior studies have shown that these motifs contain amino acid residues with putative immunomodulatory capabilities.Following biosynthesis, the team conducted a variety of assays including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), to test the efficacy of the newly biosynthesized BMPPs. Cell proliferation assays conducted using RAW264.7 cells demonstrated the general biosafety and cytocompatibility of BMPPs. Moreover, results from ELISA revealed that BMPP nano-immunomodulators increased the protein expression levels of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1, without affecting the expression levels of IL-10.This clearly demonstrated that M1 macrophage polarization occurred at high BMPP concentrations and that BMPP nano-immunomodulators were presumably activating the M1-like macrophages.\"Unlike metal or synthetic polymer-based nanoparticles, these BMPPs exhibit excellent biocompatibility, high efficacy, and precise tunability in immunomodulatory effectiveness. With such encouraging findings, we are motivated to continue our research into cancer immunotherapy applications,\" says Dr. Yao.

  "text": "New research has shown that the blood vessels that feed aggressive brain tumors have receptors that could allow a new type of drug-containing nanoparticle to be used to starve the tumors of the energy they use to grow and spread, and also cause other disruptions to their adapted existence, even killing themselves.          Scientists from the University of Nottingham and Duke University have discovered that many of the blood vessels that feed high grade glioma brain tumors have high levels of low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR). The findings pave the way for using drugs already in development at both institutions that could target these receptors and so be taken up by the tumors. The results have just been published in Pharmaceutics in a new paper entitled, \"Low-Density Lipoprotein Pathway Is a Ubiquitous Metabolic Vulnerability in High Grade Glioma Amenable for Nanotherapeutic Delivery.\"Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors and originate from the glial cells of the brain. They are a heterogenous spectrum, from slow-growing to highly-aggressive infiltrating tumors. Nearly half of all gliomas are classed as high-grade gliomas (HGG) and due to their highly aggressive nature, have a dismal prognosis with an average survival of only 4.6 months without treatment and approximately 14 months with today's optimal multimodal treatments.The researchers examined tissue microarrays from intra- and inter-tumor regions of 36 adult and 133 pediatric patients to confirm LDLR as a therapeutic target. Expression levels in three representative cell line models were also tested to confirm their future utility to test LDLR-targeted nanoparticle uptake, retention, and cytotoxicity. They showed widespread LDLR expression in adult and pediatric cohorts, and, importantly, also categorized the intra-tumor variation observed between the core and either rim or invasive regions of adult high-grade gliomas.Dr. Ruman Rahman from the University of Nottingham's School of Medicine led the study and said, \"Brain tumors can be very hard to treat with the current techniques available, this is because many of the drugs or nanoparticles that have been shown to work in cells, when used in tests of clinical treatments cannot penetrate the blood brain barrier that many tumors sit behind. So, it's vital we look for new ways to treat them. These findings are a significant step in understanding the biology of tumors and how they gather energy to grow and spread like from the body's own fat and protein containing lipoprotein particles. The key now is to use drug and prodrug nanoparticles to target these receptors and cut off the energy supply of the cancer cells.\"      David Needham, professor of translational therapeutics in the School of Pharmacy at the University of Nottingham and Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science at Duke University has been working on developing new, more clinically-effective, formulations of a common metabolic inhibitor (niclosamide) that cuts off the energy of cells and could be modified as a treatment for a number of diseases\u2014including cancer.In its original anti-parasitic application, niclosamide has been used for over 60 years, taken as oral tablets, killing tapeworms on contact in the gut by inhibiting their crucial metabolic pathway and shutting down their energy supply. This same ability to lower the energy supply in a cell, has shown that niclosamide can also reduce the energy a virus needs to replicate (another formulation Needham has recently been developing as a nasal spray and early treatment throat spray for COVID19 and other respiratory-virus infections. For the sprays, Needham figured out how to increase the solubility of niclosamide in simple pH buffered solutions. However, niclosamide's poor solubility in water makes it very difficult to use elsewhere, such as in an intravenous injection or infusion.Professor Needham, who has been investigating this drug as a possible treatment for cancer for a number of years and has been driving research in this area and is co-author on this study, said, \"We know that niclosamide works by turning down the dimmer switch on host cells in the body, like in the nose as a preventative for COVID19 and other infections. Cancers, though, have developed additional strategies to survive and so have very different metabolic processes than normal cells. Niclosamide targets not only the energy production in the cells but also triggers other processes that result in what is called, apoptosis, (self-killing) in the cells. And now we know that brain tumors have LDL receptors that we think are used to feed their growth and meastatic spread we can work to modify the drug to target these and starve the cancer cells of their energy. Given that cancers feed on LDLS our strategy is to make the drug look like the cancer's food.\"Professor Needham and the team at Duke have developed the \"Bricks to Rocks Technology\" (B2RT) that makes this common low solubility drug (commonly called \"brick dust\") into even less soluble \"rocks\" for the purpose of making pure prodrug nanoparticles. They converted niclosamide into a new less soluble (niclosamide stearate) prodrug that allows the formation of the injectable or implantable nanoparticles. With data already obtained showing that the, so called \"niclosamide stearate prodrug therapeutic\" (NSPT) can stop the formation of lung metastases in a mouse model of osteosarcoma, and also actually cure some dogs in a small canine feasibility study.Professor Needham continues, \"This technology is now ready to be applied in other cancers, and Nottingham is ideally placed to develop this with the expertise at the Children's Brain Tumor Research Center. The next step will be to test the B2RT with Ruman and colleagues specifically in brain tumor cells, animal models and, if it shows promise, move it into patients as fast as feasibly and safely as possible. We want to determine if and to what extent LDLR-targeted anti-cancer drug and prodrug nanoparticles can have activity in brain cancer, both injected intravenously and/or as post-surgical deposits.\"Such LDLR-targeted nanoparticles have already been developed as a feasible formulation by another School of Pharmacy researcher, Jonathan Burley and his recent Ph.D. graduate George Bebawy who showed that they improved tumor cell uptake.

  "text": "Waste containing nanomaterials\u2014or nanowaste\u2014is an emerging safety concern worldwide, requiring environmentally sound management and regulation that still need to be established. Researchers at the University of Fribourg point out the gaps and provide first solutions for guidance.          Nanowaste includes manufacturing waste materials, end-of-life nano-enabled products, and waste (unintentionally) contaminated with engineered nanomaterials. More than 60 percent of engineered nanomaterials (up to 300,000 tons annually, and not including nanoplastics) are estimated to end up in landfill. And while there are currently no global definitions or classifications for nanomaterials or nanowaste, there is a need for tangible solutions related to risk assessment, categorization, labeling, collection, storage, transport, recycling, and elimination.In a commentary in Nature Nanotechnology, researchers from the Adolphe Merkle Institute's BioNanomaterials group, along with colleagues from the University of Fribourg and EPFL, are advocating for awareness of the issue, and the need for technical and legally binding nanowaste guidelines strictly based on the precautionary principle. These should rely on state-of-the-art knowledge of nanomaterial behavior, and a lenient definition of nanomaterials.Developing these initial guidelines requires case-by-case risk assessments of the specific nanowastes generated, a detailed understanding of national and international hazardous waste and materials regulations, and collaboration with laboratory staff to derive user-friendly ways to collect, store, and eliminate this waste.As the researchers point out, a series of measures have already been implemented, in collaboration with the University of Fribourg safety officers, at the Adolphe Merkle Institute. These include proper labeling and storage, due to the absence of nanowaste-specific regulations, according to national and international hazardous material legislation, detailed guidelines on how to dispose of nanowaste correctly, and consolidation of this waste into a few legally permissible categories.For research laboratories, such guidelines are especially important due to the high complexity of the waste generated, the presence of a great variety of untested materials, and the many different laboratory users, say the authors. More explicit rules for nanowaste, such as specific pictograms, could also help to harmonize nanowaste management in industry, prevent the misclassification of dangerous substances into nonhazardous categories, and avoid unintentional exposure of people and the environment to hazardous nanomaterials.The recommendations presented in the article are targeted at researchers and policymakers in academia and industry. To protect human health and the environment, the authors urge increased awareness and action to manage nanowaste, as well as the explicit inclusion of nanowaste management into multinational agreements. They also caution policymakers to avoid double standards that would stifle the replacement of more hazardous conventional chemicals with novel, less harmful and degradable nanomaterials.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the bacteriophage that can be used to kill bacteria?",
  "answer_squad": " NPs",
  "text": "The overuse of antibiotics over extended periods of time has led to the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in recent years. This poses a significant threat to public health, with more than 1.2 million deaths caused due to MDR bacteria. Moreover, progress in the research and development of new antibiotics has slowed down; most of the \"new\" antibiotics are modifications of prior existing drugs, with only a handful of novel chemical formulations being produced.          There is, however, hope in the form of tiny organism called bacteriophages. These viruses specifically infect bacteria, and therefore, represent a viable alternative against MDR bacteria, Phage therapy could also help avoid side-effects like dysbiosis (the disturbance of our own body's \"good bacteria\" by antibiotics), and is ecologically friendly. However, their species specificity is a double-edged sword, and may pose potential roadblocks to the clinical application of bacteriophages, coupled with their low bioavailability, and the risk of infectivity loss.But phage therapy is a work in progress, and to overcome these obstacles, alternative combinations are being explored. Nanotechnology has now emerged as a viable adjunct to phage therapy, and a review, which appeared online on January 4, 2023 and was published in the Biodesign Research journal, aims to gather research on biosensors and antibiotic therapy that employs both nanoparticles (NPs) and bacteriophages to detect and kill or deactivate bacteria.The corresponding author of this paper, Dr. Pilar Domingo-Calap from the Institute for Integrative Systems Biology in Spain, states, \"Gold and/or silver NPs can bind to bacteria and phages, facilitate the former's detection and the diagnosis of bacterial infection. These NPs can be detected via colorimetric, spectrometric, or electrochemical means. These NPs could also be attached to recognition elements such as aptamers, antibodies, enzymes, and DNA fragments, which facilitate a more efficient recognition and binding to bacteria and bacteriophages.\"So far, these have successfully been used to detect bacteria like Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, and Xanthomonas campestris. What's more, approaches employing these NPs are easy to operate and store, quick, and portable, highlighting their diagnostic potential.NPs can also work in sync with bacteriophages to kill bacteria, via photothermal therapy (PTT), which involves the release of heat, or photodynamic therapy, which involves the release of heat or reactive oxygen species. While the formation of bacterial biofilms deters this process by reducing the penetration capacity of the NPs, the use of enzymes to disrupt these structures is being explored, with DNase showing promise.      A combination of this enzyme with gold NPs has shown success in disrupting biofilms and killing bacterial strains such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa through PTT/PDT. Several phage-NP combinations are also being tested, with a M13 phage-gold nanorod (\"Phanorod\") formulation showing promise. However, further in vivo studies are needed to ensure that these formulations have no immunological side-effects.Dr. Domingo-Calap also discusses another avenue to improve phage therapy. \"Encapsulation of phages can reduce the elimination of bacteriophages, ensure their controlled release, and thus, ensure a steady supply of therapeutic against infection.\"The phages can be encapsulated in polymers, which are macromolecular structures with a large surface area-to-volume ratio, enabling their efficient loading and delivery. However, these polymers may also decrease the effectiveness of the treatment. They can, however, be synthetically generated, which allows better control on their properties. Polymer-encapsulated phages have shown to be highly effective against pulmonary infections caused by P. aeruginosa in subjects suffering from cystic fibrosis.This technology also has far-reaching implications for the eventual development of phage-based vaccines. However, the authors reiterate the importance of selecting an appropriate solvent during the synthesis of these polymers, as organic solvents are known to inactivate phage particles, reducing the effectiveness of the therapeutic.There is also a growing interest in lipid-based structures for the encapsulation and delivery of phages. Liposomes, which are double-layered phospholipids enclosed in an aqueous cavity, can be synthesized by a variety of techniques. Their small size allows for adherence to mucous-rich surfaces, as well as uptake by phagocytic cells, allowing them to reach intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Listeria spp., Salmonella spp., and Staphylococcus spp.Liposomes composed of cholesterol or polyethylene glycol (PEG) have proven effective in phage-mediated treatment of gastrointestinal infections, facilitating effective diffusion and bioavailability to different tissues, as well as protection of the phage particles from the host immune system. However, an important limitation that is highlighted by them is the small size of the liposomes, which restricts the type of phage that can be encapsulated, depending on its size.Dr. Domingo-Calap concludes by surmising, \"Phage-based nanotechnology can be a very promising and efficient alternative to overcoming antimicrobial resistance. It can be exploited in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of bacterial diseases. Although there is still a long way to go, especially at the regulatory level, phage-based nanotechnology is in the spotlight and future research in the field will improve the development of new antimicrobial products.\" More information:Marco Pardo-Freire et al, Phages and Nanotechnology: New Insights against Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria, BioDesign Research (2023).

  "text": "A team of researchers at NYU Abu Dhabi has developed a single-step, organic solvent-free, hydrothermal process to convert polyethylene-based plastic bags and polypropylene-based surgical masks into carbon dots.          An estimated 26,000 metric tons of pandemic-related plastic waste\u2014from medical waste to online shopping packaging\u2014have been released into the world's oceans, making it even more urgent to find efficient methods to upcycle this non-degradable material. One solution is to convert the single-use plastic into so-called carbon dots, carbon nanomaterials that are biocompatible, and have applications in the fields of biological imaging, environmental monitoring, chemical analysis, targeted drug delivery, disease diagnosis and therapy, and anti-counterfeiting. Existing methods to upcycle plastic into carbon dots involve multiple, time-consuming steps and utilize toxic chemicals.In the study titled \"High-yield, One-pot Upcycling of Polyethylene and Polypropylene Waste into Blue-Emissive Carbon Dots,\" published in the journal Green Chemistry, the researchers present the development of a new synthesis method, which is a simple, cost-effective, and highly scalable approach to upcycling plastic waste.Importantly, this oxidative degradation method can upcycle plastics contaminated with organic waste such as food scraps, which poses a significant challenge to traditional recycling technologies. The senior author is Khalil Ramadi, Assistant Professor of Bioengineering at NYUAD. Mohammed Abdelhameed, a scientist at NYUAD, and Mahmoud Elbeh, an NYUAD undergraduate student, are first authors of the study.The researchers also estimated the economic feasibility of the synthetic method by comparing the variable costs of this process to existing chemical recycling processes, considering the economic value of the created carbon dots. They found that the global market value of carbon dots is expected to reach $6.412 billion U.S. dollars by 2025, up from $2.496 billion in 2019\u2014a high commercial value that more than justifies the associated processing costs.The high volume of single-use plastics used during the pandemic, particularly surgical masks and medical waste, presents an increased need to find a solution for managing non-biodegradable waste. It is also estimated that only 14 percent of the eligible plastic packaging\u2014whose use has surged due to the boom in online shopping\u2014is recycled, with the rest ending up in landfills and oceans, where it does considerable harm. These materials can be consumed by organisms or fragmented into micro- and nano-plastics that can threaten terrestrial, marine, and freshwater ecosystems and, ultimately, human health.\"The new method our team has developed is a cost-effective and safe method that can be easily implemented to significantly reduce the amount of harmful plastic that is released into our ecosystems,\" said Ramadi. \"In addition to providing a new tool to protect our ecosystems, this approach can efficiently and responsibly produce carbon dots, a versatile nanotechnology whose potential applications are nearly boundless.\"Elbeh stated, \"We're very delighted to further support the UAE's Circular Economy Policy. Given that we are tackling the plastic waste crisis by creating a valuable product using a relatively easy-to-implement method, we're looking forward to more collaborations to not only scale up this project but also utilize the produced dots for further development and applications.\" More information:Mohammed Abdelhameed et al, High-yield, one-pot upcycling of polyethylene and polypropylene waste into blue-emissive carbon dots, Green Chemistry (2023).

  "answer_squad": " surfactants",
  "text": "Researchers in Japan have developed a new method for purifying cholesterol-modified DNA nanostructures that could be used to functionalize molecular robot bodies (lipid vesicles). The study was a collaboration between Yusuke Sato of Kyushu Institute of Technology and Shin-ichiro M. Nomura of the Tohoku University, and the work was published in ChemBioChem.          To purify the DNA nanostructures, the researchers first mixed surfactants with the materials for the DNA six-helix bundles with four cholesterol-modified DNA. Due to the hydrophobicity of the cholesterol, such DNA nanostructures were generally easy to aggregate in aqueous solution. The addition of surfactants helped to avoid the aggregation and allowed the purification of the target structures from the aggregates.The researchers then separated the target DNA nanostructures from the aggregates by a gel electrophoresis. The separated DNA nanostructures were extracted from the gel.The scientists found that the surfactant type, amount, and added timing were important parameters for increasing final purification yield. Finally, Sato and Nomura confirmed that the purified structure retained the ability to bind lipid vesicle surface.The method developed by Sato and Nomura is based on a simple approach of adding surfactant under appropriate conditions. Therefore, this method can be combined with other conventional purification methods, not limited to the electrophoresis-based method.\"We believe that such purified hydrophobic DNA nanostructures will be useful for the construction of artificial cells and molecular robots that exhibit complex functions by using functionalized lipid membranes with DNA nanostructures,\" say Sato and Nomura.The research team will next work on implementing molecular communication function on molecular robots through selective molecular transport and connecting multiple lipid vesicles.

  "answer_squad": " long coherence times",
  "text": "Scientists are vigorously competing to transform the counterintuitive discoveries about the quantum realm from a century past into technologies of the future. The building block in these technologies is the quantum bit, or qubit. Several different kinds are under development, including ones that use defects within the symmetrical structures of diamond and silicon. They may one day transform computing, accelerate drug discovery, generate unhackable networks and more.          Working with researchers from several universities, scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory have discovered a method for introducing spinning electrons as qubits in a host nanomaterial. Their test results revealed record long coherence times\u2014the key property for any practical qubit because it defines the number of quantum operations that can be performed in the lifetime of the qubit.Electrons have a property analogous to the spin of a top, with a key difference. When tops spin in place, they can rotate to the right or left. Electrons can behave as though they were rotating in both directions at the same time. This is a quantum feature called superposition. Being in two states at the same time makes electrons good candidates for spin qubits.Spin qubits need a suitable material to house, control and detect them, as well as read out information in them. With that in mind, the team chose to investigate a nanomaterial that is made from carbon atoms only, has a hollow tubular shape and has thickness of only about one nanometer, or a billionth of a meter, roughly 100,000 times thinner than the width of a human hair.\"These carbon nanotubes are typically a few micrometers long,\" said Xuedan Ma. \"They are mostly free of fluctuating nuclear spins that would interfere with the spin of the electron and reduce its coherence time.\"Ma is a scientist in Argonne's Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM), a DOE Office of Science user facility. She also holds appointments at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago and Northwestern-Argonne Institute of Science and Engineering at Northwestern University.The problem the team faced is that carbon nanotubes by themselves cannot maintain a spinning electron at one site. It moves about the nanotube. Past researchers have inserted electrodes nanometers apart to confine a spinning electron between them. But this arrangement is bulky, expensive and challenging to scale up.The current team devised a way to eliminate the need for electrodes or other nanoscale devices for confining the electron. Instead, they chemically alter the atomic structure in a carbon nanotube in a way that traps a spinning electron to one location.\"Much to our gratification, our chemical modification method creates an incredibly stable spin qubit in a carbon nanotube,\" said chemist Jia-Shiang Chen. Chen is a member of both CNM and a postdoctoral scholar in the Center for Molecular Quantum Transduction at Northwestern University.The team's test results revealed record long coherence times compared to those of systems made by other means\u201410 microseconds.Given their small size, the team's spin qubit platform can be more easily integrated into quantum devices and permits many possible ways to read out the quantum information. Also, the carbon tubes are very flexible and their vibrations can be used to store information from the qubit.\"It is a long way from our spin qubit in a carbon nanotube to practical technologies, but this is a large early step in that direction,\" Ma said.The team's findings were reported in Nature Communications.

  "answer_squad": " trap-and-kill",
  "text": "National University of Singapore (NUS) pharmaceutical scientists have developed synthetic peptide nanonets for treating infections by bacteria strains resistant to last-resort antibiotics.          In nature, trap-and-kill is a common immune defense mechanism employed by various species, including humans. In response to the presence of pathogens, peptides are released from host cells and they promptly self-assemble in solution to form cross-linked nanonets, which then entrap the bacteria and render them more vulnerable to antimicrobial components.Several research groups have explored synthetic biomimetics of nanonets as an avenue for addressing the global healthcare challenge of widespread antibiotic resistance. However, most prominent studies in the field only yielded disjointed short nanofibrils restricted to the bacterial surfaces and are incapable of physically immobilizing the bacteria. Additionally, these designs were lacking in control over the initiation of the self-assembly process.A research team led by Associate Professor Rachel EE from the Department of Pharmacy, NUS has designed short \u03b2-hairpin peptides of 15 to 16 residues that are capable of self-assembling into nanonets selectively in response to lipopolysaccharide or lipoteichoic acid, which are integral membrane components unique to bacteria.                a) General structure and sequence of the \u03b2-hairpin peptides. Striated black lines between the side strands represent hydrogen bonds between the backbone amides. Sequences of the reverse turns are outlined to the right, with \u201cDP\u201d denoting D-Proline. Orange codes for the position replaced by Ala via Ala scanning. b) Proposed mechanistic pathways of bacteria-induced formation of peptide nanonets. As the peptide molecules in solution encounter LPS or LTA on the bacterial surface, amyloid nucleation is initiated. Amyloid fibrils undergo elongation as hairpin peptides stack at the tail-end of the fibril. Once the nanofibrils grow sufficiently long, they start to form physical cross-links. Eventually, a mature interlocking network of fibrils entraps other bacteria in the surroundings. Credit: Advanced Functional Materials (2022). DOI: 10.1002/adfm.202210858             This specificity towards bacteria is an appealing attribute not yet achieved in the field. The peptide nanonets displayed both trapping and antimicrobial killing functionalities, thus offering a direct upgrade from the trap-only nanonets in nature as well as synthetic designs reported in the field. This opens up opportunities for modulating the activity spectrum of the material.The team further demonstrated functional tunability of the peptides, where potency and fibrillation capacity could be modulated by changing only one or two amino acids at the hairpin turn region of the sequences. Of interest, the nanonets displayed robustness against enzymatic degradation by trypsin, which is a major challenge limiting clinical applications of simple antimicrobial peptides.Biological evaluations of the peptide nanonets using murine models showed significant antimicrobial efficacy against colistin-resistant bacteria and no systemic toxicity. This work was performed in collaboration with Associate Professor Rajamani Lakshminarayanan who holds joint appointments with the Department of Pharmacy, NUS and the Singapore Eye Research Institute. These findings were published in Advanced Functional Materials.Prof Ee said, \"Our peptide-based nanonets have shown potentials as an alternative anti-infective strategy to address antibiotic resistance. Our next challenge is to optimize the design for clinical application in humans.\"In an ongoing effort to fully elucidate the functions of the peptide nanonets, the team is investigating their potential in simultaneously subduing inflammatory responses, a common co-occurrence at the site of bacterial infection.

  "text": "Rice University materials scientist Boris Yakobson and collaborators uncovered a property of ferroelectric 2D materials that could be exploited as a feature in future devices.          Because they bend in response to an electrical stimulus, single-layer ferroelectric materials can be controlled to act as a nano-scale switch or even a motor, according to the study published in ACS Nano.Single-layer or 2D materials are typically made up of a single layer of atoms, meaning they are only a few nanometers thick. They have received significant attention in recent years due to their physical, electrical, chemical and optical properties, which makes them useful in applications ranging from consumer electronics to medical and industrial technologies.\"2D materials are very thin and very flexible,\" Yakobson said. \"In single-layer ferroelectrics, this produces an unexpected spontaneous, active bending behavior.\"\"The novelty we found in this study is that there is a connection or coupling between the ferroelectric state and the bending or flexing of the material. This work combines the discovery or prediction of a fundamental property of a class of 2D materials with a practical application angle.\"Ferroelectrics are materials made up of negative and positive ions that can shift to produce spontaneous polarization, meaning the ions segregate based on their electrical charge.\"The interesting thing is that the atoms are not identical,\" explains Jun-Jie Zhang, a Rice postdoctoral research associate and lead author on the study. \"Some of them are larger, and some are smaller, so the layer symmetry is broken.\"Polarization drives the larger atoms to one side of the 2D-material layer and the smaller atoms to the other side. This asymmetrical distribution of the atoms or ions causes the material surface to bend in ferroelectric state.\"So instead of remaining flat, in ferroelectric state the material will bend,\" Yakobson said. \"If you switch the polarization\u2014and you can switch it by applying electrical voltage\u2014you can control the direction in which it will bend. This controllable behavior means you have an actuator.\"An actuator is any device that translates a signal\u2014in many cases an electrical signal, but it can be a different kind of signal\u2014into mechanical displacement or, in other words, movement or work.\"The study looked at 2D indium phosphide (InP) as a representative of the class of ferroelectrics for which it predicts this property.\"This new property or flexing behavior has to be tested in a laboratory for specific substances,\" Yakobson said. \"Its most likely use will be as a type of switch. This behavior is very fast, very sensitive, which means that with a very tiny local signal you can maybe switch on a turbine or electrical engine, or control adaptive-optics telescopes' mirrors.

Although graphene electrons do not move at the speed of light, they exhibit the same energy-momentum relationship as photons and can be described as \"ultra-relativistic.\" When these electrons are confined in a quantum dot, they travel at high velocity in circular loops around the edge of the dot.\"These current loops create magnetic moments that are very sensitive to external magnetic fields,\" explained Jairo Velasco Jr., associate professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz. \"The sensitivity of these current loops stems from the fact that graphene electrons are ultra-relativistic and travel at high velocity.\"Velasco is a corresponding author of a paper on the new findings, published March 6 in Nature Nanotechnology. His group at UC Santa Cruz used a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to create the quantum dots in graphene and study their properties. His collaborators on the project include scientists at the University of Manchester, U.K., and the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan.\"This was highly collaborative work,\" Velasco said. \"We did the measurements in my lab at UCSC, and then we worked very closely with theoretical physicists at the University of Manchester to understand and interpret our data.\"The unique optical and electrical properties of quantum dots\u2014which are often made of semiconductor nanocrystals\u2014are due to electrons being confined within a nanoscale structure such that their behavior is governed by quantum mechanics. Because the resulting electronic structure is like that of atoms, quantum dots are often called \"artificial atoms.\" Velasco's approach creates quantum dots in different forms of graphene using an electrostatic \"corral\" to confine graphene's speeding electrons.\"Part of what makes this interesting is the fundamental physics of this system and the opportunity to study atomic physics in the ultra-relativistic regime,\" he said. \"At the same time, there are interesting potential applications for this as a new type of quantum sensor that can detect magnetic fields at the nano scale with high spatial resolution.\"Additional applications are also possible, according to co-first author Zhehao Ge, a UCSC graduate student in physics. \"The findings in our work also indicate that graphene quantum dots can potentially host a giant persistent current (a perpetual electric current without the need of an external power source) in a small magnetic field,\" Ge said. \"Such current can potentially be used for quantum simulation and quantum computation.\"The study looked at quantum dots in both monolayer graphene and twisted bilayer graphene. The graphene rests on an insulating layer of hexagonal boron nitride, and a voltage applied with the STM tip creates charges in the boron nitride that serve to electrostatically confine electrons in the graphene.Although Velasco's lab uses STM to create and study graphene quantum dots, a simpler system using metal electrodes in a cross-bar array could be used in a magnetic sensor device. Because graphene is highly flexible, the sensor could be integrated with flexible substrates to enable magnetic field sensing of curved objects.\"You could have many quantum dots in an array, and this could be used to measure magnetic fields in living organisms, or to understand how the magnetic field is distributed in a material or a device,\" Velasco said.

  "answer_squad": " nucleosomes",
  "text": "In organisms whose cells have a nucleus, like plants and animals, the basic packaging units of DNA are the so-called nucleosomes. A nucleosome consists of a segment of DNA wound around eight proteins known as histones. Gene expression, which lies at the basis of protein production, requires \"reading\" DNA, for which DNA needs to be temporarily unwrapped. Detailed studies, and especially visualizations, of DNA\u2013histone and nucleosome dynamics are crucial for a better understanding of DNA unwrapping and related processes.       Mikihiro Shibata from Kanazawa University and colleagues have now succeeded in making video recordings of the nucleosome dynamics of H2A.Z, a histone variant associated with various biological processes. The videos reveal the spontaneous sliding of H2A.Z nucleosomes on a substrate. The work is published in the journal Nano Letters.Histone variants, such as H2A.Z, differ from the canonical forms (like H2A) encountered in stable nucleosome packaging. They form unstable nucleosomes with particular biological functions; H2A.Z is believed to play a role in early embryonic development and stem cell differentiation. The dynamics of the H2A.Z nucleosome under physiological conditions are mostly unknown. Shibata and colleagues used high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) to investigate H2A.Z nucleosome dynamics, as the method is a powerful nanoimaging tool for visualizing molecular structures and their dynamics at high spatiotemporal resolution.HS-AFM videos of three representative H2A nucleosomes on a C2P[5]A+-modified mica surface. Credit: Nano Letters (2023). DOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.2c04346To observe DNA\u2013histone dynamics in HS-AFM experiments, the nucleosome needs to be put onto a substrate. The DNA should adsorb easily to the substrate, but at the same time, substrate\u2013DNA interactions should still be weak enough to avoid suppressing dynamical processes. The scientists therefore prepared substrates by putting pillar[5]arenes onto a mica surface. The pillar[5]arenes, molecules with a pentagonal tubular structure, form a thin film on the mica and provide the ideal surface for nucleosome dynamics observations.The researchers looked at the time evolution of a system consisting of a nucleosome particle put on a DNA strand. Experiments with canonical H2A histones confirmed the stability of H2A nucleosomes: no significant changes over time were observed. Observations for H2A.Z histone variants showed a different picture, however. HS-AFM with a time resolution of 0.3 s revealed sliding events, in which a nucleosome particle slides along the DNA strand.The findings of Shibata and colleagues may lead to a better understanding of the biochemical mechanisms behind gene expression. \"The single-molecule imaging by HS-AFM presented here could help unveil the relationship between nucleosome dynamics and gene regulation \u2026 in the near future,\" say the researchers.      High-speed atomic force microscopyThe general principle of atomic force microscopy (AFM) is to make a very small tip scan of the surface of a sample. During this horizontal (xy) scan, the tip, which is attached to a small cantilever, follows the sample's vertical (z) profile, inducing a force on the cantilever that can be measured. The magnitude of the force at the xy position can be related to the z value; the xyz data generated during a scan then result in a height map providing structural information about the investigated sample.In high-speed-AFM (HS-AFM), the working principle is slightly more involved: the cantilever is made to oscillate near its resonance frequency. When the tip is moved across a surface, the variations in the amplitude (or the frequency) of the cantilever's oscillation\u2014resulting from the tip's interaction with the sample's surface\u2014are recorded, as these provide a measure for the local \"z\" value. AFM does not involve lenses, so its resolution is not restricted by the so-called diffraction limit as in X-ray diffraction, for example.HS-AFM results in a video, where the time interval between frames depends on the speed with which a single image can be generated (by xy-scanning the sample). Researchers at Kanazawa University have in recent years developed HS-AFM further, so that it can be applied to study biochemical molecules and biomolecular processes in real-time. Mikihiro Shibata and colleagues have now applied the method to study nucleosome dynamics, revealing a sliding process of nucleosome particles along a DNA strand.

  "text": "Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University have successfully threaded atoms of indium metal in between individual fibers in bundles of transition metal chalcogenide nanofibers. By steeping the bundles in indium gas, rows of atoms were able to make their way in between the fibers to create a unique nanostructure via intercalation. Through simulations and resistivity measurements, individual bundles were shown to have metallic properties, paving the way for application as flexible nanowires in nanocircuitry. The paper is published in the journal ACS Nano.          Atomic wires of transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) are nanostructures consisting of a transition metal and a group 16 element like sulfur, selenium, and tellurium. They are able to self-assemble into a wide range of structures with different dimensionality, putting them at the heart of a revolution in nanomaterials that has been the focus of intense research in recent years. In particular, a class of 3D TMC structures have garnered particular interest, consisting of bundles of TMC nanofibers held together by metallic atoms in between the fibers, all forming a well-ordered lattice in its cross section. Depending on the choice of metal, the structure could even be made to become a superconductor.Furthermore, by making the bundles thin, they could be made into flexible structures that conduct electricity: this makes TMC nanostructures a prime candidate for use as wiring in nanocircuitry. However, it has been difficult to make these structures into the long, thin fibers that are required to study them in depth, as well as for nanotechnology applications.A team led by Assistant Professor Yusuke Nakanishi and Associate Professor Yasumitsu Miyata has been studying synthesis techniques for TMC nanostructures. In recent work, they showed that they could produce long, thin bundles of TMCs (with no metal) over unprecedentedly large length scales. Now, they have used a vapor phase reaction to thread atomically-thin rows of indium into thin bundles of tungsten telluride. By exposing their long nanofiber bundles to indium vapor under vacuum at 500 degrees Celsius, the indium metal atoms made their way into the space between the individual nanofibers that make up the bundles, forming an intercalating (or bridging) row of indium that binds the fibers together.                (a) Schematic of atomic structure of both tungsten telluride nanofiber bundles and the final intercalated structure, along with scanning transmission electron microscopy images. (b) Synthesized 3D TMC nanofibers on a silicon substrate. Credit: Tokyo Metropolitan University             Having successfully produced large amounts of these threaded TMC bundles, they proceeded to study the properties of their new nanowires. By looking at the resistivity as a function of temperature, they showed conclusively that individual bundles behave like a metal and thus conduct electricity. This agreed with computer simulations, and also demonstrated how well-ordered the structures were. Interestingly, they found that this structure was slightly different to bulk batches of bundled nanofibers, in that the intercalated rows caused each nanofiber to rotate slightly about its axis.The team's technique is not only limited to indium and tungsten telluride, nor to this particular structure. They hope their work might inspire a new chapter for nanomaterial development and the study of their unique properties.

  "text": "Cell membranes are barriers that maintain cellular homeostasis, and the intracellular delivery of biologically functional molecules, including peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids to manipulate cellular functions. Conventional intracellular uptake processes require high concentrations of biofunctional molecules with low permeability to pass through the cell membrane.          This results in low drug activity because the probability of the biofunctional molecules entering target cells and their organelles is low. In addition, many drugs damage healthy cells as well as the cells that are supposed to be targeted due to poor selectivity, making it necessary to develop technology that can increase drugs' selectivity so that they enter targeted cells with high efficiency.A research group led by Professor Ikuhiko Nakase (Assistant Director) and Professor Takuya Iida (Director) of the Research Institute for Light-induced Acceleration System (RILACS) at Osaka Metropolitan University used light-induced convection with the aid of superradiance to achieve enhanced permeability of the cell membrane, by locally concentrating biofunctional molecules, including cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). The light-induced system was capable of effective drug delivery, even at concentrations as low as 1 pmol/L.To induce photothermal assembly around live cells in a cell culture medium, an infrared laser using a 10x objective was focused for one-hundred seconds on the bottom of a glass dish densely coated with gold nanoparticles; the laser's wavelength is hardly absorbed by living organisms and does not cause damage but can generate heat and a photothermal flow. Molecules were concentrated near a bubble generated by the laser heat, which was located approximately 100 \u00b5m away from the target cells on the substrate.Using this system, the group found that around the laser irradiation point, mitochondrial structures near the photo-induced bubbles were efficiently stained even at a concentration 0.1% of that of conventional methods. Furthermore, the light-induced acceleration succeeded in inducing apoptosis using CPPs at a concentration of 1% of that of conventional methods, resulting in extremely efficient and selective cellular uptake that resulted in the destruction of targeted cancer cells.\"Developing technologies that can selectively introduce biofunctional molecules into targeted cells is important, not only for basic research but also in clinical practice. We expect these results will significantly reduce the concentration of drugs needed to perform cell testing. Because new drugs are often expensive to manufacture, this will lower costs\u2014and speed up drug discovery. Furthermore, we will apply these results to medical technologies that can contribute to cancer diagnosis and treatment and strive to make this technology useable in human healthcare,\" concluded Professor Nakase and Professor Iida in a joint statement.The findings are published in the journal Nano Letters.

  "text": "The animal brain consists of tens of billions of neurons or nerve cells that perform complex tasks like processing emotions, learning, and making judgments by communicating with each other via neurotransmitters. These small signaling molecules diffuse\u2014move from high to low concentration regions\u2014between neurons, acting as chemical messengers.          Scientists believe that this diffusive motion might be at the heart of the brain's superior function. Therefore, they have aimed to understand the role of specific neurotransmitters by detecting their release in the brain using amperometric and microdialysis methods. However, these methods provide insufficient information, necessitating better sensing techniques.To this end, scientists developed an optical imaging method wherein protein probes change their fluorescence intensity upon detecting a specific neurotransmitter. Recently, a group of researchers from Shibaura Institute of Technology in Japan led by Professor Yasuo Yoshimi has taken this idea forward. They have successfully synthesized fluorescent molecularly imprinted polymeric nanoparticles (fMIP-NPs) that serve as probes to detect specific neurotransmitters\u2013serotonin, dopamine, and acetylcholine.Notably, developing such probes has been considered difficult so far. Their work, published in Nanomaterials, involves contributions from Mr. Yuto Katsumata, Mr. Naoya Osawa, Mr. Neo Ogishita, and Mr.Ryota Kadoya.Prof. Yoshimi briefly explains the fundamentals of fMIP-NP synthesis: \"It involves multiple steps. First, the target neurotransmitter to be detected is fixed on a glass beads surface. Next, monomers (building blocks of polymers) with different functions\u2014detection, cross-linking, and fluorescence\u2014polymerize around the beads, enveloping the neurotransmitter. The resulting polymer is then washed out to obtain a nanoparticle with the neurotransmitter structure imprinted as a cavity. It will fit only the target neurotransmitter, just like only a particular key can open a lock. Hence, fMIP-NPs can detect their corresponding neurotransmitters in the brain.\"When the target neurotransmitters fit inside the cavity, the fMIP-NPs swell and get bigger. The researchers suggest that this increases the distance between the fluorescent monomers that, in turn, reduces their interactions, including self-quenching that suppresses fluorescence, with each other. As a result, the fluorescence intensity is enhanced, indicating the presence of the neurotransmitters.The researchers improved their selectivity of the detection by adjusting the neurotransmitter density on the surface of the glass beads during fMIP-NP synthesis.Additionally, the choice of material for fixing the neurotransmitters was found to play a crucial role in the detection specificity. The researchers found that blended silane is better than pure silane for attaching the neurotransmitters, serotonin and dopamine, to the glass bead surface. The fMIP-NPs synthesized using blended silane specifically detected serotonin and dopamine.In contrast, those synthesized using pure silane resulted in non-specific fMIP-NPs that responded to non-target neurotransmitters, identifying them incorrectly as serotonin and dopamine. Likewise, poly([2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] trimethylammonium chloride (METMAC)-co-methacrylamide) but not METMAC homopolymer was found to be an effective dummy template of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. While the former produced fMIP-NPs that selectively detected acetylcholine, the latter led to unresponsive nanoparticles.These results demonstrate the feasibility of fMIP-NPs in the selective detection of neurotransmitters released in our brain. \"Imaging the brain with this new technique could reveal the relationship between neurotransmitter diffusion and brain activity. This, in turn, can help us treat neurological diseases and even create advanced computers that mimics human brain functions,\" said Professor Yoshimi.

  "text": "X-ray diffraction has been used for more than a hundred years to understand the structure of crystals or proteins\u2014for instance, in 1952 the well-known double helix structure of the DNA that carries genetic information was discovered in this way. In this technique, the object under investigation is bombarded with short-wavelength X-ray beams. The diffracted beams then interfere and thus create characteristic diffraction patterns from which one can gain information about the shape of the object.          For several years now it has been possible to study even single nanoparticles in this way, using very short and extremely intense X-ray pulses. However, this typically only yields a two-dimensional image of the particle. A team of researchers led by ETH professor Daniela Rupp, together with colleagues at the universities of Rostock and Freiburg, the TU Berlin and DESY in Hamburg, have now found a way to also calculate the three-dimensional structure from a single diffraction pattern, so that one can \"look\" at the particle from all directions. In the future it should even be possible to make 3D-movies of the dynamics of nanostructures in this way. The results of this research have recently been published in the scientific journal Science Advances.Daniela Rupp has been assistant professor at ETH Zurich since 2019, where she leads the research group \"Nanostructures and ultra-fast X-ray science.\" Together with her team she tries to better understand the interaction between very intense X-ray pulses and matter. As a model system they use nanoparticles, which they also investigate at the Paul Scherrer Institute. \"For the future there are great opportunities at the new Maloja instrument, on which we were the first user group to make measurements at the beginning of last year. Right now our team there is activating the attosecond mode, with which we can even observe the dynamics of electrons,\" says Rupp.A deeper view into dynamical processesThe recently published work is an important step toward that future, as postdoctoral researcher Alessandro Colombo explains, \"With this work, we open a window on studies of dynamical processes of the extremely small particles in the femtosecond regime.\" The problem with X-ray diffraction using very intense pulses is that the objects under investigation evaporate immediately after the bombardment\u2014\"diffract and destroy\" in the researchers' jargon.Since this means that only a single snapshot of the nanoparticle can be made, of course one would like to obtain as much information as possible from it. To compute more than a 2D image from the diffraction pattern, up to now one had to impose on the computer algorithm some strongly limiting assumptions on the shape of the nanoparticle, for instance its symmetry. However, in this way any fine detail of the particle that deviates from those assumptions remains hidden. Moreover, with those algorithms many adjustments had to be made by hand.      Improved algorithm\"This is where our new method comes in,\" says Rupp. \"With our new algorithm, which uses a very efficient simulation method and a clever optimization strategy, we can automatically produce 3D images of the nanoparticle without having to impose specific requirements. This allows us to see even tiny irregularities, which can arise from the growth process of the particle.\"To achieve 3D resolution, the researchers at ETH do not just use that part of the diffraction pattern which is diffracted by a small angle of a few degrees, as has been customary up to now, but also the wide-angle part of 30 degrees or more. This means, of course, that the amount of information to be retrieved increases enormously, but the improved algorithm can cope even with that.In this way, from the diffraction patterns of single silver nanoparticles 70 nanometers in size that are bombarded with X-ray pulses lasting around 100 femtoseconds, Rupp's team can now calculate 3D pictures that show the particles from different angles.Snapshots in free flight\"Up to now we were missing that third dimension,\" says Rupp,\"but now we can investigate many processes either for the first time or with unprecedented precision, for instance, how nanoparticles melt in a few picoseconds or how nanorods accumulate to form larger objects. \" The crucial point is that the snapshots can be taken in free flight in vacuum, without having to fix the nanoparticles on a surface, as is done in electron microscopy.Moreover, many kinds of particles cannot even be put on a surface because they are too fragile or short-lived. But even those samples that can be studied with an electron microscope are considerably influenced by their interaction with the surface. In free flight, on the other hand, melting or aggregation processes can be studied without any disturbance.

  "text": "Gene therapy is a potential mode of treatment for a wide variety of diseases caused by genetic mutations. While it has been an area of diverse and intense research, historically, only a very few patients have been treated using gene therapy\u2014and fewer still cured. The advent of the genetic modification technique called CRISPR-Cas9 in 2012 has revolutionized gene therapy\u2014as well as biology as a whole\u2014and it has recently entered clinical trials for the treatment of some diseases in humans.       Haruno Onuma, Yusuke Sato and Hideyoshi Harashima at Hokkaido University have developed a new delivery system for CRISPR-Cas9, based on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), that could greatly increases the efficiency of in vivo gene therapy. Their findings were published in the Journal of Controlled Release.\"There are broadly two ways of treating diseases with gene therapy,\" Sato explained, \"ex vivo, where cells are subjected to the desired modifications in the laboratory and then introduced into the patient, and in vivo, where the treatment is administered to the patient to change the cells in their body. Safe and effective in vivo treatment is the ultimate aspiration of gene therapy, as it would be a straightforward process for patients and healthcare providers. LNPs can function as a vehicle for the safe and effective delivery of such therapies.\"                The RNP-ssODN is designed to ensure the CRISPR-Cas9 molecule is encapsulated by the LNP. Once inside the cells, the ssODN dissociates and CRISPR-Cas9 can carry out its effect. Credit: Journal of Controlled Release (2023).

The guide RNA binds to a specific, complementary DNA sequence, and the Cas9 protein cuts that sequence, allowing it to be modified. The guide RNA can be altered to target specific DNA sequences to be modified.\"In a previous study, we discovered that additional DNA molecules, called ssODNs, ensure that the CRISPR-Cas9 molecule is loaded into the LNPs (CRISPR-LNPs),\" Harashima elucidated. \"In this study, we again used ssODNs, but they were carefully designed so that they would not inhibit the function of the guide RNA.\"Using a guide RNA targeting the expression of a protein called transthyretin, they evaluated the effectiveness of the CRISPR-LNPs in mice models. CRISPR-LNPs with ssODNs that dissociated from the guide RNA at room temperature were most effective at reducing serum transthyretin: two consecutive doses, one day apart, reduced it by 80%.\"We have demonstrated the optimal ssODN sequence affinity that ensures the loading and the release of CRISPR-Cas9 at the target location; and that this system can be used to edit cells in vivo,\" concluded Onuma. \"We will continue to improve the design of ssODNs, as well as to develop optimal lipid formulations to increase the effectiveness of delivery.\" More information:Haruno Onuma et al, Lipid nanoparticle-based ribonucleoprotein delivery for in vivo genome editing, Journal of Controlled Release (2023).

It's like the genetic and proteomic code scribbled in light.\"Dionne is senior author of a new study in the journal Nano Letters detailing an innovative method her team has developed that could lead to faster (almost immediate), inexpensive, and more accurate microbial assays of virtually any fluid one might want to test for microbes.Traditional culturing methods still in use today can take hours if not days to complete. A tuberculosis culture takes 40 days, Dionne said. The new test can be done in minutes and holds the promise of better and faster diagnoses of infection, improved use of antibiotics, safer foods, enhanced environmental monitoring, and faster drug development, says the team.Old dogs, new tricksThe breakthrough is not that bacteria display these spectral fingerprints, a fact that has been known for decades, but in how the team has been able to reveal those spectra amid the blinding array of light reflecting from each sample.\"Not only does each type of bacterium demonstrate unique patterns of light but virtually every other molecule or cell in a given sample does too,\" said first author Fareeha Safir, a Ph.D. student in Dionne's lab. \"Red blood cells, white blood cells, and other components in the sample are sending back their own signals, making it hard if not impossible to distinguish the microbial patterns from the noise of other cells.\"A milliliter of blood\u2014about the size of a raindrop\u2014can contain billions of cells, only a few of which might be microbes. The team had to find a way to separate and amplify the light reflecting from the bacteria alone. To do that, they ventured along several surprising scientific tangents, combining a four-decade-old technology borrowed from computing\u2014the inkjet printer\u2014and two cutting-edge technologies of our time\u2014nanoparticles and artificial intelligence.      \"The key to separating bacterial spectra from other signals is to isolate the cells in extremely small samples.

To circumvent challenges in handling biological samples, the researchers modified the printer to put samples to paper using acoustic pulses. Each dot of printed blood is then just two trillionths of a liter in volume\u2014more than a billion times smaller than a raindrop. At that scale, the droplets are so small they may hold just a few dozen cells.In addition, the researchers infused the samples with gold nanorods that attach themselves to bacteria, if present, and act like antennas, drawing the laser light toward the bacteria and amplifying the signal some 1500 times its unenhanced strength. Appropriately isolated and amplified, the bacterial spectra stick out like scientific sore thumbs.The final piece of the puzzle is the use of machine learning to compare the several spectra reflecting from each printed dot of fluid to spot the telltale signatures of any bacteria in the sample.\"It's an innovative solution with the potential for life-saving impact. We are now excited for commercialization opportunities that can help redefine the standard of bacterial detection and single-cell characterization,\" said senior co-author Amr Saleh, a former postdoctoral scholar in Dionne's lab and now a professor at Cairo University.While this technique was created and perfected using samples of blood, Dionne is equally confident that it can be applied to other sorts of fluids and target cells beyond bacteria, like testing drinking water for purity or perhaps spotting viruses faster, more accurately, and at lower cost than present methods.

  "text": "In a recent study, researchers from the Department of Organic Chemistry (OC) and Materials Research Centre (MRC), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), show that surface modifications of two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide (2D-MoS2) nanosheets can make them highly effective for applications like delivering drugs to diseased cells.          Nanomaterials usually need to be modified or customized depending on the application to improve their efficiency. Typically, they are chemically modified through a process called functionalization, which involves attaching ligands (small or large molecules) to the surface of the nanomaterial.In the new study, the researchers modified the surface of 2D-MoS2 nanosheets with thiol (sulfur-containing) ligands. They found that these thiols can be exchanged with naturally-occurring thiols in biological systems, which could allow drugs attached to these nanosheets to be released. These chemically-modified nanosheets were also found to be safe to use inside living cells.\"Our study shows that thiol exchange on 2D-MoS2 nanosheets is effective, and the nanomaterial is stable in the presence of various biomolecules. This is an important observation as it will make this nanomaterial highly beneficial for biomedical applications like drug delivery,\" explains Mrinmoy De, Associate Professor at the Department of Organic Chemistry and senior author of the study published in ACS Nano.The team first used a fluorescent thiol called boron-dipyrromethene (BOD-SH) to modify the surface of the 2D-MoS2 nanosheets in order to create a functionalized version (BOD-MoS2). Then, they tested the possibility of thiol-to-thiol exchange on BOD-MoS2 using glutathione (GSH)\u2014a naturally occurring thiol found in abundance in cancer cells. They found that GSH molecules swapped places with BOD-SH on the surface of the nanosheet\u2014a process that they confirmed using fluorescence techniques.When the researchers attached an anti-cancer drug named doxorubicin (DOX) to the nanosheet surface, they found that thiol exchange could also happen between GSH and DOX, allowing DOX to get dropped off at the diseased site. Because the exchange happens only in the presence of high concentrations of GSH found in diseased cells, drugs like DOX can be delivered specifically to cancer cells without affecting normal cells, which can also potentially reduce any side effects.Previous efforts have focused on using gold nanoparticles for such biomedical applications, according to the researchers, but these nanoparticles are expensive and have limited efficiency due to their non-selectivity between mono thiols and disulfides.\"Our experiments show that 2D-MoS2 nanosheets can be an effective substitute for gold nanoparticles, and they will be greatly beneficial in the field of nanomedicine,\" says Pradipta Behera, a postdoctoral research scholar at IISc and the first author of the study. The MoS2 nanosheets were found to be stable in the presence of biofluids. They also have a higher surface area than gold nanoparticles, which means that they can be more efficient.Moving forward, the team plans to work on improving the stability of the nanomaterial in the presence of various thiol-containing liquids and exploring alternative surface modification approaches to customize the nanosheets for other applications. \"This work on 2D-MoS2 nanosheets can be developed in the future as an alternative to RNA and DNA delivery applications, which can be useful for detecting and treating infections such as COVID-19,\" adds Behera.

  "text": "Mount Sinai Health System and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center researchers have developed a new drug delivery approach that uses nanoparticles to enable more effective and targeted delivery of anti-cancer drugs to treat brain tumors in children.          The technology allows for the enhanced delivery of anti-cancer drugs to the specific locations of brain tumors while sparing normal brain regions. The result is improved effectiveness and reduced toxicities of anti-cancer drugs, according to their study, published March 2, 2023, in Nature Materials.\"We show that we can more successfully deliver lower doses of the drug in a more effective manner to the specific sites of tumor within the brain, while sparing the bone toxicity that is seen in younger patients,\" says Praveen Raju, MD, Ph.D., Co-Director of the Children's Brain and Spinal Tumor Center at Mount Sinai Kravis Children's Hospital, and senior author of the study.Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor, accounting for about 20% of all brain tumors in children. It is highly aggressive and difficult to treat, and is considered incurable in nearly 30% of patients. Even children who are \"cured\" experience severe long-term disabilities and health issues, primarily due to the adverse side effects of radiation and chemotherapy. Site-directed drug delivery to the affected brain tissue is hindered by a distinct and highly regulated blood-brain barrier, which normally protects the brain from infections or other harmful substances.In this study, the researchers made use of a normal mechanism that the immune system uses to traffic white blood cells to sites of infection, inflammation, or tissue injury. Rather than randomly sending immune cells throughout the body, there is a homing mechanism on activated blood vessels that immune cells use to go where they are needed. The researchers used this unique homing feature, which is also found within brain tumor blood vessels, to target their drug-loaded nanoparticles to the site of the disease and not the normal brain regions.Using the new drug delivery platform in a genetically relevant mouse model of medulloblastoma, the research team was able to enhance the efficacy of an anti-cancer drug that could potentially be useful for a subset of medulloblastoma patients, but which is currently limited by the bone toxicity it secondarily creates in children.\"In addition, we showed that this targeted drug delivery approach is further enhanced with very-low-dose radiation, which is a standard therapy already used for most children and adults with primary and metastatic brain tumors,\" says Dr. Raju, Associate Professor of Neurology, Neuroscience, and Pediatrics at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.\"Importantly, our blood-brain barrier drug delivery approach has the potential to improve the delivery of drugs for other pediatric brain tumors and localized diseases in the brain in both children and adults, including focal epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and possibly neurodegenerative disorders.\"\"Certain proteins appear on blood vessels at sites of inflammation that help white blood cells exit the bloodstream. They work like police officers at the site of a car accident, who let in emergency personnel to help,\" says Daniel Heller, Ph.D., Head of the Cancer Nanomedicine Laboratory and Member in the Molecular Pharmacology Program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and senior author on the study. \"We sent in our own emergency personnel, in the form of drug-loaded nanoparticles, composed of certain sugar molecules that can target these same proteins.\"The researchers anticipate that continued investigation and development of this method to harness and improve the transport of materials across the blood-brain barrier and other sites will be instrumental for improving the efficacy of several classes of approved and experimental therapeutics. This drug delivery platform can be used to treat cancers in the brain and other sites of the body, as well as other inflammation-related diseases in the central nervous system and elsewhere.

  "question_squad": " What is the name of the method that enables fabrication of multi-walled CNTs?",
  "answer_squad": " TF",
  "text": "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are cylindrical tube-like structures made of carbon atoms that display highly desirable physical properties like high strength, low weight, and excellent thermal and electrical conductivities. This makes them ideal materials for various applications, including reinforcement materials, energy storage and conversion devices, and electronics.          Despite such immense potential, however, there have been challenges in commercializing CNTs, such as their incorporation on plastic substrates for fabricating flexible CNT-based devices. Traditional fabrication methods require carefully controlled environments such as high temperatures and a clean room. Further, they require repeat transfers to produce CNTs with different resistance values.More direct methods such as laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) and thermal fusion (TF) have been developed as alternatives. In the LIFT method, a laser is used to directly transfer CNTs onto substrates, while in TF, CNTs are mixed with polymers that are then selectively removed by a laser to form CNT wires with varying resistance values.However, both these methods are expensive and have their unique problems. LIFT requires expensive pulsed lasers and preparation of CNTs with specific resistance values, while TF uses large amounts of CNTs that are not utilized and go to waste.Aiming to develop a more simple and inexpensive approach, Associate Professor Dr. Takashi Ikuno along with his collaborators, Mr. Hiroaki Komatsu, Mr. Yosuke Sugita and Mr. Takahiro Matsunami at Tokyo University of Science, Japan, recently proposed a novel method that enables fabrication of multi-walled CNT (MWNT) wiring on a plastic film under ambient conditions (room temperature and atmospheric pressure) using a low-cost laser.The breakthrough, published in the journal Scientific Reports, involves coating a polypropylene (PP) film with an MWNT film about 10 \u03bcm thick and then exposing it to a mW UV laser. The result is a conductive wiring made of a combination of MWNT and PP.\"This process enables the easy 'drawing' of wiring and flexible devices for wearable sensors without the need for complex processes,\" says Dr. Ikuno.The researchers attributed the formation of these wires to the difference in the thermal conductivities between the MWNT and the PP film. As the MWNT/PP film is exposed to the laser, the high thermal conductivity of the MWNT layer causes the heat to spread along the length of the wire, resulting in high temperatures at the MWNT\u2013PP interface and lower temperatures elsewhere in the PP film.      Directly below the laser, where temperatures are the highest, the PP diffuses into the MWNT film to form a thick PP/MWNT composite, while a thin PP/MWNT layer is formed at the edges of the laser where temperatures are relatively low.The proposed method also allows the fabrication of carbon wires with different resistance values within the same process (without repeat transfer) by simply changing the irradiation conditions, thereby eliminating the need for additional steps. Exposing the PP/MWNT film to high laser energies, achieved either by low scanning speeds, a high number of laser exposures, or the use of a high-powered laser, produces thicker wires with a higher concentration of MWNTs.Consequently, the lower resistivity of MWNT and the thicker wire lowers the resistance per unit length of the wire (resistance is directly proportional to the ratio between the resistivity and the thickness of the wire).By precisely controlling the exposure of the MWNT/PP film to laser light, the researchers successfully fabricated MWNT wires with a wide range of resistance values, from 0.789 k\u03a9/cm to 114 k\u03a9/cm. Moreover, these wires were highly flexible and maintained their resistance even when bent repeatedly.Additionally, the method solved one of the pressing issues with current techniques, namely the inability of LIFT and TF techniques to reuse CNTs not utilized in the fabrication process. In the proposed method, MWNTs not incorporated into the PP film during laser irradiation can be recovered and reused, allowing for the creation of new MWNT wires with little to no change in resistance values.With its simplicity, efficient utilization of CNTs, and the capability to create high-quality wires, the new method has the potential to realize large-scale manufacturing of flexible carbon wiring for flexible sensors and energy conversion and storage devices.\"We expect the process cost to be significantly reduced compared to that for conventional methods. This, in turn, will contribute to the realization of low-cost flexible sensors that are expected to have wide applications in large quantities,\" concludes Dr. Ikuno.

  "text": "Decisions on cancer treatment could become better tailored to individual patients with the adoption of a new imaging method being developed by University of Michigan researchers that maps the chemical makeup of a patient's tumor.          Today, treatment methods for cancer\u2014whether surgery, radiation therapy or immunotherapy\u2014are recommended based mainly on the tumor's location, size and aggressiveness. This information is usually obtained by anatomical imaging\u2014MRI or CT scans or ultrasound and by biological assays performed in tissues obtained by tumor biopsies.Yet, the chemical environment of a tumor has a significant effect on how effective a particular treatment may be. For example, a low oxygen level in the tumor tissue impairs the effectiveness of radiation therapy.Now, a team of scientists from the University of Michigan and two universities in Italy has demonstrated that an imaging system that uses special nanoparticles can provide a real-time, high-resolution chemical map that shows the distribution of chemicals of interest in a tumor.It could lead to a way to help clinicians make better recommendations on cancer therapy tailored to a particular patient\u2014precision medicine.Their research, published in ACS Nano, reports on the first demonstration of an in vivo chemical imaging method generalizable to any chemical of interest, according to U-M chemistry professor Raoul Kopelman, one of the senior authors on the paper.The researchers used a method for \"chemical imaging\" of tissues called photo-acoustic chemical imaging, or PACI.\"The novelty of this method is that it is performed in vivo, directly inside the body,\" Kopelman said.The team tested their system in mice that were implanted with tissue from a biopsy of a patient's tumor, called a xenograft. Patient-derived xenografts recapitulate the genetic and biological characteristics of the patient's tumor.PACI employs nanoparticles that have been developed in the past decades, by Kopelman and others, that can be injected into the mouse to target the tumor and sense a particular chemical of biomedical interest, such as oxygen, sodium or potassium.When this nanosensor is activated by infrared laser light that is able to penetrate into the tumor tissues, an ultrasound signal is generated that can be used to map the concentration and distribution of that particular chemical.The PACI method could be used in a mouse xenograft to repeatedly follow the characteristics of a particular patient's tumor to evaluate the chemical environment of the tumor over time.\"This would allow for optimization of treatment methods for a particular patient\u2014precision medicine,\" Kopelman said.Kopelman and colleagues employed the PACI with a nanoparticle targeted to sense oxygen. Following radiation therapy of the tumor in the mouse, the researchers found a significant correlation between oxygen levels in each part of the tumor and how well radiation therapy destroyed tumor tissue\u2014the lower the local oxygen in the tissue, the lower the local radiation therapy efficacy.\"We thus provide a simple, noninvasive, and inexpensive method to both predict the efficacy of radiation therapy for a given tumor and identify treatment-resistant regions within the tumor's microenvironment,\" Kopelman said.\"Such chemical mapping would help the clinical team prescribe a personalized, optimal treatment for a given patient's tumor, based on the new diagnostics from the tumor xenograft's chemical mapping.\"In this research, PACI has been employed in patient-derived xenografts. The ultimate goal would be the ability to make the chemical maps in patients directly.That would be feasible, says Kopelman, with fiber optics that could be threaded through the patient's venous system, as is done in cardiac procedures, to get near the tumor. The nanosensor could then be activated by the laser, but it requires nanosensors developed for each chemical of interest, and each nanosensor would need to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

  "text": "The imbalance between dietary intake and output that results from metabolic disorders like obesity disrupts energy homeostasis. Despite significant advances in understanding the pathogenesis of these metabolic disorders, the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes continues to rise and remains an unmet medical challenge.          The central nervous system (CNS) tightly modulates the physiological control of energy balance, having the hypothalamus as the focal area. Substantial evidence points to the hypothalamus's lipid metabolism as a critical nutrient status signal influencing feeding behavior and peripheral metabolism. Remarkably, the accumulation of fatty acids (FAs) or their metabolites in hypothalamic neurons serves as a satiety signal and may reduce food intake and hepatic function.The mitochondrial enzyme carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1A (CPT1A), which facilitates the entrance of long-chain FAs for \u03b2-oxidation, is a critical target in brain lipid metabolism that regulates energy balance. Since CPT1A is highly expressed in central and peripheral tissues, its regulatory potential in the energy balance is based on two different interventions. In peripheral tissues (i.e., liver and adipose tissue), overexpression of CPT1A and induction of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) ameliorates insulin resistance and prevents body weight gain. Contrarily, in the CNS, CPT1A inhibition reduces food intake and body weight. Thus, specific inhibition of CPT1A in the hypothalamus but not in peripheral tissues offers a prospective treatment option for metabolic diseases that are characterized by an imbalance in energy homeostasis.Researchers in a multi-institutional collaboration report that an inventively crosslinked polymeric micelle-type nanomedicine platform stably encapsulating the CPT1A inhibitor C75-CoA targets brain lipid metabolism to attenuate food intake and peripheral metabolism in mice. Several researchers from the University of Barcelona (Barcelona, Spain) also participated in this project. The work is published in the journal Biomaterials Science.C75 is a well-known CPT1A inhibitor that is converted to its active coenzyme A (CoA) form in the hypothalamus. Enantioselective synthesis of C75 indicated that the (+)-C75 and (\u00b1)-C75-CoA adducts were the active forms inhibiting CPT1A despite the compound initially being found as a fatty acid synthase (FAS) inhibitor with a potent anorectic action via malonyl-CoA build-up. Hence, it is essential to transport (\u00b1)-C75-CoA directly into the brain for CPT1A inhibition and energy balance management to prevent the off-target effect on FAS and undesirable effects in the periphery.The current publication reports the development of a robust core-crosslinked polymeric micelle (PM)-type nanomedicine with a high CPT1A inhibitor (\u00b1)-C75-CoA entrapment efficiency. The crosslinked PM has demonstrated excellent biological activity upon delivery of the CPT1A inhibitor in brain cells, particularly to neurons, after intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration making the crosslinked PM valuable for in vivo applications.Furthermore, compared to the free drug, central administration of this (\u00b1)-C75-CoA-loaded core-crosslinked PM significantly reduced food intake and body weight in mice while also significantly regulating appetite-related neuropeptides, activating specific hypothalamic regions neuronally, and changing the expression of metabolic biomarkers in peripheral tissues.      Novelty and significance of this studyTreatments for metabolic diseases such as obesity or diabetes that control feeding, body weight, and glucose homeostasis are insufficient due to the difficulty of reaching specific brain targets. The current study reports on the first nanomedicine-based platform that acts on a brain target to drive a rapid modulation of food intake and peripheral metabolism, offering an innovative approach to managing metabolic diseases. The critical significance of this study are as follows:The core-crosslinked polymeric micelle-based nanomedicine used in this investigation allows the encapsulation of a drug that modifies lipid metabolism in the brain, a target hard to reach with conventional formulations.The effective delivery and higher neuronal uptake of the drug was evidenced in the potent and rapid satiating effect and significant body weight loss induced by central administration of core-crosslinked polymeric micelle loaded with C75-CoA in mice, as well as in the substantial regulation of appetite-related hypothalamic neuropeptides and neuronal activation of hypothalamic nuclei involved in feeding behavior, which were not observed in response to free (\u00b1)-C75-CoA treatment.This research can potentially create and validate a new generation of nanomedicine-based strategies by focusing on brain lipid metabolism to control food and body weight.In addition, this work emphasizes the significance of nanotechnology beyond its current biological uses. It makes it easier to comprehend the early stages of energy balance (i.e., acute satiating actions), which is critical for the emergence of complex disorders like obesity and diabetes.More information:Jes\u00fas Garcia-Chica et al, Nanomedicine targeting brain lipid metabolism as a feasible approach for controlling the energy balance, Biomaterials Science (2023).

  "text": "To realize true Internet of Things in future, compact monolithic integrated micro-supercapacitors (MIMSCs) with high systemic performance along with cell number density will become indispensable for powering miniaturized electronics, but their scalable production is still challenging. Several limitations stand as the barriers in their path.          Depositing electrolytes precisely on densely-packed micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) while ensuring electrochemical isolation is one of the most formidable challenges to overcome. In addition, electrochemical performance may be significantly sacrificed during complex microfabrication procedures, and even then, performance uniformity among numerous individual cells is difficult to achieve.To address these critical issues, Prof. Zhong-Shuai Wu and colleagues have developed an innovative and high-throughput strategy combining multi-step lithographic patterning, spray printing of MXene microelectrodes, and three-dimensional (3D) printing of gel electrolyte, for mass production of MIMSCs, simultaneously achieving superior cell number density and high systemic performance.The team achieved the monolithic integration of electrochemically isolated micro-supercapacitors in close proximity by leveraging high-resolution micropatterning techniques for microelectrode deposition and 3D printing for precise electrolyte deposition.First, benefiting from the high-resolution of lithographic patterning and uniqueness of MXene nanosheets, super-dense microelectrode-arrays were fabricated, and each individual MXene-based MSC exhibits an extremely small footprint of 1.8 mm2, high areal capacitance of 4.1 mF cm-2, high volumetric capacitance of 457 F cm-3, and stable performance at ultrahigh scan rate up to 500 V s-1.Second, they developed a simple, reliable and large throughput strategy for electrochemical isolation of individual units. For this a gel electrolyte ink compatible with novel 3D printing technique was designed rationally, enabling adjacent microcells to be electrochemically isolated at a close proximity of just 600 \u03bcm and provide outstanding performance uniformity.Consequently, the researchers were able to obtain MIMSCs with a superior areal number density of 28 cells cm-2 (400 cells on 3.5\u00d74.1 cm2), a record areal output voltage of 75.6 V cm-2, and an acceptable systemic volumetric energy density of 9.8 mWh cm-3, far exceeding those of the previously reported integrated MSCs.Attributed to the reliability and uniformity of each step in the microfabrication processes including lithography, spray printing, lift-off and 3D printing, the resulting MSCs showed excellent performance consistency on a larger scale, and the MIMSCs demonstrate good capacitance retention of 92% after 4000 cycles at an extremely high output voltage of 162 V (see image c below).\"This innovative microfabrication strategy marks a great advance as a new technological platform for monolithic micropower sources and will aid the applications where compact integration and high systemic performance is demanded from energy storage units,\" Wu says.The paper is published in the journal National Science Review.

  "text": "Classical robots, such as those used for manufacturing, can lift heavy loads and repeat automated processes precisely. But they are too rigid and bulky for delicate work and interaction with humans. The research field of soft robotics works on the development of robots made of soft, organic materials and flexible technical components. Materials researchers at Kiel University have now developed a novel soft conductive material.          Unlike conventional soft conductors, it shows remarkably stable electrical properties even upon deformation. The reason for this is the special structure of the material and a nanoscopic insulating thin film coating. The research team published its results in the current issue of the journal Advanced Functional Materials.Constant electrical resistance even during deformationUnlike classical robots, humans and animals can perform fluid and fine movements and adapt them to their environment. Inspired by nature, soft robotics therefore relies on elastic, organic materials made of carbon instead of conventional, rigid metals. In addition, soft robots need elastic electrical conductors for communication between their sensors and actuators.\"Conventional conductors made of metal conduct electricity well, of course, but they are too rigid for flexible components. Upon deformation they change their electrical resistance and this affects their use in soft robotics,\" says Dr. Fabian Sch\u00fctt, the head of the junior research group Multiscale Materials Engineering at the Chair of Functional Nanomaterials at Kiel University.In contrast, the resistance of the material, which Sch\u00fctt developed together with colleagues at the Institute of Materials Science at Kiel University, remains constant when it is deformed. \"Both, the initial electrical and mechanical properties are retained during long-term cycling, even after 2000 cycles at 50% compression,\" says Igor Barg, a doctoral researcher at the Chair for Multicomponent Materials and the first author of the article.By combining different expertise within the Priority Research Area KiNSIS (Kiel Nano, Surface and Interface Science) of Kiel University they created a material made of fine wires that looks like a dark sponge. The wires consist of interconnected microtubes made of an electrically conductive polymer. This delicate network structure makes the material ultra-light and at the same time extremely elastic.Credit: Kiel UniversityNanoscopic insulation film protects the electrical properties of the material \"Stretchable, sponge-like conductors have already been researched for several years. But as soon as they are deformed, their resistance also changes due to the so-called piezoresistive effect,\" Barg explains. To avoid this effect, the team coated their material with a non-conductive, nanoscopic thin film of Polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE).\"You can think of it as a classic power cable,\" says Barg. The layer prevents the wires from coming into direct contact with each other during compression and creating new electrically conductive paths. Thus, the resistance remains constant even upon large deformations. The insulation also improves the mechanical stability of the wires and protects their electrical properties from external influences such as moisture.In order to coat this highly porous framework structure, a special technique is needed. Dr. Stefan Schr\u00f6der is head of the junior research group Functional CVD Polymers at the Chair for Multicomponent Materials and works with the initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD).By this it is possible to even coat materials with complex structures and surfaces conformally: Bringing together different gases in a reactor sets off a chemical reaction and a thin polymer film begins to grow on the material to be coated. \"Since this coating is only a few nanometers thin, the wires remain elastic and the total weight of the material hardly increases,\" Schr\u00f6der explains.                Mechanical compression tests show how the coating (left) improves the elasticity compared to the same material without the coating (right). (Scale in blue: 6mm.). Credit: Igor Barg et. al, Adv.

Mater. 2023, 2212688 (CC BY 4.0)             Applications in medical technology are also conceivable\"This example shows very well how we can use nanoscale coating to specifically change the properties of our framework structures, which are up to several cubic centimeters in size, and even create completely new functions,\" says Sch\u00fctt.\"By combining our methods, other applications, including commercial ones, might be possible in the future, for example in medical technology or energy storage,\" adds Schr\u00f6der. They now want to investigate these possibilities in further joint research projects.

  "text": "Nanomaterials inspired by amyloid proteins are gaining interest in nanotechnology, due to their modularity, controlled self-assembly and stability. A key advantage of these materials is the possibility of incorporating protein molecules with the desired functionality through genetic design. However, many are unsuitable for biomedical applications, as they are insoluble and cannot be administered in body fluids.          Researchers at the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (UAB) have developed a new type of nanoparticle inspired by the structure of amyloids, one capable of neutralizing the SARS-CoV2 virus. The nanostructures, named OligoBinders, are soluble, biocompatible, and stable in plasma and have a high potency to bind viral particles. This binding blocks the interaction between the virus spike protein and the ACE2 receptor on the cell membrane responsible for the infection.The research, published in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, has been led by Salvador Ventura and Susanna Navarro, researchers from the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Institute of Biotechnology and Biomedicine (IBB) at the UAB.To develop the nanoparticles, researchers exploited the self-assembly capacity of a small yeast peptide, named Sup35, to which they fused two miniproteins, LCB1 and LCB3. These miniproteins are formed by three helices, are very stable, and establish multiple contacts with the viral protein.Their modular approach allowed them to design two spherical nanoparticles, each carrying more than 20 copies of LCB1 or LCB3 on their surface. \"This fact gives the nanoparticles great avidity for the virus and allows them to bind simultaneously to several spike proteins,\" explains Susanna Navarro.The researchers, who have carried out their study on particles similar to the SARS-CoV2 virus (SC2-VLP), highlight the great inhibitory power of these new nanoparticles and their potential as an efficient alternative to the use of monoclonal antibodies for capturing or neutralizing the virus.The developed nanospheres could have applications in biomedicine, for example, in self-administered nasal treatments, in biotechnology, to produce diagnostic kits, or as a potential prophylactic agent. In addition, large-scale production would be easy and inexpensive, as assembly occurs spontaneously after incubation of the molecules.\"The modular strategy we propose could be adapted for other viruses of interest, incorporating the corresponding inhibitory domain to the nanoparticle. In addition, it offers the possibility of building nanoparticles that combine two or more functional regions, which would simultaneously target different molecules of the same virus, to create molecules with enhanced antiviral activities in the future,\" says Salvador Ventura.

  "text": "One of the most expensive steps in manufacturing protein drugs such as antibodies or insulin is the purification step: isolating the protein from the bioreactor used to produce it. This step can account for up to half of the total cost of manufacturing a protein.          In an effort to help reduce those costs, MIT engineers have devised a new way to perform this kind of purification. Their approach, which uses specialized nanoparticles to rapidly crystallize proteins, could help to make protein drugs more affordable and accessible, especially in developing countries.\"This work uses bioconjugate-functionalized nanoparticles to act as templates for enhancing protein crystal formation at low concentrations,\" says Kripa Varanasi, a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT and the senior author of the new study. \"The goal is to reduce the cost so that this kind of drug manufacturing becomes affordable in the developing world.\"The researchers demonstrated that their approach can be used to crystallize lysozyme (an antimicrobial enzyme) and insulin. They believe it could also be applied to many other useful proteins, including antibody drugs and vaccines.MIT graduate student Caroline McCue is the lead author of the study, which appears today (Feb. 28) in the journal ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces. Henri-Louis Girard Ph.D. '20 is also an author of the paper.Protein purificationAntibodies and other protein drugs are part of a growing class of drugs known as biologics, which also include molecules such as DNA and RNA, as well as cell-based therapies. Most protein drugs are produced by living cells such as yeast in large bioreactors.Once these proteins are generated, they have to be isolated from the reactor, which is usually done through a process called chromatography. Chromatography, which separates proteins based on their size, requires specialized materials that make the process very expensive.Varanasi and his colleagues decided to try a different approach, based on protein crystallization. Researchers often crystallize proteins to study their structures, but the process is considered too slow for industrial use and doesn't work well at low concentrations of protein. To overcome those obstacles, Varanasi's lab set out to use nanoscale structures to speed up the crystallization.In previous work, the lab has used nanoscale features to create materials that repel water or to modify interfaces for injecting highly viscous biologic drugs. In this case, the researchers wanted to adapt nanoparticles so that they could locally increase the concentration of protein at the surface and also provide a template that would allow the proteins to align correctly and form crystals.In this time-lapse video, protein crystals form more rapidly on nanoparticles functionalized with molecules called bioconjugates (top). The nanoparticles at the bottom do not have the bioconjugate molecules. Credit: Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyTo create the surface they needed, the researchers coated gold nanoparticles with molecules called bioconjugates\u2014materials that can help form links between other molecules. For this study, the researchers used bioconjugates called maleimide and NHS, which are commonly used for tagging proteins for study or attaching protein drugs to drug-delivering nanoparticles.When solutions of proteins are exposed to these coated nanoparticles, the proteins accumulate at the surface and bind to the bioconjugates. Furthermore, the bioconjugates compel the proteins to align themselves with a specific orientation, creating a scaffold for additional proteins to come along and join the crystal.The researchers demonstrated their approach with lysozyme, an enzyme whose crystallization properties have been well studied, and insulin. They say it could also be applied to many other proteins.\"This is a general approach that could be scaled to other systems as well. If you know the protein structure that you're trying to crystallize, you can then add the right bioconjugates that will force this process to happen,\" Varanasi says.      Rapid crystallizationIn their studies with lysozyme and insulin, the researchers found that crystallization occurred much faster when the proteins were exposed to the bioconjugate-coated nanoparticles, compared to bare nanoparticles or no nanoparticles. With the coated particles, the researchers saw a sevenfold reduction in the induction time\u2014how long it takes for crystals to begin forming\u2014and a threefold increase in the nucleation rate, which is how quickly the crystals grow once started.\"Even at low protein concentrations, we see a lot more crystals forming with these bioconjugate-functionalized nanoparticles,\" McCue says. \"The functionalized nanoparticles reduce the induction time so much because these bioconjugates are providing a specific site for the proteins to bind. And because the proteins are aligned, they can form a crystal faster.\"In addition, the team used machine learning to analyze thousands of images of crystals. \"Protein crystallization is a stochastic process, so we needed to have a huge dataset to be able to really measure whether our approach was improving the induction time and nucleation rate of crystallization. With so many images to process, machine learning is the best way to be able to determine when crystals are forming in each image without having to go through and manually count each one,\" McCue says.This project is part of a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation effort to make biologic drugs, such as prophylactic antibodies that have been shown to prevent malaria in clinical trials, more widely available in developing nations.The MIT team is now working on scaling up the process so that it could be used in an industrial bioreactor, and demonstrating that it can work with monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and other useful proteins.\"If we can make it easier to manufacture these proteins anywhere, then everyone in the world can benefit,\" Varanasi says. \"We are not saying that this is going to be solved tomorrow because of us, but this is a small step that can contribute to that mission.\" More information:Caroline McCue et al,  Enhancing Protein Crystal Nucleation Using In Situ Templating on Bioconjugate-Functionalized Nanoparticles and Machine Learning, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces (2023).

  "text": "Nanoscale plastic particles like those that permeate most food and water pass from pregnant rats to their unborn children and may impair fetal development, according to a Rutgers study that suggests the same process happens in humans.          The paper is published in the journal Nanomaterials.\"Much remains unknown, but this is certainly cause for concern and follow-up study,\" said Philip Demokritou, the Henry Rutgers Chair and professor in nanoscience and environmental bioengineering at the Rutgers School of Public Health.Erosion chips microscopic particles off the billions of tons of plastics that are exposed to the elements in the environment. These particles mix with the food we eat and the air we breathe. A typical person ingests a credit card's worth of them every week, Demokritou said.Previous studies in pregnant laboratory animals have found adding these plastics to food impairs their offspring in numerous ways, but those studies didn't determine whether mothers passed the plastics to their children in utero.The study provided specially marked nanoscale plastics to five pregnant rats. Subsequent imaging found that these nanoplastic particles permeated not only their placentas but also the livers, kidneys, hearts, lungs and brains of their offspring.These findings demonstrate that ingested nanoscale polystyrene plastics can breach the intestinal barrier of pregnant mammals, the maternal-fetal barrier of the placenta and all fetal tissues. Future studies will investigate how different types of plastics cross cell barriers, how plastic particle size affects the process and how plastics harm fetal development, the researchers said.\"The use of plastics has exploded since the 1940s due to their low cost and versatile properties. From 9 billion metric tons produced over the last 60 years, 80 percent ended up in the environment, and only 10 percent were recycled,\" said Demokritou, who also holds appointments at Rutgers' School of Engineering and directs the Nanoscience and Advanced Materials Research Center at the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute.\"Petroleum-based plastics are not biodegradable, but weathering and photooxidation break them tiny fragments. These tiny fragments, called micro-nano-plastics, are found in human lungs, placentas and blood, raising human health concerns.\"\"As public health researchers, we are trying to assess the health risks from such an emerging contaminant to inform policymakers and develop mitigation strategies. The goal is also to increase the reuse and recycling of plastics and even replace them with biodegradable, biopolymer-based plastics. This is part of our bigger societal goal towards sustainability.\"Feeding pregnant lab animals nanoscale plastics\u2014a nanometer is one billionth of a meter, so the particles are far too small to be seen\u2014has been shown to restrict the growth of their offspring and to harm the development of their brains, livers, testicles, immune systems and metabolisms.It hasn't been shown yet that the amounts of nanoscale plastics that pregnant humans unavoidably ingest do the same thing to their children, though some studies suggest plastics affect human embryonic development, Demokritou said.

  "text": "A new form of heterostructure of layered two-dimensional (2D) materials may enable quantum computing to overcome key barriers to its widespread application, according to an international team of researchers.          The researchers were led by a team that is part of the Penn State Center for Nanoscale Science (CNS), one of 19 Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers (MRSEC) in the United States funded by the National Science Foundation. Their work was published Feb. 13 in Nature Materials.A regular computer consists of billions of transistors, known as bits, and are governed by binary code (\"0\" = off and \"1\" = on). A quantum bit, also known as a qubit, is based on quantum mechanics and can be both a \"0\" and a \"1\" at the same time. This is known as superposition and can enable quantum computers to be more powerful than the regular, classical computers.There is, however, an issue with building a quantum computer.\"IBM, Google, and others are trying to make and scale up quantum computers based upon superconducting qubits,\" said Jun Zhu, Penn State professor of physics and corresponding author of the study. \"How to minimize the negative effect of a classical environment, which causes error in the operation of a quantum computer, is a key problem in quantum computing.\"A solution for this problem may be found in an exotic version of a qubit known as a topological qubit.\"Qubits based on topological superconductors are expected to be protected by the topological aspect of the superconductivity and therefore more robust against the destructive effects of the environment,\" Zhu said.A topological qubit relates to topology in mathematics, where a structure is undergoing physical changes such as being bent or stretched, and still holds the properties of its original form. It is a theoretical type of qubit and has not been realized yet, but the basic idea is that the topological properties of certain materials can protect the quantum state from being disturbed by the classical environment.      There is currently a lot of focus on topological quantum computing, according to Cequn Li, graduate student in physics and first author of the study.\"Quantum computing is a very hot topic and people are thinking about how to build a quantum computer with less error in the computation,\" Li said. \"A topological quantum computer is an appealing way to do that. But a key to topological quantum computing is developing the right materials for it.\"The study's researchers have taken a step in this direction by developing a type of layered material called a heterostructure. The heterostructure in the study consists of a layer of a topological insulator material, bismuth antimony telluride or (Bi,Sb)2Te3, and a superconducting material layer, gallium.\"We developed a special measurement technique to probe the proximity-induced superconductivity at the surface of the (Bi,Sb)2Te3 film,\" Zhu said. \"The proximity-induced superconductivity is a key mechanism to realize a topological superconductor. Our work showed that it indeed occurs at the surface of the (Bi,Sb)2Te3 film. This is a first step towards the realization of a topological superconductor.\"However, such a topological insulator/superconductor heterostructure is difficult to create.\"It's not easy usually because different materials have different lattice structures,\" Li said. \"Also, if you put two materials together, they may react with one another chemically and you end up with a messy interface.\"Therefore, the researchers are using a synthesis technique known as confinement heteroepitaxy, which is being explored at MRSEC. This involves inserting a layer of epitaxial graphene, which is a sheet of carbon atoms of one or two atoms thick, between the gallium layer and the (Bi,Sb)2Te3 layer. Li notes this enables the layers to interface and combine, like snapping Lego blocks together.\"The graphene separates these two materials and acts as a chemical barrier,\" Li said. \"So, there's no reaction between them, and we end up with a very nice interface.\"In addition, the researchers demonstrated that this technique is scalable at the wafer level, which would make it an attractive option for future quantum computing. A wafer is a round slice of semiconductor material that serves as a substrate for microelectronics.\"Our heterostructure has all the elements for a topological superconductor but perhaps more importantly, it is a thin film and potentially scalable,\" Li said. \"So, a wafer scale thin film has a great potential for future applications, such as building a topological quantum computer.\"This research was a combined effort of the CNS's IRG1\u20142D Polar Metals and Heterostructures team, led by Zhu and Joshua Robinson, professor of materials science and engineering at Penn State. Other faculty involved in the research include Cui-Zu Chang, Henry W. Knerr Early Career Professor and associate professor of physics, and Danielle Reifsnyder Hickey, assistant professor of chemistry and materials science and engineering.\"This was remarkable teamwork by the IRG1 team of our MRSEC,\" Zhu said. \"The Robinson group grew the two atomic layer gallium film using confinement heteroepitaxy, the Chang group grew the topological insulator film using molecular beam epitaxy, and the Reifsnyder Hickey group and Materials Research Institute staff performed atomic scale characterization of the heterostructure and devices.\"The next step is to perfect the process and take an even further step towards bringing a topological quantum computer into reality.\"The material is key so our collaborators are trying to improve the material,\" Li said. \"This means better uniformity and higher quality.

  "answer_squad": " depends on external conditions",
  "text": "Chaotic behavior is typically known from large systems: for example, from weather, from asteroids in space that are simultaneously attracted by several large celestial bodies, or from swinging pendulums that are coupled together. On the atomic scale, however, one does normally not encounter chaos\u2014other effects predominate.          Now, for the first time, scientists at TU Wien have been able to detect clear indications of chaos on the nanometer scale\u2014in chemical reactions on tiny rhodium crystals. The results have been published in the journal Nature Communications.From inactive to active\u2014and back againThe chemical reaction studied is actually quite simple: with the help of a precious metal catalyst, oxygen reacts with hydrogen to form water, which is also the basic principle of a fuel cell. The reaction rate depends on external conditions (pressure, temperature). Under certain conditions, however, this reaction shows oscillating behavior, even though the external conditions are constant.\"Similar to the way a pendulum swings from left to right and back again, the reaction rate oscillates between barely perceptible and high, and thus the catalytic system oscillates back and forth between inactive and active states,\" explains Prof. G\u00fcnther Rupprechter from the Institute of Materials Chemistry at TU Wien.A pendulum is a classic example of something predictable\u2014if you disturb it a bit or set it in motion twice in slightly different ways, it behaves broadly the same. In this sense, it is the opposite of a chaotic system, where minimal differences in the initial conditions lead to strongly differing results in the long-term behavior. A prime example of this behavior are several pendulums connected by elastic bands.Setting exactly the same initial conditions twice is impossible\"In principle, of course, laws of nature still determine exactly how pendulums behave,\" says Prof. Yuri Suchorski (TU Wien). \"If we could start such a coupled system of pendulums in exactly the same way twice, the pendulums would move exactly the same way both times.\"But in practice, that's impossible: you'll never be able to perfectly recreate the same initial situation the second time as you did the first\u2014and even a vanishingly small difference in the initial conditions will cause the system to behave completely different than the first time\u2014this is the famous \"butterfly effect\": small differences in the initial conditions lead to huge differences in the state at a later time.Something very similar has now been observed during chemical oscillations on a rhodium nanocrystal: \"The crystal consists of many different surface nanofacets, like a polished diamond, but much smaller, on the order of nanometers,\" explain Maximilian Raab and Johannes Zeininger, who performed the experiments. \"On each of these facets, the chemical reaction oscillates, but the reactions on neighboring facets are coupled.\"      Switching\u2014from order to chaosThe coupling behavior can now be controlled in a remarkable way\u2014by changing the amount of hydrogen. Initially, one facet dominates and sets the pace like a pacemaker. All other facets join in and oscillate to the same beat. If one increases the hydrogen concentration, the situation becomes more complicated. Different facets oscillate with different frequencies\u2014but still their behavior is periodic and well predictable.However, if one then increases the hydrogen concentration further, this order suddenly breaks down. Chaos wins, the oscillations become unpredictable, small differences in the initial situation lead to completely different oscillation patterns\u2014a clear sign of chaos.\"This is remarkable because you wouldn't really expect chaotic behavior in nanometer-sized structures,\" says Yuri Suchorski. \"The smaller the system, the greater the contribution of stochastic noise. In fact, the noise, which is something completely different from chaos, should dominate the behavior of the system: it is even more interesting that it was possible to 'extract' indications of chaos\". A theoretical model was particularly useful, developed by Prof. Keita Tokuda.Chaos research applied to nano-chemistry\"Research on chaos theory has been going on for decades, and it has already been successfully applied to chemical reactions in larger (macroscopic) systems, but our study is the first attempt to transfer the extensive knowledge from this field to the nanometer scale,\" says G\u00fcnther Rupprechter.\"Small deviations in the symmetry of the crystal can determine whether the catalyst behaves in an ordered and predictable way or in a disordered and chaotic way. This is important for different chemical reactions\u2014and perhaps even for biological systems.\" More information:Maximilian Raab et al, Emergence of chaos in a compartmentalized catalytic reaction nanosystem, Nature Communications (2023).

  "text": "Recently, a team led by Prof. Lu Junling collaborating with Prof. Li Weixue's and Prof. Wei Shiqiang's team, revealed the conjugated dual size effect of core-shell bimetallic nanocatalysts for the first time, with the activity of the catalysts increases with the core size in the benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction. Their work was published in Nature Communications.          Bimetallic catalysts are widely used in different chemical synthesis for their bimetallic synergy varying with compositions and structures. Compared to alloy catalysts, the peculiar lattice strains and ligand effects of core-shell catalysts can optimize the geometric and electronic properties. The shell thickness significantly affects bimetallic synergy because the ligand effects and the charge transfers between components usually happen at the core-shell interface.The lattice strains in core-shell catalyst occur due to lattice mismatch between the metal core and the shell, which have a prominent effect on the electronic structure of the metal shell and the overall activity of catalysts. When the core size is reduced, its lattice contracts considerably, which affects its mismatch with shell lattice, consequently modulates the lattice strains in the shell. This dual size effect of core-shell particles has not yet been explored due to the immense challenge in adjusting the core size and shell thickness at atomic level.To solve these difficulties, the three teams chose solvent-free selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BzOH) as probe reaction, and revealed the dual size effect of Au@Pd catalyst using atomic layer deposition, multi-spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The theoretical calculations conducted by Prof. Li Weixue's team showed that the lattices of Pd overlayer on Au particles expand and tend to enhance BzOH adsorption, while a reduced Au core size would reduce the strains on the Pd shell.Further calculations found that the ligand effects of Au core would drastically weaken the BzOH adsorption but could became negligible when the Pd shell thickness reached 2 monolayers (ML) and above. Therefore, the highest adsorption energy can be obtained if the large-sized Au core is wrapped by 2 ML thick Pd shell.To experimentally examine the dual size effect, Prof.LU Junling's team first synthesized Au/SiO2 catalysts with different Au sizes and executed Pd ALD to yield Pd shells with varying thickness on Au particles at atomic level. Then, using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), the team revealed the evolution of the atomic and electronic structure of Au and Pd in the core-shell structure with the Au core size and Pd shell thickness.Results showed that in the oxidation of BzOH, with a fixed Au core size, the activity of catalysts increased with Pd shell thickness quickly and peaked at 2.9ML before it began to drop. With a fixed Pd shell thickness, the activity also improved with increasing core size. The team achieved a maximum activity higher than previous studies in Au6.8@2.9ML-Pd catalyst.Similar conjugated effect was found in hydrogenation of para-chloronitrobenzene (p-CNB), exhibiting the universality of the effect. This work provided significant guideline for the future design of highly efficient bimetallic catalysts.

  "text": "The RNA molecule is commonly recognized as messenger between DNA and protein, but it can also be folded into intricate molecular machines. An example of a naturally occurring RNA machine is the ribosome, that functions as a protein factory in all cells.          Inspired by natural RNA machines, researchers at the Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (iNANO) have developed a method called \"RNA origami,\" which makes it possible to design artificial RNA nanostructures that fold from a single stand of RNA. The method is inspired by the Japanese paper folding art, origami, where a single piece of paper can be folded into a given shape, such as a paper bird.Frozen folds provide new insightThe research paper in Nature Nanotechnology describes how the RNA origami technique was used to design RNA nanostructures, that were characterized by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) at the Danish National cryo-EM Facility EMBION. Cryo-EM is a method for determining the 3D structure of biomolecules, which works by freezing the sample so quickly that water does not have time to form ice crystals, which means that frozen biomolecules can be observed more clearly with the electron microscope.Images of many thousands of molecules can be converted on the computer into a 3D map, that is used to build an atomic model of the molecule. The cryo-EM investigations provided valuable insight into the detailed structure of the RNA origamis, which allowed optimization of the design process and resulted in more ideal shapes.\"With precise feedback from cryo-EM, we now have the opportunity to fine-tune our molecular designs and construct increasingly intricate nanostructures,\" explains Ebbe Sloth Andersen, associate professor at iNANO, Aarhus University.Video shows the two different shapes of the same RNA molecule and the suggested transition between them.

McRae, Aarhus UniversityDiscovery of a slow folding trapCryo-EM images of an RNA cylinder sample turned out to contain two very different shapes, and by freezing the sample at different times it was evident that a transition between the two shapes was taking place. Using the technique of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), where the samples are not frozen, the researchers were able to observe this transition in real time and found that the folding transition occurred after approx. 10 hours.The researchers had discovered a so-called \"folding trap\" where the RNA gets trapped during transcription and only later gets released.\"It was quite a surprise to discover an RNA molecule that refolds this slow since folding typically takes place in less than a second\" tells Jan Skov Pedersen, Professor at Department of Chemistry and iNANO, Aarhus University.\"We hope to be able to exploit similar mechanisms to activate RNA therapeutics at the right time and place in the patient,\" explains Ewan McRae, the first author of the study, who is now starting his own research group at the \"Centre for RNA Therapeutics\" at the Houston Methodist Research Institute in Texas, U.S..

Construction of a nanosatellite from RNATo demonstrate the formation of complex shapes, the researchers combined RNA rectangles and cylinders to create a multi-domain \"nanosatellite\" shape, inspired by the Hubble Space Telescope.\"I designed the nanosatellite as a symbol of how RNA design allows us to explore folding space (possibility space of folding) and intracellular space, since the nanosatellite can be expressed in cells,\" says Cody Geary, assistant professor at iNANO, who originally developed the RNA-origami method.However, the satellite proved difficult to characterize by cryo-EM due to its flexible properties, so the sample was sent to a laboratory in the U.S., where they specialize in determining the 3D structure of individual particles by electron tomography, the so-called IPET-method.\"The RNA satellite was a big challenge! But by using our IPET method, we were able to characterize the 3D shape of individual particles and thus determine the positions of the dynamic solar panels on the nanosatellite,\" says Gary Ren from the Molecular Foundry at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, California, U.S..The future of RNA medicineThe investigation of the RNA origamis contributes to improving the rational design of RNA molecules for use in medicine and synthetic biology. A new interdisciplinary consortium, COFOLD, supported by the Novo Nordisk Foundation, will continue the investigations of RNA folding processes by involving researchers from computer science, chemistry, molecular biology, and microbiology to design, simulate and measure folding at higher time resolution.\"With the RNA design problem partially solved, the road is now open to creating functional RNA nanostructures that can be used for RNA-based medicine, or act as RNA regulatory elements to reprogram cells,\" says Ebbe Sloth Andersen.

  "text": "Prof. Ding Junfeng and his team from the Hefei Institutes of Physical Science (HFIPS) of the Chinese Academy of Science, together with Prof. Zhang Genqiang from the University of Science and Technology of China, have achieved band gap optimization and photoelectric response enhancement of carbon nitride in the nitrogen vacancy graphite phase under high pressure.          Their results were published in the journal Physical Review Applied.Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has performed well in many fields, such as high-efficiency photocatalytic hydrogen production and water oxidation. However, the wide band gap of 2.7 eV of the original g-C3N4 limits its light absorption in the visible region. High pressure technology is an effective strategy to change the properties while remaining composition. Therefore, band gap engineering of g-C3N4 by high-pressure technology can significantly enhance its photocatalytic activity and improve its application potential.In this study, the researchers prepared N-containing vacancy defect g-C3N4 nanosheets with a nitrogen/carbon ratio of 9:10 by alkali assisted thermal polymerization.They then carried out a series of investigations on the band gap evolution and photoelectric response behavior of g-C3N4 under high pressure. They used a diamond anvil cell combined with Raman spectroscopy, synchrotron X-ray diffraction, high-pressure absorption spectroscopy, and photocurrent measurement techniques.                Color change of g-C3N4 in diamond anvil cell under high pressure. Credit: Cheng Peng             An important phenomenon was that g-C3N4 underwent a pressure-induced amorphization (PIA) from graphite to amorphous phase at 17 GPa. Under high pressure, the PL of N-deficient g-C3N4 changed from yellow to red, and the minimum band gap reached 1.70 eV.The narrowed band gap enhanced light absorption in the visible region and increased the visible photocurrent from 18 nA to 29 nA. When the applied pressure was higher than the PIA transition pressure, a narrow band gap could still be maintained at ambient conditions, allowing a wide range of g-C3N4 band gap engineering from 1.87 eV to 2.42 eV.This study provides a vacancy/defect assisted PIA strategy that could be used to design and tune the band gap of materials, and improve photoelectric performance for a variety of applications under ambient conditions.

  "text": "In a new report now published in Science Advances, Mingze Sun and a research team in physics, mechanical engineering, electrical and electronic engineering in Hong Kong China reported the development of multifunctional tendon-mimetic hydrogels by assembling aramid nanofiber composites.          The anisotropic composite hydrogels (ACH) contained stiff nanofibers and soft polyvinyl alcohol moieties to mimic biological interactions that typically occur between collagen fibers and proteoglycans in tendons. The team was bioinspired by natural tendons to develop hydrogels with a high elastic modulus, strength and fracture toughness.The researchers biofunctionalized these material surfaces with bioactive molecules to present biophysical cues to impart behavioral similarities to those of cell attachment. Additionally, the soft bioelectronic components integrated on the hydrogels facilitated a variety of physiological benefits. Based on the outstanding functionality of the tendon-mimetics, the team envisioned broader applications of the materials in advanced tissue engineering to form implantable prosthetics for human-machine interactions.Materials engineering a biomimetic tendonMaterials scientists work to develop advanced biological materials for medical devices and tissue engineering platforms to emulate natural biological tissue architectures via materials engineering. However, the natural tissue architecture has a variety of characteristics that are difficult to synthetically replicate. The architecture of tendons relies on the load-bearing capacities of the musculoskeletal system to provide biophysical cues that translate into cellular behaviors via interfacial interactions. In the past decade, researchers had devoted extensive research efforts to engineer tendon-mimetic materials with high structural anisotropy.Sun and colleagues developed an advanced materials platform for their work to construct hybrid anisotropic hydrogels with tendon-like behaviors and multifunctionality at the bio-interfaces. During the experiments, they established reconfigurable interactions between the stiff and flexible polymers to form a highly oriented framework that emulated a microstructural interplay between aligned collagen fibers and the soft proteoglycans. The biomimetic results of the anisotropic biophysical cues thereby regulated the cell behavior.                Mechanics of ACHs.

DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.ade6973             Creating an advanced polymer material in the labThe research team developed anisotropic composite hydrogels by stretching and confining the material consisting of stiff and flexible polymer constituents. The resulting material demonstrated branched microstructures that mimicked collagen-like building blocks.The team conducted extensive hydrogen bonding between the two polymer constituents to create a three-dimensional network with high toughness where the fibrillar network did not undergo structural disintegration even under high levels of strain, leading to their consistent alignment. They then observed the characteristic fibrillar network of isotropic hydrogels that resembled hierarchical structures as seen in natural tendons\u2014such efforts weren't as feasible with pre-existing synthetic hydrogels.

DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.ade6973             Biofunctionalization of the advanced polymers The scientists next studied the structural characterization of the new polymer and its influence on cell behavior via interfacial interactions. They adopted chemical functionalization to present a cell adhesion motif such as the arginylglycylaspartic acid motifs to bind with integrins on the cell membrane. The researchers noted the successful biofunctionalization of the advanced materials by observing the adhesion of fibroblast cells on the material surfaces, while samples without surface functionalization did not demonstrate similar cell attachment.The Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) molecules played a significant role by regulating the contractile machinery of cells during cell morphological responses to surface topography and substrate mechanics. The material constructs additionally regulated the macrophage cell differentiation between the pro-inflammatory M1 variants and the pro-healing M2 variants to establish bio-favorable implantable devices.Advanced materials applications as bioelectronics The research team ultimately demonstrated multimodal physiological sensing by integrating the advanced materials into soft bioelectronics. Among these iterations, they adopted a serpentine design to create wafer-based electronics with high stretchability to withstand the prewashing-drying process of the materials. They used finite element analysis to assess stress distribution across the device and enhanced the stretchability of the electronic component by modifying its geometrical design for improved mechanical integrity.

DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.ade6973             OutlookIn this way, Mingze Sun and colleagues engineered tendon-mimetic hydrogels with outstanding mechanics and functionality that predominantly originated from the assembly of nanofibers. They used biophysical cues presented by the materials constituents to regulate the cell dynamics, useful for advanced tissue engineering applications. The tendon-mimetic behavior of the advanced materials were useful as implantable tissue prosthetics.The researchers examined the physical integration between the advanced materials and natural tissues in vivo and envision the possibilities of using multifunctional bioelectronics integrated on advanced materials. These include delivering critical capabilities such as physiological monitoring and integrating wireless modules for two-way communications between the external hardware and the electronically active prostheses.

  "text": "Nanoplastics are plastics that have been discarded from our daily lives and that enter ecosystems in the size scale below 1 \u03bcm after their physical and chemical disintegration. Recent research has shown that the concentration of microplastics in the major rivers in South Korea is the highest worldwide; it is not unusual to find news reports about the detection of microplastics in simple tea bags or drinking water.          The impact of micro/nanoplastics on human health and the environment in general is considered significant. However, the detection of nanoplastics is limited because their concentration is low and their size is extremely small. In addition, the detection process requires a few hours to days, and incurs significant costs during the pre-processing step of concentrating the plastic sample.The research team of Dr. Yong-sang Ryu at the Brain Research Institute of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) have used an electro-photonic tweezer along with metal nanoparticles to concentrate ultrafine nanoplastics within a short time period, and they report the development of a real-time detection system using light.The research team supplied electricity to a large-area vertically-aligned metal sandwiched by a nanofilm insulator. They conducted Raman spectroscopy, which analyzes the energy difference between the incident and scattered light according to the frequency of the molecule. By combining the two techniques\u2014electrical nanoparticle capture together with real-time Raman spectroscopy\u2014the research team achieved the detection of a 30-nm 10 \u03bcg L-1 polystyrene particle with the help of gold nanoparticles via surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.ACS Nano front cover selection. Credit: ACS Nano In addition, the research team easily separated the particle from the sample through the dielectrophoresis phenomenon. Thus, the entire process including the collection, separation, and analysis, which previously required at least one day, was reduced to only several seconds by employing an original technology that separates and detects plastics using one platform.The study is published in the journal ACS Nano.Researchers Euitae Jeong and Dr. Eui-Sang Yu at KIST who performed this research stated, \"The findings of this research are meaningful in that ultrahigh-sensitivity detection of microplastics in real-time has become possible, and the proposed approach can be extended to the measurement of the microplastic concentration in various water resources and applied as a water resource securement technology.\" More information:Eui-Sang Yu et al, Real-Time Underwater Nanoplastic Detection beyond the Diffusion Limit and Low Raman Scattering Cross-Section via Electro-Photonic Tweezers, ACS Nano (2022).

  "text": "An international team of researchers has developed a new technique to enhance the durability of inverted perovskite solar cells\u2014an important step toward commercialization of an emerging photovoltaic technology that could significantly reduce the cost of solar energy.          Unlike traditional solar cells, which are made from wafers of extremely high-purity silicon, perovskite solar cells are built from nano-sized crystals. These perovskite crystals can be dispersed into a liquid and spin-coated onto a surface using low-cost, well-established techniques.It is also possible to tune the wavelengths of light that get absorbed by the perovskites by adjusting the thickness and chemical composition of the crystal films. Perovskite layers tuned to different wavelengths can even be stacked on top of each other, or on top of traditional silicon cells, leading to \"tandem\" cells that absorb more of the solar spectrum than today's devices.The latest work, published in the journal Science, included researchers from the University of Toronto, Northwestern University, the University of Toledo and the University of Washington.\"Perovskite solar cells have the potential to overcome the inherent efficiency limitations of silicon solar cells,\" says study co-author Ted Sargent, who recently joined the department of chemistry and the department of electrical and computer engineering at Northwestern University but remains affiliated with U of T Engineering, where he has a research lab.\"They are also amenable to manufacturing methods that have a much lower cost than those used for silicon. But one place where perovskites still lag silicon is in their long-term durability. In this study, we used a rational-design approach to address that in a new and unique way.\"In recent years, Sargent and his collaborators have made several advances that improve the performance of perovskite solar cells. But whereas much of this previous work focused on enhancing efficiency, their latest work looks at the challenge of durability.\"One key point of vulnerability in these types of solar cells is the interface between the perovskite layer and the adjacent layers, which we call carrier transport layers,\" says Chongwen Li, a post-doctoral researcher who recently moved to U of T Engineering from the University of Toledo and is one of the paper's lead co-authors.\"These adjacent layers extract the electrons or holes that will flow through the circuit. If the chemical bonding between these layers and perovskite layer gets damaged by light or heat, electrons or holes can't get into the circuit\u2014this lowers the overall efficiency of the cell,\" Li says.      To address this issue, the international research team went back to first principles. They used computer simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) to predict what kind of molecules would be best at creating a bridge between the perovskite layer and the charge transport layers.\"Previous research has shown that molecules known as Lewis bases are good for creating strong bonding between these layers,\" says Bin Chen, a post-doctoral researcher in Sargent's lab who is now a research assistant professor at Northwestern University and a co-author on the paper.\"This is because one end of the molecule bonds to the lead atoms in the perovskite layer and the other bonds to the nickel in the carrier transport layers. What our simulations predicted was that Lewis acids, which contained the element phosphorus, would have the best effect.\"In the lab, the team tried out various formulations of phosphorus-containing molecules. Their experiments showed the best performance with a material known as 1,3 bis(diphenylphosphino)propane, or DPPP.The team built inverted perovskite solar cells that contained DPPP, as well as some without. They subjected both types to tests that simulated the kind of conditions solar cells would experience in the field, illuminating them with light at a similar intensity to the sun. They also tried exposing them to high temperatures, both in the light and in the dark.\"With DPPP, under ambient conditions\u2014that is, no additional heating\u2014the overall power conversion efficiency of the cell stayed high for approximately 3,500 hours,\" says Li.\"The perovskite solar cells that have been previously published in the literature tend to see a significant drop in their efficiency after 1,500 to 2,000 hours, so this is a big improvement.\"Li says the team has applied for a patent for the DPPP technique and has already received interest from commercial solar cell manufacturers.\"I think what we've done is to show a new path forward\u2014that DFT simulations and rational design can point the way toward promising solutions,\" he says.\"But there may be even better molecules out there. Ultimately, we want to get to a place where perovskite solar cells can compete commercially with silicon, which is the state-of-the-art photovoltaic technology of today. This is an important step in that direction, but there is still further to go.\" More information:Chongwen Li et al, Rational design of Lewis base molecules for stable and efficient inverted perovskite solar cells, Science (2023).

  "answer_squad": " 2D Janus materials",
  "text": "Several studies have predicted that the water splitting reaction could be catalyzed by certain groups of 2D materials\u2014each measuring just a few atoms thick. One particularly promising group are named 2D Janus materials, whose two sides each feature a different molecular composition.          Through new calculations detailed in The European Physical Journal B, Junfeng Ren and colleagues at Shandong Normal University in China present a new group of four 2D Janus materials, which could be especially well suited to the task.Since hydrogen releases an abundance of energy when combusted, with only water as a byproduct, it is now widely seen as an excellent alternative to fossil fuels. Splitting water molecules involves a redox reaction, where electrons and holes participate in reduction and oxidation reactions.Since they are excellent semiconductors, 2D Janus materials are particularly well suited to catalyzing this reaction. When an electron in a semiconductor's insulating valence band absorbs a photon, it is excited to the material's conduction band, leaving behind a positively charged hole. In turn, these materials as both source and acceptors of electrons\u2014allowing redox reactions to occur more readily.In their theoretical study, Ren's team examined a group of four of these materials: with one surface composed of either selenium or tellurium, and the other from either bromine or iodine\u2014with both sides sandwiching a middle layer of arsenic. In these semiconductors, the energies of their valence and conduction bands were far enough apart to prevent electrons and holes from readily recombining: allowing them to combine electrons and holes to produce hydrogen and oxygen.With all four materials displaying excellent stability and light absorption, the researchers believe they could be incredibly promising candidates for catalyzing the water splitting reaction. If these results can be reproduced in experiments, Ren's team hope the four materials could become a key element of the global effort to eliminate our carbon emissions in the next few decades.

  "answer_squad": " WSe2",
  "text": "A slow-motion movie on sports television channels shows processes in hundredths of a second. By contrast, processes on the nanoscale take place in the so-called femtosecond range: For example, an electron needs only billionths of a second to orbit a hydrogen atom.          Physicists around the world are using special instruments to capture such ultrafast nano-processes in films. Researchers at Kiel University (CAU) have developed a new method for such films that is based on a different physical concept and thus allows further and more precise options for investigation.To do this, they combined an electron microscope with nanostructured metallic thin films that generate very short light pulses. In a first experiment, they were thus able to document the coherent interactions of light and electrons in a semiconductor on film. Their results are published in Nature Physics.New method is simpler and more cost-effectiveUntil now, movies showing ultrafast nano-processes have typically been produced using high-power lasers combined with electron microscopes. But only a few research groups can afford the large and complex setups. \"Our concept does not require expensive and complicated lasers and can be easily replicated,\" says Nahid Talebi, Professor of Experimental Physics at the CAU.Electron microscopes bundle electrons into a beam, accelerate it and direct it at a material sample. How the electrons pass through the sample or are reflected allows conclusions about the properties of the materials and the processes inside.\"Electron microscopes have a significantly better spatial resolution than optical microscopes and make investigations in the nanometer range possible in the first place,\" says Talebi. The special components she has developed make it relatively easy to improve also the temporal resolution of electron microscopes and convert them to their ultrafast versions. By this nanoscale processes can now also be captured in ultrafast films on the femtosecond time scale without lasers.With her new publication, Talebi not only demonstrates that her method works. Together with her research associate Dr. Masoud Taleb, she also provides experimental evidence for coherent interactions of photons and electrons in a semiconductor, which had previously only been described theoretically. The quantum material tungsten diselenide, WSe2, used for this purpose originates from a collaboration with Professor Kai Rossnagel within the priority research area KiNSIS (Kiel Nano, Surface and Interface Science) at Kiel University.Credit: Kiel UniversityNano-structured metal generates short light pulsesA central component of Talebi's concept is a special nanostructure looking similar to a kitchen sieve. It can be inserted into an electron microscope, where it functions like a light source, called \"EDPHS\" (electron-driven photon source). When an electron beam hits this metal structure, the hole pattern generates targeted, short light pulses that can be used to make fast films.To create the special structure the researchers drilled tiny holes of 25 to 200 nanometers into a thin gold foil. Talebi had precisely calculated the size and distances, because the light pulses only occur with a certain hole pattern. The \"nanosieves\" were produced in close collaboration with Dr. Mario Hentschel from the research group of Prof. Harald Giessen, University of Stuttgart.Together with colleagues from Amsterdam, Talebi had previously modified the electron microscope so that it can detect cathodoluminescence. These light signals are generated when fast electrons hit metal.Interactions between electrons and photons documented in filmsIn the experiment described in the current publication, the short light pulses from the sieve-like nanostructures hit the semiconductor sample at the speed of light. Here they excite excitons, so-called quasiparticles.These are electrons that have detached themselves from an atom and are still coupled to the hole they created (\"electron-hole pairs\"). \"If a short time later the slower electron beam also hits the semiconductor sample, we can see from the reaction of the electrons how the excitons have behaved in the meantime,\" explains Talebi.The resulting cathodoluminescence signals from the superposition of the electron beam and the light pulses show a coherent interaction between electrons and photons.To be able to capture these processes in a film, the researchers also integrated a piezoelectric crystal into the microscope setup. This allows them to precisely change the spatial distance between the light source and the sample, and by this also the temporal distance between the incident light pulses and the electrons. \"In this way, images can be taken at different stages of the process and assembled into a film,\" Talebi summarizes.

  "text": "Molybdenum disulfide MoS2 is a groundbreaking material for electronics applications. As a two-dimensional layer similar to graphene, it is an excellent semiconductor, and can even become intrinsically superconducting under the right conditions. It's not particularly surprising that science fiction authors have already been speculating about molycircs, fictional computer circuits built from MoS2, for years\u2014and that physicists and engineers are directing huge research efforts at this material.       Researchers at the University of Regensburg, have many years of expertise with diverse quantum materials\u2014in particular also with carbon nanotubes, tube-like macromolecules made from carbon atoms alone.\"It was an obvious next step to now focus on MoS2 and its fascinating properties,\" said Dr. Andreas K. H\u00fcttel, head of the research group Nanotube Electronics and Nanomechanics in Regensburg. In cooperation with Prof. Dr. Maja Rem\u0161kar, Jo\u017eef Stefan Institut Ljubljana, a specialist in the crystalline growth of molybdenum disulfide nanomaterials, his research group started working on quantum devices based on MoS2 nanotubes.                Low temperature setup during initial assembly. Credit: Dr. Andreas K. H\u00fcttel, Univ. Regensburg             \"It turns out that MoS2 makes quantum confinement, i.e., discrete electronic states as you would need for qubits and quantum computers, very difficult to reach with flat flakes on a chip. That is exactly why we are interested in these exotic nanotubes. The tubes can be grown clean and straight, with diameters down to 20nm\u2014and will then automatically give you the small structure sizes that you need.\"The initial challenge was to make good metallic contacts. Useful metals with low contact resistances tend to react with the MoS2 surface and destroy its crystal structure, a difficulty that affects also \"flat\" MoS2 and is one of the main reasons why not many complex circuits exist there yet.For nanotubes, with small surface areas, this difficulty used to be even more pressing. \"Now finally we obtain devices which remain electrically transparent even in the low temperature range typically needed for quantum computation, and which leave the molybdenum disulfide intact,\" said Dr. H\u00fcttel.

Regensburg                 And that's not all\u2014the structure sizes immediately came into play. \"So far, for practical reasons we used rather large nanotubes and nanoribbons. Still, we can show that in our low temperature setup, at temperatures below 0.1K as are used in many quantum computing approaches, current passes through discrete quantum states in our chip\u2014and that is a big step towards controllable charge, spin, or even valley qubits in MoS2.\"The research is published in the journal Advanced Materials.

Wearable sensors can be used to monitor a person's perspiration rate and provide information about the skin, nervous system activity and underlying health conditions. But not all sweat is created equal, and some cannot be measured with current sensors. A newly developed superhydrophobic biosensor could be used as a diagnostic tool to detect such types of sweat.       The sensor, developed by Huanyu \"Larry\" Cheng, James L. Henderson, Jr. Memorial Associate Professor of Engineering Science and Mechanics, was featured in a paper published in ACS Nano.Sensible, or liquid, perspiration is sweat that can be perceived by a person, such as during intensive exercise. Wearable sensors can provide continuous, non-invasive tracking of this type of sweat. Insensible, or vapor, perspiration is different. It is the loss of only water from the skin, secreted at a much smaller rate during low-intensity exercise or rest, and measuring it is difficult, according to Cheng.\"Monitoring insensible sweat is of high interest for evaluating skin health and disease conditions, such as eczema and wound healing, as well as underlying health statuses, such as pain or anxiety,\" Cheng said. \"Skin-interfaced devices that detect sweat rate and loss are currently limited to working with sensible sweat and are not suitable for insensible sweat in a vapor state.\"                A superabsorbent hydrogel composite on a porous substrate is sandwiched between two superhydrophobic textile layers to allow the permeation of sweat vapor while preventing the sensor from being affected by the external water droplets of sensible perspiration.\u00a0Credit: Provided by Larry Cheng/Penn State             Cheng developed a prototype of a superhydrophobic sweat sensor to measure vapor from insensible perspiration.

  "text": "A research team led by Dr. Li Zhaoqian from the Hefei Institutes of Physical Science (HFIPS) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences found that the addition of 1,4-dioxane (DX) molecules to the electrolyte of aqueous zinc-ion (Zn) battery would lead to the growth of the preferred Zn (002) texture, effectively suppressing the Zn dendrite growth and improving the reversibility and cycling stability of the batteries.          The study was published in ACS Nano.Aqueous rechargeable zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are an emerging sustainable system for the next generation of grid-scale energy storage technology. However, the implementation of this technology has been plagued by the severe dendrite problem and poor reversibility of the Zn anode.In the hexagonal close-packed Zn crystal, the (002) facet has the lowest surface energy and the slowest growth rate, which enables a surface-reaction-controlled deposition process and thus mitigates the rampant Zn2+ flux and side-reactions. Therefore, inducing a preferred Zn (002) texture can effectively alleviate the dendrite growth and the formation of side-reactions.In this study, the researchers constructed an advanced electrolyte modulation strategy to adjust the anode/electrolyte interface. In this new system, the adsorption of DX on the Zn surface can induce Zn (002) texture growth and suppress the detrimental side-reactions.The performance of the new system was validated in subsequent experiments. The battery with the addition of DX showed a long-term cycling stability of 1000 h, even under the harsh condition of 10 mA cm-2 with an ultra-high cumulative plated capacity of 5 Ah cm-2. The battery also showed a high reversibility with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.7%.                a.

  "answer_squad": " Geobacter sulfurreducens",
  "text": "Scientists at the University of Massachusetts Amherst recently announced the invention of a nanowire, 10,000 times thinner than a human hair, which can be cheaply grown by common bacteria and can be tuned to \"smell\" a vast array of chemical tracers\u2014including those given off by people afflicted with different medical conditions, such as asthma and kidney disease.          Thousands of these specially tuned wires, each sniffing out a different chemical, can be layered onto tiny, wearable sensors, allowing health-care providers an unprecedented tool for monitoring potential health complications. Since these wires are grown by bacteria, they are organic, biodegradable and far greener than any inorganic nanowire.To make these breakthroughs, which were detailed in the journal Biosensors and Bioelectrics, senior authors Derek Lovley, Distinguished Professor of Microbiology at UMass Amherst, and Jun Yao, professor of electrical and computer engineering in the College of Engineering at UMass Amherst, needed to look no farther than their own noses.\"Human noses have hundreds of receptors, each sensitive to one specific molecule,\" says Yao. \"They are vastly more sensitive and efficient than any mechanical or chemical device that could be engineered. We wondered how we could leverage the biological design itself rather than rely on a synthetic material.\"In other words, the team wondered if they could work with nature to sniff out disease\u2014and it turns out they have done just that.The answer begins with a bacterium known as Geobacter sulfurreducens, which Lovley and Yao previously used to create a biofilm capable of producing long-term, continuous electricity from your sweat. G. sulfurreducens' has the surprising natural ability to grow tiny, electrically conductive nanowires.But G. sulfurreducens is a finicky bacterium that needs specific conditions in which to grow, making it difficult to use at scale. \"What we've done,\" says Lovley, \"is to take the 'nanowire gene'\u2014called pilin\u2014out of G. sulfurreducens and splice it into the DNA of Escherichia coli, one of the most widespread bacteria in the world.\"                Nanowires, with their chemical-sniffing capabilities, are harvested and built into a sensor. Credit: Lekbach et al., 10.1016/j.bios.2023.115147             Once the pilin gene was removed from G. sulfurreducens, Lovley, Yao and team modified it so that it would include a specific peptide, known as DLESFL, which is extremely sensitive to ammonia\u2014a chemical often present in the breath of those with kidney disease. When they then spliced the modified pilin gene into E. coli's DNA, the genetically tweaked bacterium sprouted tiny nanowires bristling with the ammonia-sensing peptide. The team then harvested these ammonia-sensitive nanowires and built them into a sensor.\"Genetically modifying the nanowires made them 100 times more responsive to ammonia than they were originally,\" says Yassir Lekbach, the paper's co-lead author and a postdoctoral researcher in microbiology at UMass Amherst. \"The microbe-produced nanowires function much better as sensors than previously described sensors fabricated with traditional silicon or metal nanowires.\"And there's no need to limit these new sensors to only to ammonia and kidney disease. Toshiyuki Ueki, the paper's other co-lead author and research professor in microbiology at UMass Amherst, says that \"it's possible to design unique peptides, each of which specifically binds a molecule of interest. So, as more tracer molecules, emitted by the body and which are specific to particular a disease are identified, we can make sensors that incorporate hundreds of different chemical-sniffing nanowires to monitor all sorts of health conditions.\"      A new paradigm for electrical engineeringTraditional nanowires, made from silicon or carbon fiber, can be highly toxic\u2014carbon nanotubes are themselves carcinogens\u2014and end up as non-biodegradable e-waste. Their raw materials can require enormous amounts of energy and chemical inputs to harvest and process, as well as leaving a deep environmental impact. But because Lovley and Yao's nanowires are grown from common bacteria, they are far more sustainable.\"One of the most exciting things about this line of research,\" says Yao, \"is that we're taking electrical engineering in a fundamentally new direction. Instead of wires made from scarce raw resources that won't biodegrade, the beauty of these protein nanowires is that you can use life's genetic design to build a stable, versatile, low impact and cost-effective platform.\" More information:Yassir Lekbach et al, Microbial nanowires with genetically modified peptide ligands to sustainably fabricate electronic sensing devices, Biosensors and Bioelectronics (2023).

  "answer_squad": " triboelectric effect",
  "text": "Although many measures are in place to prevent contamination, pollutants such as mercury and lead can still end up in the environment. Sensing them often requires complicated processes, but what if you could detect them with the tap of a fingertip? Researchers reporting in ACS Nano have developed a self-powered nanosensor that can discover small amounts of mercury ions and immediately report the result.       Mercury in its Hg2+ form can be harmful if consumed through contaminated water or food, so researchers have developed various mercury sensors. One of these was integrated into a glove for on-site monitoring, but it couldn't detect the ion in small amounts and required a constant supply of external power.Instead, attention is now turning to self-powering systems, such as those driven by the triboelectric effect\u2014a form of static electricity. Not only does this generated electricity keep the device running, but its voltage can be used to signal the presence of a particular analyte. These devices are known as triboelectric nanosensors (TENS). So, Zong-Hong Lin and colleagues wanted to create a TENS that could accurately detect small amounts of mercury ions simply by touching a sample.To fabricate their TENS, the team used an array of mercury-sensitive tellurium nanowires. This made their sensor highly selective, allowing it to pick out its target even in complicated samples. The researchers mounted the TENS onto the fingertips of a robotic hand and repeatedly touched it into a sample solution. The change in voltage was wirelessly transmitted to a smartphone in real time, corresponding to the presence or absence of mercury ions.The robotic sensor also successfully detected ions in both naturally sourced and tap water with the same \"tapping\" method. It also detected them in food, including a shrimp and an apple, after they had been spiked with the contaminant. The researchers say that their TENS could serve as the basis for similar devices to monitor other pollutants remotely and safely.

  "text": "Micro/nanorobots with self-propelling and self-navigating capabilities have attracted extensive attention in from researchers in drug delivery and therapy due to their controllable locomotion in hard-to-reach body tissues.          However, developing self-adaptive micro/nanorobots that can adjust their driving mechanisms across multiple biological barriers to reach distant lesions is still a challenge.Recently, a research team led by Prof. Cai Lintao from the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has developed a twin-bioengine yeast micro/nanorobot (TBY-robot) with self-propelling and self-adaptive capabilities that can autonomously navigate to inflamed sites to provide gastrointestinal inflammation therapy via enzyme-macrophage switching (EMS).This study was published in Science Advances on Feb. 22.The researchers constructed the TBY-robot by asymmetrically immobilizing glucose oxidase and catalase onto the surface of anti-inflammatory nanoparticle-packaged yeast microcapsules. At a homogeneous glucose concentration, the Janus distribution of enzymes can catalyze the decomposition of glucose to generate a local glucose gradient that induces TBY-robot self-propelling motion.In the presence of an enteral glucose gradient, the oral TBY-robots move toward the glucose gradient to penetrate the intestinal mucus barrier and then cross the intestinal epithelial barrier by microfold cell transcytosis. \"We found that TBY-robots effectively penetrated the mucus barrier and notably enhanced their intestinal retention using a dual enzyme-driven engine moving toward the enteral glucose gradient,\" said Prof. Cai.

Credit: SIAT             After in situ switching to the macrophage bioengine in Peyer's patches, the TBY-robots autonomously migrate to inflamed sites of the gastrointestinal tract through chemokine-guided macrophage relay delivery. \"Encouragingly, TBY-robots increased drug accumulation at the diseased site by approximately 1000-fold, markedly attenuating inflammation and ameliorating disease pathology in mouse models of colitis and gastric ulcers,\" said Prof. Cai.This twin-bioengine delivery strategy is a sequence-driven process using EMS, with Peyer's patches as transfer stations. This process can precisely transport therapeutics across multiple biological barriers to distant, deep-seated disease sites.\"The transport route is similar to that of the Express Mail Service, which precisely delivers parcels to a distant destination using different transportation facilities,\" said Prof. Cai. These self-adaptive TBY-robots represent a safe and promising strategy for the precision treatment of gastrointestinal inflammation and other inflammatory diseases.

  "text": "Researchers from the Institute of Process Engineering (IPE) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Tsinghua University have developed a multifunctional hydrogel electrode with excellent conductivity, adhesion, and anti-interference properties, which can achieve high-quality wireless collection of prefrontal electroencephalography (EEG) signals.          The study was published in Advanced Materials on Jan. 9.High-quality EEG signals can be used for diagnosing and treating of brain-related diseases, as well as evaluating sustained attention levels.However, the existing EEG collection devices, with high power noise and poor anti-interference capability, are bulky and complex, and they can be easily interfered with the movement of the subjects, causing difficulty in collecting high-quality EEG signals.Moreover, the essential differences in electrical and mechanical characteristics between human tissue and sensing electrodes can lead to signal distortion. The hydrogel currently used in collection devices cannot resist interference factors such as sweat and motion artifacts, unsatisfying the demand for efficient collection.To solve the above issues, the research team used the nanoparticle-enhancement and homogenous network effect to develop a multifunctional hydrogel. \"It has the properties of excellent conductivity, adhesion, flexibility, elasticity, and biocompatibility, which can bridge the difference between human tissue and electrodes, and provide an efficient and stable conduction channel for EEG signal collection,\" said Prof. Bai Shuo from IPE.A free-radical oxidation degradation strategy was applied to prepare polydopamine nanoparticles that mimic the adhesive properties of mussels. During the process, the free radicals disrupted the \u03c0-stacking in polydopamine aggregates and promoted the conversion of indole units to pyrrole acid units, providing a stronger ion conductivity and tissue adhesion performance for the gel system. In addition, by controlling the cross-linking density, both low-stretch elasticity and high elasticity can be achieved.According to experiment data, sensing electrodes based on this hydrogel showed an excellent performance in terms of contact impedance and noise power, as well as long-term stability and good resistance to common interference factors such as sweat and motion artifacts.To further explore prediction accuracy, the researchers conducted a five-fold cross-validation experiment on EEG data from 24 volunteer subjects, with an accuracy of up to 91.5%.

Researchers at The University of Texas at Austin partnered with North Carolina-based company Smart Material Solutions Inc. to develop a new method to keep dust from sticking to surfaces. The result is the ability to make many types of materials dust resistant, from spacecraft to solar panels to household windows.The research is published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.\"What we've demonstrated here is a surface that can clean itself,\" said Chih-Hao Chang, an associate professor in the Cockrell School of Engineering's Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering and a lead author of the study. \"Particulates aren't able to stick to the surface, so they come off using just the force of gravity.\"In tests, the researchers piled lunar dust on top of their engineered surfaces and then turned each surface on its side. The result: Only about 2% of the surface remained dusty, compared with more than 35% of a similarly smooth surface.The researchers said the discovery boils down to things the human eye can't detect. In the experiments, the team altered the geometry of flat surfaces to create a tightly packed nanoscale network of pyramid-shaped structures. These sharp, angular structures make it difficult for the dust particles to stick to the material, instead sticking to one another and rolling off the material via gravity.Researchers at The University of Texas at Austin partnered with North Carolina-based company Smart Material Solutions Inc. to develop a new method to keep dust from sticking to surfaces. The result is the ability to make many types of materials dust resistant, from spacecraft to solar panels to household windows. Credit: The University of Texas at Austin/Smart Material SolutionsThese structures provide a passive solution, meaning they don't require any extra energy or materials to remove dust. Compare that with more active solutions such as a car windshield that requires the use of windshield wipers and wiper fluid to clean off dust.The research was funded via a grant from NASA's Small Business Innovation Research program, so the first applications focus on space technology. Space dust is especially pesky because of how high-risk everything becomes in that environment, and the conditions make cleaning off dust challenging. Dust wreaked havoc on the Apollo missions and has caused Mars rovers to fail.\"There's not much you can do about lunar dust in space\u2014it sticks to everything and there's no real way to wipe it off or spray it off,\" said Samuel Lee, a lead author who was an undergraduate researcher in Chang's group. \"Dust on solar panels of Mars rovers can cause them to fail.\"This technology also could have tremendous impact on Earth. It could prevent solar panels from collecting dust and losing efficiency over time. It could protect glass windows and someday even digital screens such as phones and TVs.Anti-dust technology has been around for decades, but it has not gained much traction outside of the lab because of scaling challenges. The researchers used fabrication concepts called nanocoining and nanoimprinting, which prints patterns on objects in a modernized version of the way newspapers and photographs were mass produced during the 1800s.

Durkin from the United States Naval Academy and Hanning Chen from the University of Texas at Austin, developed a Fe\u2212Fe double-atom catalyst, which they mixed with a peroxide and coronavirus strain in two different mediums: artificial saliva and freshwater drawn from a local river to mimic contact surface cleaning and water disinfection, respectively.Hear from GW researchers who helped develop a new nanomaterial that can boost the potency of common disinfectants. Credit: The George Washington UniversityThe researchers observed that the nanomaterial worked by shuttling electrons from the virus to the peroxide. As a result, the virus became oxidized, damaging the viral genome and proteins as well as the coronavirus lifecycle in the host cells.\"Our work paves a new avenue of leveraging advanced materials for improving disinfection, sanitation, and hygiene practices,\" said Zhe Zhou, first author on the paper and a Ph.D. candidate at GW. \"Our discovery also has broad engineering applications for advancing catalysis in pollution control, enabling effective and safe disinfection, controlling the environmental transmission of pathogens, and ultimately protecting public health.\"The nanomaterial could be scaled to deactivate environmental pathogens in diverse environments, the study's researchers said. Examples include water purification\u2014potentially packing the nanomaterial in columns and allowing water to pass through, purifying the water in the process. It can also be scaled to use in spray form to disinfect contact surfaces, like countertops.The researchers said future studies should focus on optimizing the materials to further advance the disinfection potency to achieve eco-friendly and robust disinfection to further protect public health.The findings are published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology.

  "text": "PCR technology is a molecular diagnostics technology that detects target nucleic acids by amplifying the DNA amount. It has brought marked progress in the life sciences field since its development in 1984.          This technology has recently become familiar to the public due to the COVID-19 pandemic, since PCR can detect nucleic acids that identify the COVID-19 virus. However, due to the technical nature of the PCR test, results cannot be immediately delivered. It takes at least one to two hours for the test as it requires repeated temperature cycles (60~95\u2103).Dr. Sang Kyung Kim and Dr. Seungwon Jung's research team at the Center for Augmented Safety System with Intelligence, Sensing of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) announced that they had developed an ultrafast PCR technology. By using photothermal nanomaterials, the ultrafast PCR shortens the test time by 10-fold, compared with the time taken for the existing test. The new method is completed in five minutes, with diagnostic performance equal to that of the existing test method.Photothermal nanomaterials generate heat immediately upon light irradiation. As such, photothermal nanomaterials rapidly increase in temperature, but it is difficult to maintain performance due to their low stability. The KIST research team has developed a polymer composite that physically holds photothermal nanomaterials and can overcome their instability.By applying it to a PCR system, they have successfully developed a compact PCR system without a heat plate. In addition, they implemented a multiplex diagnostic technology that detects several genes at once, enabling it to distinguish several types of COVID-19 variants in a single reaction.The work is published in the journal ACS Nano.

Credit: Korea Institute of Science and Technology             Director Sang Kyung Kim states, \"through additional research, we plan to miniaturize the developed ultrafast PCR technology this year, to develop a device that can be utilized anywhere. While maintaining the strength of PCR as an accurate diagnostic method, we will increase its convenience, field applicability, and promptness, by which we expect that it will become a precision diagnostic device that can be used at primary local clinics, pharmacies, and even at home. In addition, PCR technology is a universal molecular diagnostic technology that can be applied to various diseases other than infectious diseases, so it will become more applicable.\" More information:Bong Kyun Kim et al, Ultrafast Real-Time PCR in Photothermal Microparticles, ACS Nano (2022).

  "text": "Boron may be elemental, but it's certainly not basic. The 2D form of the element, called borophene, holds immense promise for application in energy, sensors and information storage, but more work is needed, according to a research team from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.          They published a review of recent work in borophene-based materials on Feb. 9 in Nano Research Energy.\"Borophene is a rising star monoelemental 2D material,\" said Guoan Tai, professor in the State Key Laboratory of Mechanics and Control of Mechanical Structures and the Laboratory of Intelligent Nano Materials and Devices of Ministry of Education, College of Aerospace Engineering in Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. \"Although many challenges exist in the experimental synthesis of borophene, it has made some exciting experimental progress in the fields of energy, sensing and information storage in recent years.\"According to Tai, borophene is predicted to have several unique physical and chemical properties, but there has been insufficient research to experimentally verify these characteristics. The predicted properties include mechanical compliance, optical transparency, ultrahigh thermal conductivity, superconductivity and more.\"Although borophene has realized continuous breakthroughs in theories and experiments, its related research started relatively late because of the complexity of its structure,\" Tai said, noting that stable 2D boron sheets were first reported in 1997. More stable versions were theorized and experimentally realized in the decades since. \"Compared with theoretical works on borophene, its synthesis experiments have lagged for a long time. In 2015, our group first reported the crystalline and stable monolayer boron sheets.\"The researchers found the borophene sheets demonstrated semiconductor properties. Additional work by various groups advanced the material\u2014and the desired properties\u2014further, but issues and challenges remain, Tai said.\"Although a series of breakthroughs have been made in the experimental synthesis of borophene-based materials in recent years, it is still difficult to obtain stable borophene-based materials with large area, single crystal and controllable thickness,\" Tai said, explaining these are desirable qualities because they make it easier to experimentally investigate theoretical properties.In addition to improving the quality of borophene-based materials, the researchers recommend dedicating efforts advancing studies focused on optimizing the material's performance in energy applications as well as for device integration and potential system development.\"There are few reviews comprehensively covering the experimental developments of borophene-based materials for application fields, especially energy, sensors and information storage,\" Tai said. \"Our hope is that by systematically summarizing the status of borophene-based applications, we will not only spark further exploration, but also inspire the research of borophene in other application fields.\" More information:Chuang Hou et al, Borophene-based materials for energy, sensors and information storage applications, Nano Research Energy (2023).

The carbon-based material improves, for instance, the conductivity and stability of composites.          Empa researchers are currently investigating the health risks of these comparatively new composite materials in several studies. The most recent are looking at the residues of graphene nanoplatelets that can be produced after the composites are burned in waste incinerators or in a fire accident.A realistic lung model in a cell culture dishSince the human organism is most likely to come into contact with graphene particles through the respiratory tract, the researchers used the 3D lung model developed at Empa with cell cultures for toxicity tests. The team led by Peter Wick of Empa's Particles-Biology Interactions laboratory in St. Gallen exposed lung cells to residues from the combustion of composite materials containing graphene nanoplatelets.To estimate the amount of graphene particles to which humans are typically exposed as realistically as possible, a team led by Jing Wang of Empa's Advanced Analytical Technologies laboratory examined and quantified the combustion residues of the graphene composites. Researchers from Empa's Advanced Fibers Laboratory were also involved in the interdisciplinary project.No acute damageUsing this data, the team subjected the 3D lung model to realistic conditions so that predictions could be made about the acute toxicity of graphene nanoplatelets after combustion. The results showed that combustion residues of plastic resins without graphene elicit well-known adverse reactions indicating a health risk. However, after contact with the graphene nanoplatelet residues, there was no further evidence of acute damage to lung cells, such as inflammatory reactions, oxidative stress or even cell death.In an earlier study, Empa researchers had already been able to show that the health risks of graphene dust produced by abrasion from polymer composites are negligible. The effects of prolonged exposure to graphene nanoparticles will now be investigated in long-term studies.

  "text": "If you watched the most recent Super Bowl, you know the importance of a referee's call on the outcome of a game. Slow-motion replays and close-watching eyes help, but a new sensor technology could someday serve as an even more reliable tool for officials. Researchers reporting in ACS Applied Nano Materials have developed a self-powered, hybrid nanogenerator sensor that could help make more accurate calls and allow boxers and cricket players to practice more efficiently.          As sensors become less complicated and more ubiquitous, their applications have stretched into the world of sports, where they can offer detailed analyses to referees, coaches and players. But these sensors need to be small, self-powered and relatively cheap to be feasible. Two technologies well suited for this are triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs).Both work by converting mechanical energy into electric energy, albeit in different ways. When combined into one hybrid nanogenerator, their individual shortcomings can be mitigated, but these devices have so far failed to find many practical applications. So, Nishat Kumar Das, Om Priya Nanda and Sushmee Badhulika from the Indian Institute of Technology wanted to create a sensor powered by a hybrid nanogenerator that could be used to monitor real-life performance in boxing and cricket.To manufacture their sensor, the researchers created nanofibers from lithium-modified zinc titanium oxide. These were layered with copper, a special kind of tape and other films with certain characteristics to create either a TENG or PENG. The PENG was mounted to a cricket bat and the stumps of a wicket\u2014used similarly to the bases in American baseball.If the ball contacted the sensors, it produced a voltage that could be used to determine a call. When used during practice, it provided data corresponding to the accuracy and power of the swing, with a response time of around 0.02 seconds. Then, they combined this PENG with a TENG to make a hybrid nanogenerator, four of which were then mounted to different parts of a punching bag.The devices distinguished between the six different types of punches used in boxing, as well as the speed of each, giving a player and their coach information about their style. The researchers say that this work could pave a way for exploring other applications for nanogenerators in sports.

  "text": "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) made by bridging metal-containing nodes with organic ligands are a type of ordered porous materials. The first case of MOFs reported by Yaghi et al. in 1995 sparked a frenzy in the research on MOFs. The past decade has witnessed the rapid development of such types of materials.       However, because of the limitation on material thickness, their applications in separation, catalysis, and biosensors are inevitably adversely affected. The preparation of two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin MOF nanosheets (also called metal-organic layers (MOLs)) could be an alternative to further enhance or extend the functionalities of MOFs.In MOLs, active centers are well exposed on the surface, which facilitates the interaction between vibrant centers and substrate molecules, thus, improving their applications in catalysis, gas separation, and sensing. The MOLs are commonly prepared by the top-down or bottom-up method.The top-down method uses physical or chemical means to exfoliate bulk MOFs into MOLs, whereas the bottom-up method synthesizes 2D MOLs by constraining the growth of MOLs in the third direction. Both methods have been extensively used to prepare 2D ultrathin MOLs with sub-10 nm thicknesses in the past decade.In this review, the authors thoroughly introduce and discuss the preparation and applications of the newly emerging 2D MOL materials. First, the authors summarize the two synthesis strategies for preparing 2D MOLs. Then, the authors discuss their applications in gas separation, catalysis, energy conversion, and sensing and analyze the relationship between their functions and structures. Finally, the authors present the challenges and opportunities for developing MOL materials in future.The work is published in the journal Science China Materials.

  "text": "Solar-thermal technology is a promising, environmentally friendly energy harvesting method with a potential role to play in solving the fossil fuel energy crisis.          The technology transforms sunlight into thermal energy, but it's challenging to suppress energy dissipation while maintaining high absorption. Existing solar energy harvesters that rely on micro- or nanoengineering don't have sufficient scalability and flexibility, and will require a novel strategy for high-performance solar light capture while simultaneously simplifying fabrication and reducing costs.In the article \"Scalable selective absorber with quasi-periodic nanostructure for low-grade solar energy harvesting,\" published in APL Photonics, researchers from Harbin University, Zhejiang University, Changchun Institute of Optics, and the National University of Singapore designed a solar harvester with enhanced energy conversion capabilities.The device employs a quasiperiodic nanoscale pattern\u2014meaning most of it is an alternating and consistent pattern, while the remaining portion contains random defects (unlike a nanofabricated structure) that do not affect its performance. In fact, loosening the strict requirements on the periodicity of the structure significantly increases the device's scalability.The fabrication process makes use of self-assembling nanoparticles, which form an organized material structure based on their interactions with nearby particles without any external instructions.Thermal energy harvested by the device can be transformed to electricity using thermoelectric materials.\"Solar energy is transferred as an electromagnetic wave within a broad frequency range,\" said author Ying Li of Zhejiang University. \"A good solar-thermal harvester should be able to absorb the wave and get hot, thereby converting solar energy into thermal energy. The process requires a high absorbance (100% is perfect), and a solar harvester should also suppress its thermal radiation to preserve the thermal energy, which requires a low thermal emissivity (zero means no radiation).\"To achieve these goals, a harvester is usually a system with a periodic nanophotonic structure. But the flexibility and scalability of these modules can be limited due to the rigidity of the pattern and high fabrication costs.\"Unlike previous strategies, our quasiperiodic nanophotonic structure is self-assembled by iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles, rather than cumbersome and costly nanofabrication,\" said Li.Their quasiperiodic nanophotonic structure achieves high absorbance (greater than 94%), suppressed thermal emissivity (less than 0.2), and under natural solar illumination, the absorber features a fast and significant temperature rise (greater than 80 degrees Celsius).Based on the absorber, the team built a flexible planar solar thermoelectric harvester, which reached a significant sustaining voltage of over 20 millivolts per square centimeter. They expect it to power 20 light-emitting diodes per square meter of solar irradiation. This strategy can serve low-power density applications for more flexible and scalable engineering of solar energy harvesting.\"We hope our quasiperiodic nanophotonic structure will inspire other work,\" said Li. \"This highly versatile structure and our fundamental research can be used to explore the upper limit of solar energy harvesting, such as flexible scalable solar thermoelectric generators, which can serve as an assistant solar harvesting component to increase the total efficiency of photovoltaic architectures.\" More information:Scalable selective absorber with quasi-periodic nanostructure for low-grade solar energy harvesting, APL Photonics (2023).

  "text": "In a new study, researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) show how a brain-inspired image sensor can go beyond the diffraction limit of light to detect miniscule objects such as cellular components or nanoparticles invisible to current microscopes. Their novel technique, which combines optical microscopy with a neuromorphic camera and machine learning algorithms, presents a major step forward in pinpointing objects smaller than 50 nanometers in size. The results are published in Nature Nanotechnology.          Since the invention of optical microscopes, scientists have strived to surpass a barrier called the diffraction limit, which means that the microscope cannot distinguish between two objects if they are smaller than a certain size (typically 200-300 nanometers).Their efforts have largely focused on either modifying the molecules being imaged, or developing better illumination strategies\u2014some of which led to the 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. \"But very few have actually tried to use the detector itself to try and surpass this detection limit,\" says Deepak Nair, Associate Professor at the Center for Neuroscience (CNS), IISc, and corresponding author of the study.Measuring roughly 40 mm (height) by 60 mm (width) by 25 mm (diameter), and weighing about 100 grams, the neuromorphic camera used in the study mimics the way the human retina converts light into electrical impulses, and has several advantages over conventional cameras. In a typical camera, each pixel captures the intensity of light falling on it for the entire exposure time that the camera focuses on the object, and all these pixels are pooled together to reconstruct an image of the object.In neuromorphic cameras, each pixel operates independently and asynchronously, generating events or spikes only when there is a change in the intensity of light falling on that pixel. This generates sparse and lower amount of data compared to traditional cameras, which capture every pixel value at a fixed rate, regardless of whether there is any change in the scene.This functioning of a neuromorphic camera is similar to how the human retina works, and allows the camera to \"sample\" the environment with much higher temporal resolution\u2014because it is not limited by a frame rate like normal cameras\u2014and also perform background suppression.                View of the microscopy setup. Credit: Rohit Mangalwedhekar             \"Such neuromorphic cameras have a very high dynamic range (>120 dB), which means that you can go from a very low-light environment to very high-light conditions. The combination of the asynchronous nature, high dynamic range, sparse data, and high temporal resolution of neuromorphic cameras make them well-suited for use in neuromorphic microscopy,\" explains Chetan Singh Thakur, Assistant Professor at the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering (DESE), IISc, and co-author.In the current study, the group used their neuromorphic camera to pinpoint individual fluorescent beads smaller than the limit of diffraction, by shining laser pulses at both high and low intensities, and measuring the variation in the fluorescence levels. As the intensity increases, the camera captures the signal as an \"ON\" event, while an \"OFF\" event is reported when the light intensity decreases. The data from these events were pooled together to reconstruct frames.To accurately locate the fluorescent particles within the frames, the team used two methods. The first was a deep learning algorithm, trained on about one and a half million image simulations that closely represented the experimental data, to predict where the centroid of the object could be, explains Rohit Mangalwedhekar, former research intern at CNS and first author of the study. A wavelet segmentation algorithm was also used to determine the centroids of the particles separately for the ON and the OFF events. Combining the predictions from both allowed the team to zero in on the object's precise location with greater accuracy than existing techniques.\"In biological processes like self-organization, you have molecules that are alternating between random or directed movement, or that are immobilized,\" explains Nair. \"Therefore, you need to have the ability to locate the center of this molecule with the highest precision possible so that we can understand the thumb rules that allow the self-organization.\"The team was able to closely track the movement of a fluorescent bead moving freely in an aqueous solution using this technique. This approach can, therefore, have widespread applications in precisely tracking and understanding stochastic processes in biology, chemistry and physics.

  "text": "Semiconductors are foundational components of modern energy, communication, and myriad other technologies. Research on tailoring the underlying nanostructure of semiconductors for optimizing device performance has been ongoing for decades.          Now, in a study recently published in Scientific Reports, researchers from the University of Tsukuba and collaborating partner UNISOKU Co., LTD., have developed an easy-to-use, time-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) for measuring the movement of electrons in nanostructures at high temporal and spatial resolution, in a manner that will be invaluable for optimizing nanostructure performance.Current flow through semiconductors, and thus their performance, depends on the dynamics of charge carriers. These dynamics can be extremely fast. For example, their dynamics can be more than 10 billion times faster than the millisecond range of the blink of an eye. Optical pump-probe (OPP) STM is the present state-of-the-art, essential method for measuring and imaging such dynamics in semiconductors.However, present means of measuring and imaging systems are too complicated for non-experts. Special techniques are needed for data acquisition and interpretation. Therefore, ease of operation and ease of use are what the researchers sought to address in this study.\"OPP STM is an essential method for measuring photo-induced charge carrier dynamics in nanostructures, but requires technical advances to meet ultrafast observation needs,\" explains Professor Hidemi Shigekawa, senior author. \"Our updates to OPP STM enabled study of ultrafast carrier dynamics in a common semiconducting material.\"The researchers report particularly noteworthy techniques that helped optimize the performance of the developed system. They introduced a mechanism to electrically control the laser oscillation as well as the delay time between the pump and probe lights, and constructed a stable optical system. They used this user-friendly system to measure ultrafast charge carrier dynamics on gallium arsenide surfaces.They also succeeded in applying their technique to correlate defects such as step edges and terraces to charge carrier dynamics. This correlation was enabled in part by the high stability of the imaging, meaning that it was conducted on a stabilized light spot position over 16 hours.\"Our work will be invaluable in fields such as ultrafast optical communication technologies and photocatalysis,\" say the researchers. \"Relating the underlying nanostructure of materials to corresponding photo-electrical properties by this user-friendly method will provide fundamental knowledge that's necessary for improving semiconductor device functionality.\"This work succeeded in expanding the utility of OPP STM for studying nanostructure-function relationships of semiconducting materials such as gallium arsenide and low-dimensional materials. The researchers' straightforward experimental design will help researchers in various fields improve the photo-electrical performance of, for example, integrated circuits and light-emitting diodes for ultrafast optical communication technologies. The performance of time-resolved OPP STM can be further improved by optimizing the wavelength and temporal width of the pulsed laser, and substantial developments are expected.

  "text": "Researchers from the Disruptive & Sustainable Technologies for Agricultural Precision (DiSTAP) Interdisciplinary Research Group (IRG) of Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART), MIT's research enterprise in Singapore and their collaborators from Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory (TLL) have developed the first ever nanosensor that can detect and distinguish gibberellins (GAs), a class of hormones in plants that are important for growth.          The novel nanosensors are non-destructive, unlike conventional collection methods, and have been successfully tested in living plants. Applied in the field for early-stage plant stress monitoring, the sensors could prove transformative for agriculture and plant biotechnology, giving farmers interested in high-tech precision agriculture and crop management a valuable tool to optimize yield.The researchers designed near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent carbon nanotube sensors that are capable of detecting and distinguishing two plant hormones, GA3 and GA4. Belonging to a class of plant hormones known as gibberellins (GAs), GA3 and GA4 are diterpenoid phytohormones produced by plants that play an important role in modulating diverse processes involved in plant growth and development.GAs are thought to have played a role in the driving forces behind the 'green revolution' of the 1960s, which was in turn credited with averting famine and saving the lives of many worldwide. The continued study of gibberellins could lead to further breakthroughs in agricultural science and have implications for food security.Climate change, global warming and rising sea levels cause farming soil to get contaminated by saltwater, raising soil salinity. In turn, high soil salinity is known to negatively regulate GA biosynthesis and promote GA metabolism, resulting in the reduction of GA content in plants.The new nanosensors developed by the SMART researchers allow for the study of GA dynamics in living plants under salinity stress at a very early stage, potentially enabling farmers to make early interventions when eventually applied in the field. This forms the basis of early-stage stress detection.Currently, methods to detect GA3 and GA4 typically require mass spectroscopy-based analysis, a time-consuming and destructive process. In contrast, the new sensors developed by the researchers are highly selective for the respective GAs and offer real-time, in vivo monitoring of changes in GA levels across a broad range of plant species.      Described in a paper published in Nano Letters, the research represents a breakthrough for early-stage plant stress detection and holds tremendous potential to advance plant biotechnology and agriculture. This paper builds on previous research by the team at SMART DiSTAP on single-walled carbon nanotube-based (SWNT-based) nanosensors using the corona phase molecular recognition (CoPhMoRe) platform.Based on the CoPhMoRe concept pioneered by the Strano Lab at MIT, the novel sensors are able to detect GA kinetics in the roots of a variety of model and non-model plant species, including Arabidopsis, lettuce and basil, as well as GA accumulation during lateral root emergence, highlighting the importance of GA in root system architecture.This was made possible by the researchers' related development of a new coupled Raman/NIR fluorimeter that enables self-referencing of nanosensor NIR fluorescence with its Raman G-band, a new hardware innovation that removes the need for a separate reference nanosensor and greatly simplifies the instrumentation requirements by using a single optical channel to measure hormone concentration.Using the reversible GA nanosensors, the researchers detected increased endogenous GA levels in mutant plants producing greater amounts of GA20ox1, a key enzyme in GA biosynthesis, as well as decreased GA levels in plants under salinity stress. When exposed to salinity stress, researchers also found that lettuce growth was severely stunted\u2014an indication that only became apparent after 10 days.In contrast, the GA nanosensors reported decreased GA levels after just 6 hours, demonstrating their efficacy as a much earlier indicator of salinity stress.\"Our CoPhMoRe technique allows us to create nanoparticles that act like natural antibodies in that they can recognize and lock onto specific molecules. But they tend to be far more stable than alternatives. We have used this method to successfully create nanosensors for plant signals such as hydrogen peroxide and heavy-metal pollutants like arsenic in plants and soil. The method works to create sensors for organic molecules like synthetic auxin\u2014an important plant hormone\u2014as we have shown. This latest breakthrough now extends this success to a plant hormone family called gibberellins\u2014an exceedingly difficult one to recognize,\" said co-corresponding author, DiSTAP co-lead Principal Investigator Professor Michael Strano and Carbon P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT.\"The resulting technology offers a rapid, real-time, and in vivo method to monitor changes in GA levels in virtually any plant, and can replace current sensing methods which are laborious, destructive, species-specific and much less efficient.\"Dr. Mervin Chun-Yi Ang, Associate Scientific Director at DiSTAP and co-first author of the paper, added, \"More than simply a breakthrough in plant stress detection, we have also demonstrated a hardware innovation in the form of a new coupled Raman/NIR fluorimeter that enabled self-referencing of SWNT sensor fluorescence with its Raman G-band, representing a major advance in the translation of our nanosensing toolsets to the field.\"\"In the near future, our sensors can be combined with low-cost electronics, portable optodes, or microneedle interfaces for industrial use, transforming how the industry screens for and mitigates plant stress in food crops and potentially improving growth and yield.\"The new sensors could yet have a variety of industrial applications and use cases. As TLL principal investigator, NUS Adjunct Assistant Professor Daisuke Urano and co-corresponding author of the paper explained, \"GAs are known to regulate a wide range of plant development processes, from shoot, root, and flower development, to seed germination and plant stress responses. With the commercialisation of GAs, these plant hormones are also sold to growers and farmers as plant growth regulators to promote plant growth and seed germination. Our novel GA nanosensors could be applied in the field for early-stage plant stress monitoring, and also be used by growers and farmers to track the uptake or metabolism of GA in their crops.\"The design and development of the nanosensors, creation and validation of the coupled Raman/NIR fluorimeter and related image/data processing algorithms, as well as statistical analysis of readouts from plant sensors for this study was done by SMART and MIT; while TLL was responsible for the design, execution and analysis of plant-related studies, including validation of nanosensors in living plants.

  "text": "At the heart of every mobile phone, laptop and autonomous vehicle is a tiny semiconductor whose properties and, ultimately, performance are determined by free electrons. Now, UC Berkeley researchers have developed a new way to measure these electrons that could lead to more energy-efficient semiconductor materials and electronics.          As reported in Nano Letters, researchers demonstrated a new type of optical nanoscopy that can measure electron dynamics in semiconductors, a task that has become more challenging as demand grows for ever-smaller and faster integrated circuits. With the components of many everyday electronic devices already at nanoscale, new tools are needed to measure electrons with high resolution.\"Our optical nanoscopy integrates near-field scanning optical microscopy and pump-probe optics to enable high resolution at both spatial and temporal scales,\" said Costas Grigoropoulos, professor of mechanical engineering and principal investigator of the study. \"And this technology can be applied to a wide range of semiconductor materials, including silicon, germanium and gallium arsenide as well as other exotic materials, such as 2D materials and ferroelectrics.\"In other words, the optical nanoscopy tool uses a combination of optical imaging and laser probing technologies to measure electrons, or energy carriers, at picosecond and nanometer scales. These measurements may offer insights into how energy carriers are distributed and the way they behave within semiconductor materials, which can impact energy efficiency and other properties.According to Jingang Li, lead author and a postdoctoral researcher in Grigoropoulos's Laser Thermal Lab, this research represents an important step toward investigating and further optimizing energy savings for semiconductor-based electronic devices\u2014such as mobile phones, LEDs, industrial solar cells and sensors.\"With a high density of chips in integrated circuits, the electron distribution and transport not only control the device functionality, but also govern the heat generation and dissipation process,\" said Li. \"Our nanoscopy will enable the investigation of nanoscale thermal management in these densely packed devices.\"To measure the electrons in a semiconductor, optical nanoscopy employs ultrafast lasers and an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip with an apex curvature of less than 30 nanometers. Researchers shine two laser beams\u2014a pump beam and then a probe beam\u2014onto the AFM tip. The first beam excites electrons in the sample, and after a carefully timed delay, the second beam strikes the tip. Then, the local information on electron properties can be obtained by analyzing the scattered light of the second beam.Li thinks that optical nanoscopy may have applications beyond measuring electrons in semiconductor materials. \"Because it's a versatile optical diagnostic tool, it can be used to study many other physical phenomena and functional devices, such as phase transitions and data storage,\" he said.

  "text": "Researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Department of Chemistry have engineered silicon nanowires that can convert sunlight into electricity by splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen gas, a greener alternative to fossil fuels.          Fifty years ago, scientists first demonstrated that liquid water can be split into oxygen and hydrogen gas using electricity produced by illuminating a semiconductor electrode. Although hydrogen generated using solar power is a promising form of clean energy, low efficiencies and high costs have hindered the introduction of commercial solar-powered hydrogen plants.An economic feasibility analysis suggests that using a slurry of electrodes made from nanoparticles instead of a rigid solar panel design could substantially lower costs, making solar-produced hydrogen competitive with fossil fuels. However, most existing particle-based light-activated catalysts, also referred to as photocatalysts, can absorb only ultraviolet radiation, limiting their energy-conversion efficiency under solar illumination.James Cahoon, Ph.D., Hyde Family Foundation Professor of Chemistry in UNC-Chapel Hill's College of Arts and Sciences, and his colleagues in the department have been working on the chemical synthesis of semiconductor nanomaterials with unique physical properties that can enable a range of technologies, from solar cells to solid-state memory. Cahoon serves as the corresponding author of the findings published Feb. 9 in Nature.Cahoon and his team designed new silicon nanowires to have multiple solar cells along their axis so that they could produce the power needed to split water.\"This design is unprecedented in previous reactor designs and allows silicon to be used for the first time in a PSR,\" explained Taylor Teitsworth, a postdoctoral research associate in Cahoon's lab.Silicon absorbs both visible and infrared light. It has historically been a top choice for solar cells, also referred to as photovoltaic cells and semiconductors, owing to this and other properties\u2014including its abundance, low toxicity and stability. With its electronic properties, the only way to drive water splitting wirelessly with silicon particles is to encode multiple photovoltaic cells in each particle. This can be achieved by generating particles that contain multiple interfaces, called junctions, between two different forms of silicon\u2014p-type and n-type semiconductors.Previously, Cahoon's research focused on a bottom-up synthesis and spatially controlled modulation of silicone with boron for p-type nanowires and with phosphorus for n-type nanowires to impart desirable geometries and functionalities.\"We used this approach to create a new class of water-splitting multijunction nanoparticles. These combine the material and economic advantages of silicon with the photonic advantages of nanowires that have a diameter smaller than the wavelength of absorbed light,\" said Cahoon. \"Owing to the inherent asymmetry of the wire junctions, we were able to use a light-driven electrochemical method to deposit the co-catalysts selectively onto the ends of the wires to enable water splitting.\" More information:Taylor S.

  "answer_squad": " the cuticle",
  "text": "A project led by Ella Hudson, Ph.D. Researcher at The University of Sheffield, seeks to ascertain the contribution of the hair cuticle to the mechanical properties of the whole fiber.          The objective of this work was to ascertain if a novel haircare treatment could restore the nanomechanical properties of the cuticle of hair fibers following a damaging treatment and also to investigate the effect of hair type (ethnicity). To achieve this the cuticular nanomechanical properties of hair were investigated in three states, with samples of two different types of hair: African and Caucasian, which is typical for the literature in this field:Untreated (healthy) hair,Damaged hair, andDamaged hair treated with the novel treatment.Under investigation was the contribution of the cuticle (surface layer) to the mechanical properties of a whole fiber. However, the techniques that are typically used to study the mechanical properties of hair generate data representative of the entire fiber (Yu et al. 2017). Nanoindentation enables the localized measurement of hardness properties of only the surface of samplesHair fibers are hierarchically organized and consist of three basic structural units: i) a protective outer layer called the cuticle, ii) a central core called the cortex, and, in some instances, iii) a porous channel called the medulla.The Nanoindentation data showed no significant differences between the treatment groups for either African or Caucasian hair. These results differ from whole-fiber mechanical testing which show clear treatment differences, this clearly indicates that the internal structures of hair fibers (the cortex and the medulla) respond the most to the damaging and restorative treatments, and not the cuticle.The comparison between African and Caucasian hair types for all three treatment groups (untreated, damaged, and restored) showed that that the cuticle layer of the African hair sample had higher reduced elastic modulus and hardness values than the Caucasian sample, which demonstrates the innate cuticle differences as a function of hair type.Previous work by Ella on the mechanical properties of hair fibers focused on the analysis of population variation and how that can change following different treatments was reinforced by the Nanoindentation data. In general, damaging treatments reduce the variation compared to untreated hair. The novel restorative haircare treatment does appear to restore this population variance towards the pre-damaged state, in agreement with the mechanical property data collected on whole-fibers.Noticed in the data was the interesting phenomena that, following the application of the novel treatment to damaged hair, there was bimodal distribution not seen in the untreated or damaged hair groups. There is currently no definitive explanation to this, but may be due to the innate differences between individual hair fibers, for example, the presence of a medulla.Ella intends to to continue to characterize hair in different damage states and investigate the efficacy of restorative treatments.

  "text": "Prof. Wang Hui, together with Prof. Lin Wenchu and associate Prof. Qian Junchao from the Hefei Institutes of Physical Science (HFIPS) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, have recently reported a near infrared (NIR)-II-responsive carbon-coated iron oxide nanocluster that was guided by magnetic resonance imaging and capable of combined photothermal and chemodynamic therapy (CDT), for synergistic cancer treatment.          The results were published in SCIENCE CHINA Materials.As a promising treatment strategy, CDT has become a hot spot in cancer research due to its simple operation and low side effects. The basic principle of CDT is that the nanozymes activate the intracellular Fenton reaction, leading to the over-production of hydroxyl radicals, which are toxic to cancer cells. Magnetite nanocrystals are widely used as Fenton reagents due to their non-invasive imaging ability and good biocompatibility. However, the ferromagnetic behavior and easy oxidization of magnetite nanocrystals lead to colloidal instability as nanozymes and limit the imaging-guided cancer therapy in practical applications.In this study, the researchers used a one-step solvothermal method to produce carbon-coated magnetite nanoclusters (CCMNCs) with optical absorption in the NIR-II (1,000\u20131,100 nm) by tuning the cluster structure and carbon coating of magnetite nanocrystals.\"The CCMNCs possess superparamagnetic nature and fast magnetic response for separation, enabling them to be used as a contrast agent for T2-weighted MRI,\" said Wang Hui, who led the team.He further explained how the CCMNCs worked. Fe2+ and Fe3+ were found in the dissolution of CCMNCs in tumor microenvironment. Fe2+ produced \u00b7OH in situ in cells and mice, which in turn killed cancer cells and inhibited tumor growth through CDT effects. Fe3+ could reduce intracellular glutathione levels and enhance the deleterious effects caused by \u00b7OH, thus improving CDT efficiency.They concluded that the CCMNCs could effectively absorb and convert NIR-II irradiation into cytotoxic heat, enhancing tumor CDT efficiency and producing synergistic therapeutic effects.

  "text": "A research team from LKS Faculty of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong (HKUMed) has developed thyroid hormone (TH)\u2013encapsulated nanoparticles modified with an adipose-homing peptide, which selectively transports TH to adipose tissues. This will advance the treatment of obesity-related medical complications with TH by overcoming the severe adverse effects caused by systemic administration. The new findings are now published in Nature Communications.          Obesity is a major risk factor for multiple life-threatening chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. TH is an ancient hormone with therapeutic potential for obesity and its related medical complications by promoting energy expenditure. However, despite enormous research efforts in the past decades, clinical trials have failed to demonstrate obvious clinical benefits of chronic systemic administration of TH on weight loss in obese individuals.Furthermore, due to widespread expression of TH receptors, systemic administration of TH often leads to serious deleterious effects on multiple organs, including tachycardia, heart attack, muscle wasting, and osteoporosis. Skeletal muscle and adipose tissues are thought to be the two major target organs where TH exerts its stimulatory actions on metabolic rate and energy expenditure. However, whether selective delivery of TH to adipose tissues is sufficient to induce weight loss remains unclear.The research team developed TH-encapsulated nanoparticles, modified with an adipose-homing peptide to selectively deliver TH to adipose tissues. Remarkably, the researchers found that adipose-targeted delivery of TH is substantially more potent than systemic TH therapy in reducing obesity and its related metabolic complications, with no adverse effect on other non-adipose tissues.Mechanistically, the study uncovered that adipose-targeted TH therapy can convert \"bad\" white fat to \"good\" brown fat, which can burn calories by creating heat, whereas systemic TH therapy is unable to induce \"browning\" of white fat due to its suppression of sympathetic nerves. Furthermore, the research team made an unexpected finding that adipose-targeted delivery of TH effectively alleviates hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis, major causes of coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke.\"This is the first proof-of-concept study showing that nanoparticle-based targeted delivery of TH to adipose tissue is an effective and safe pharmacotherapy for obesity and its related cardiometabolic complications. The findings have also resolved a long-standing mystery of why systemic TH therapy failed to reduce body weight, thus reigniting the hope of using this ancient hormone for treatment of common chronic diseases through nanoparticle-based precision target delivery,\" said Professor Xu Aimin, Director of State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology and Professor of Department of Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, HKUMed.

  "text": "Physicists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have directly measured the fluid-like flow of electrons in graphene at nanometer resolution for the first time. The results appear in the journal Science today.          Graphene, an atom-thick sheet of carbon arranged in a honeycomb pattern, is an especially pure electrical conductor, making it an ideal material to study electron flow with very low resistance. Here, researchers intentionally add impurities at known distances, and find that electron flow changes from gas-like to fluid-like as the temperature rises.\"All conductive materials contain impurities and imperfections that block electron flow, which causes resistance. Historically, people have taken a low-resolution approach to identifying where resistance comes from,\" says Zach Krebs, a physics graduate student at UW-Madison and co-lead author of the study. \"In this study, we image how charge flows around an impurity and actually see how that impurity blocks current and causes resistance, which is something that hasn't been done before to distinguish gas-like and fluid-like electron flow.\"The results have applications in developing new, low-resistance materials, where electrical transport would be more efficient.The study used a technique known as scanning tunneling potentiometry (STP) and the 2D material graphene. The researchers intentionally introduced obstacles in the graphene, spaced at controlled distances, and then applied a current across the sheet. Using STP, they measured the voltage with nanometer resolution at all points on the graphene, producing a 2D map of the electron flow pattern (higher voltage = more electrons). No matter the obstacle spacing, the drop in voltage through the channel was much lower at a higher temperature (77 Kelvin) vs. a lower temperature (4 Kelvin), indicating more electrons were passing through (lower resistance).\"We did a quantitative analysis [of the voltage map] and found that at the higher temperature, the resistance is much lower in the channel. The electrons were flowing more freely and fluid-like,\" Krebs says. \"Graphene is so clean that we're forcing the electrons to interact with each other before they interact with anything else, and that is crucial in getting them to behave like a fluid.\"The rock and stream analogyAt temperatures near absolute zero, electrons in graphene behave like a gas: they diffuse in all directions and are more likely to hit obstacles than they are to interact with each other. Resistance is higher, and electron flow is relatively inefficient.At higher temperatures\u201477 K, or minus 196 C\u2014the fluid-like behavior of electron flow means they are interacting with each other more than they are hitting obstacles, flowing like water between two rocks in the middle of a stream. It is as if the electrons are communicating information about the obstacle to each other and diverting around the rocks. Resistance is lower, and electron flow is more efficient.Former UW-Madison graduate student Wyatt Behn is a co-first author on this study, conducted in physics professor Victor Brar's group.

  "answer_squad": " Co-Pt alloy nanocatalysts",
  "text": "A fuel cell is an electric power generator that is capable of producing electricity from hydrogen gas while discharging only water as a waste product. It is hoped that this highly efficient clean energy system will play a key role in the adoption of the hydrogen economy, replacing the combustion engines and batteries in automobiles and trucks, as well as power plants.          However, the cost of platinum, which can be up to ~30,000 USD per kg, has been a major limitation, making fuel cell catalysts prohibitively expensive. The production methods of highly-performing catalysts have also been complicated and largely limited. Accordingly, the development of a facile and scalable production method for platinum-based fuel cell catalysts is an urgent challenge, together with enhancing catalytic performance and stability while using a minimum amount of platinum.To tackle this issue, a research team led by Prof. Sung Yung-Eun and Prof. Hyeon Taeghwan at the Center for Nanoparticle Research (CNR) within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS), South Korea has discovered a novel method for the production of nanocatalysts.The researchers demonstrated that these uniformly sized (3-4 nanometers) cobalt-platinum (Co-Pt) alloy nanoparticles can be produced by simple heat treatment. This method has combined features of the ease of the synthesis of the impregnation method, along with the precise control over the size and shape of the nanocrystals similar to the colloidal method.The novel Co-Pt alloy nanocatalysts developed by the CNR-IBS team consist of two oppositely-charged metal complexes, specifically Co and Pt ions surrounded by bipyridine and chlorine ligands, respectively.The research team hypothesized that a simple heat treatment would cause the bipyridine ligand to thermally decompose into a carbon shell that can protect the growing Co-Pt alloy nanoparticles. After optimizing the heat treatment condition, they succeeded in obtaining a highly uniform nanocatalyst with nanoparticles of only 3-4 nanometer sizes.                Schematic illustration of the growth process of the Co-Pt alloy nanocatalyst. Simple heat treatment at 900 \u00b0C could produce atomically ordered Co-Pt nanoparticles on a carbon support. Credit: Institute for Basic Science             In the nanocatalyst developed by the group, Co and Pt atoms were arranged in a regular way called the 'intermetallic phase', where the unstable Co atoms are stabilized by the surrounding Pt atoms. Additionally, when nitrogen was effectively doped onto the carbon support, ionomers (proton conductors) were homogeneously dispersed over the entire catalyst layer in the fuel cell, which better facilitated the supply of oxygen gas to the surface of the Co-Pt nanocatalyst.      These structural features added up to a much-enhanced power performance in the proton-exchange-membrane fuel cell, exhibiting high specific rated power of 5.9 kW/gPt, which is about twice that of the current performance in a commercial hydrogen vehicle. The catalyst produced by the team has achieved most of the 2025 targets set by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) with the goal of stable long-term operation of the fuel cell.The CNR-IBS team strongly believes that this study would stimulate the development of next-generation fuel cell catalysts. These findings would also contribute to the improvements in the catalytic performance and durability of alloy nanocatalysts for various other electrocatalytic applications.Prof. Hyeon said, \"Design of a novel bimetallic compound as a precursor material has been the critical starting point in this study. We have developed a platform technology to produce a complicated form of alloy nanocatalysts through a simple and scalable method, and finally achieved an enhanced fuel cell power performance with less amount of platinum used.\"Prof. Sung said, \"A world-class level of fuel cell performance has been achieved in this research, surpassing most of the 2025 targets of U.S. DOE by lessening the amount of platinum that can contribute up to around 40% of the cost of fuel cells.\" He added, \"We expect that this study, together with some follow-up studies, would greatly impact the growth of the hydrogen vehicle industry and the realization of hydrogen economy in the near future.\"The study is published in the journal Energy & Environmental Science.

Some estimates suggest  only 5% is actually being recycled.\"Waste plastic is rarely recycled because it costs a lot of money to do all the washing, sorting and melting down of the plastics to turn it into a material that can be used by a factory,\" said Kevin Wyss, a Rice graduate student and lead author on  a study published in  Advanced Materials that describes how he and colleagues in the lab of chemist James Tour used their flash Joule heating technique to turn plastic into valuable carbon nanotubes and hybrid nanomaterials.\"We were able to make a hybrid carbon nanomaterial that outperformed both graphene and commercially available carbon nanotubes,\" Wyss said.Graphene, carbon nanotubes and other carbon-based nanomaterials are generally strong and chemically robust, have low density and lots of surface area, and possess conductivity and broadband electromagnetic absorption abilities. This makes them useful in a variety of industrial, medical and electronics applications such as composites, coatings, sensors, electrochemical energy storage and more.

These are normally really hard to make, and the fact that we were able to make them out of waste plastic is really special.\"The structure of the new hybrid carbon nanomaterial is responsible for its enhanced performance.\"Let's say I was trying to pull a string of yarn out of a sweater,\" Wyss said. \"If the string is straight and smooth, it can come out quite easily sometimes and ruin the weave. It's the same with the carbon nanotubes; having these masses of graphene attached at the ends helps make them much harder to remove, thereby strengthening the composite.      \"You can also think of it this way: If you get a splinter, it's easy to take out. But if you get pricked with something that has a curve on the end, like a fishing hook, it's a lot harder to take out,\" he added.The plastic, which does not need to be sorted or washed as in traditional recycling, is \"flashed\" at temperatures over 3,100 Kelvin (about 5,120 degrees Fahrenheit). \"All we do is grind the material into small, confetti-sized pieces, add a bit of iron and mix in a small amount of a different carbon\u2014say, charcoal\u2014for conductivity,\" Wyss said.

When used in composites, these hybrid morphologies performed better than either graphene or carbon nanotubes alone. Credit: Tour lab/Rice University             \"Recycling plastic costs more than just producing new plastic,\" he added. \"There's very little economic incentive to recycle plastic. That's why we turned to upcycling, or turning low-value waste materials into something with a higher monetary or use value. If we can turn waste plastic into something more valuable, then people can make money off of being responsible in how they deal with discarded plastics.\"A life cycle analysis of the production process revealed that flash Joule heating was considerably more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly than existing nanotube production processes.\"Compared to commercial methods for carbon nanotube production that are being used right now, ours uses about 90% less energy and generates 90%-94% less carbon dioxide,\" Wyss said.Tour, a co-author on the study, is the T.

  "text": "Electro-thermal therapy, which involves applying electrical signals to nanomaterials, provides high cancer cell targeting accuracy and is highly bio-compatible. In this research, scientists from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) have designed a novel thermal-based therapy nano-system that destroys more than 20% of pancreatic cancer cells using microsecond electrical pulses and with excellent bio-compatibility.          Electro-thermal therapy works by injecting two dimensional (2D) materials in cancer cells and applying electrical currents to the cells. This causes the materials to heat up and kill neighboring cancer cells. Traditional electro-thermal therapy with 2D materials however, can fail as a result of weak cancer cell ablation. This is due to the limited amount of materials assembled on the cancer cells and the weak Joule heating generated in the material.To alleviate these issues, the researchers deposited the M13 virus on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) layered materials to create a hybrid nanomaterial MoS2 Nanostructure with M13 virus (the authors call it MNM). Moreover, they altered the nanomaterial surfaces with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to improve bio-compatibility.The introduction of the M13 virus improves the electro-thermal therapy performance. Compared to conventional 2D materials, a larger amount of MNM assembles on the cancer cells due to the higher specificity of the binding of the M13 virus to cancer cells. Due to the high electrical conductivity of the MoS2 material, a strong Joule heating is also generated.As a result, a larger amount of heat is produced in the nanomaterials, and can be used to kill a larger population of the cancer cells. For example, the MNM nanosystem can decrease the percentage of cancer cells by 23%, which is approximately 2 times higher than what current thermal-based therapy nano-systems can do.\"For many years, cancer eradication has been the dream of cancer patients and researchers. Eliminating recurrence and metastasis of the cancer in the body is of vital importance,\" says principal investigator, Assistant Professor Desmond Loke from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).\"However, a single conventional therapy is unable to eradicate cancer cells completely, due to the diversity, heterogeneity, and complexity of the cancer cells. This is why we aimed to design a simple nanosystem or nanomaterial to synergistically eradicate and treat cancer cells.\"The paper is published in the journal Pharmaceutics. More information:Maria P.

  "text": "In two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnets, anisotropy is essential for the magnetic ordering as dictated by the Mermin-Wagner theorem. The recently discovered van der Waals ferromagnets are largely considered to have uniaxial anisotropy. On the other hand, honeycomb lattice is immune to magnetic frustration even with antiferromagnetic exchange coupling due to its bi-partite unit cell.          However, often ignored interlayer coupling may significantly alter the critical behavior and even the ground state. It is especially so when the interlayer exchange anisotropy has similar magnitude and opposite sign from the intralayer anisotropy. When such competing anisotropies are present, the phase transition becomes nontrivial. Probing the phase transition in 2D ferromagnets under competing anisotropies requires highly sensitive and direct magnetic microscopies and is so far lacking.Shiyuan Wang and colleagues from Fudan University and collaborators from Renmin University employed the high flux sensitivity of scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy (sSQUID) on investigating the critical behavior of a ferromagnetic honeycomb lattice from the bulk to 2D limit. They probed the spin correlations of ABC-stacked CrBr3 under zero magnetic field. In the thick samples, they observed a spike and a plateau region as a function of temperature in susceptibility, which was due to the competition between intra- and inter-layer anisotropies.The spike and the plateau regions broadened and merged with reducing thickness. This reached the limit in the bilayer, where the fluctuation regime is as wide as the transition temperature. This behavior was distinct from both the monolayer and the bulk. The evolution of the critical behavior from the bulk to 2D showed that the competition between the anisotropies was magnified in the reduced dimension.Their observation suggests a frustrated ferromagnetic phase transition in AB-stacked bilayer CrBr3. It demonstrates susceptometry based on sSQUID holds the potential for studying spin frustration in 2D materials.The study is published in the journal Science Bulletin.

  "text": "Northwestern University chemists have designed a new photonic lattice with properties never before seen in nature. In solid materials, atoms must be equally spaced apart and close enough together to interact effectively. Now, new architectures based on stacked lattices of nanoparticles show interactions across unprecedentedly large distances.          When one lattice is stacked on top of the other, the nanoparticles can still interact with each other\u2014even when the vertical separation among particles is 1,000 times the distance of the particle-to-particle spacing within the horizontal plane.Because the nanoparticles can communicate across ultralong distances, the stacked architecture offers potential applications in remote sensing and detection.The study was published this week (Feb. 13) in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.\"This type of long-range coupling has not been observed before for any stacked periodic material,\" said Teri Odom, a senior author of the study. \"Other electronic or photonic stacked layers are separated vertically by a spacing similar to the horizontal periodicity of the building unit in the single layer. This is an entirely new class of engineered materials that have no counterpart or analogue in nature.\"A nanotechnology expert, Odom is chair of Northwestern's chemistry department and the Joan Hustling Madden and William H. Madden Jr. Professor of Chemistry in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. She also is a member of the International Institute of Nanotechnology and the Chemistry of Life Processes Institute. Northwestern co-authors include George Schatz, the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Chemistry at Weinberg.To design the new material, Odom and her team took inspiration from moir\u00e9 patterns, a geometrical design created by two patterns of identical periodic lattices.The researchers first patterned photonic lattices consisting of two-dimensional arrays of nanoparticles with separations that promoted horizontal coupling, resulting in single-layer optical materials. Then, they stacked identical nanoparticle lattices on top of each other to create two-layered and multilayered lattices with new optical properties not accessible from one layer alone.\"We demonstrated that these stacked nanoparticle lattices can interact over ultralong distances by placing organic dye molecules around only one of the nanoparticle lattices in the stacked structure,\" Odom said. \"Then we optically excited the dye.\"The researchers discovered that by rotating one lattice relative to the other, they could change how the patterns interact with light. Depending on the twist angle, the stacked material could function as a nanolaser with emission at different angles. This insight opens new approaches to engineering nano-lasing characteristics. The direction and patterns of the moir\u00e9 laser emission can be controlled in real time.\"This could be used to create new types of biomedical sensors,\" said Jun Guan, the paper's first author and a postdoctoral fellow in Odom's laboratory. \"These devices can be designed to respond to changes in the body, providing important information about a patient's health. A tiny change in the chemicals in the blood environment can cause changes in the way light bends around the photonic lattices. This variation will be magnified by the moir\u00e9 pattern and read out by the corresponding laser emission angles.\" More information:Jun Guan et al, Far-field coupling between moir\u00e9 photonic lattices, Nature Nanotechnology (2023).

  "text": "Since the 1970s, scientists have known that copper has a special ability to transform carbon dioxide into valuable chemicals and fuels. But for many years, scientists have struggled to understand how this common metal works as an electrocatalyst, a mechanism that uses energy from electrons to chemically transform molecules into different products.          Now, a research team led by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) has gained new insight by capturing real-time movies of copper nanoparticles (copper particles engineered at the scale of a billionth of a meter) as they convert CO2 and water into renewable fuels and chemicals: ethylene, ethanol, and propanol, among others. The work was reported in the journal Nature last week.\"This is very exciting. After decades of work, we're finally able to show\u2014with undeniable proof\u2014how copper electrocatalysts excel in CO2 reduction,\" said Peidong Yang, a senior faculty scientist in Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences and Chemical Sciences Divisions who led the study. Yang is also a professor of chemistry and materials science and engineering at UC Berkeley.\"Knowing how copper is such an excellent electrocatalyst brings us steps closer to turning CO2 into new, renewable solar fuels through artificial photosynthesis.\"The work was made possible by combining a new imaging technique called operando 4D electrochemical liquid-cell STEM (scanning transmission electron microscopy) with a soft X-ray probe to investigate the same sample environment: copper nanoparticles in liquid. First author Yao Yang, a UC Berkeley Miller postdoctoral fellow, conceived the groundbreaking approach under the guidance of Peidong Yang while working toward his Ph.D. in chemistry at Cornell University.Scientists who study artificial photosynthesis materials and reactions have wanted to combine the power of an electron probe with X-rays, but the two techniques typically can't be performed by the same instrument.Electron microscopes (such as STEM or TEM) use beams of electrons and excel at characterizing the atomic structure in parts of a material. In recent years, 4D STEM (or \"2D raster of 2D diffraction patterns using scanning transmission electron microscopy\") instruments, such as those at Berkeley Lab's Molecular Foundry, have pushed the boundaries of electron microscopy even further, enabling scientists to map out atomic or molecular regions in a variety of materials, from hard metallic glass to soft, flexible films.On the other hand, soft (or lower-energy) X-rays are useful for identifying and tracking chemical reactions in real time in an operando, or real-world, environment.But now, scientists can have the best of both worlds. At the heart of the new technique is an electrochemical \"liquid cell\" sample holder with remarkable versatility. A thousand times thinner than a human hair, the device is compatible with both STEM and X-ray instruments.The electrochemical liquid cell's ultrathin design allows reliable imaging of delicate samples while protecting them from electron beam damage. A special electrode custom-designed by co-author Cheng Wang, a staff scientist at Berkeley Lab's Advanced Light Source, enabled the team to conduct X-ray experiments with the electrochemical liquid cell. Combining the two allows researchers to comprehensively characterize electrochemical reactions in real time and at the nanoscale.Video of a 4D-STEM experiment during which Yao Yang and team used the new electrochemical liquid cell to observe copper nanoparticles (ranging in size from 7 nanometers to 18 nanometers) evolve into active nanograins during CO2 electrolysis \u2013 a process that uses electricity to drive a reaction on the surface of an electrocatalyst. The new electrochemical liquid cell allows researchers to resolve images of objects smaller than 10 nanometers. Credit: Yao Yang/Berkeley Lab.Getting granularDuring 4D-STEM experiments, Yao Yang and team used the new electrochemical liquid cell to observe copper nanoparticles (ranging in size from 7 nanometers to 18 nanometers) evolve into active nanograins during CO2 electrolysis\u2014a process that uses electricity to drive a reaction on the surface of an electrocatalyst.The experiments revealed a surprise: copper nanoparticles combined into larger metallic copper \"nanograins\" within seconds of the electrochemical reaction.To learn more, the team turned to Wang, who pioneered a technique known as \"resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) for soft materials,\" at the Advanced Light Source more than 10 years ago.With help from Wang, the research team used the same electrochemical liquid cell, but this time during RSoXS experiments, to determine whether copper nanograins facilitate CO2 reduction. Soft X-rays are ideal for studying how copper electrocatalysts evolve during CO2 reduction, Wang explained. By using RSoXS, researchers can monitor multiple reactions between thousands of nanoparticles in real time, and accurately identify chemical reactants and products.The RSoXS experiments at the Advanced Light Source\u2014along with additional evidence gathered at Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS)\u2014proved that metallic copper nanograins serve as active sites for CO2 reduction. (Metallic copper, also known as copper(0), is a form of the element copper.)During CO2 electrolysis, the copper nanoparticles change their structure during a process called \"electrochemical scrambling.\" The copper nanoparticles' surface layer of oxide degrades, creating open sites on the copper surface for CO2 molecules to attach, explained Peidong Yang. And as CO2 \"docks\" or binds to the copper nanograin surface, electrons are then transferred to CO2, causing a reaction that simultaneously produces ethylene, ethanol, and propanol along with other multicarbon products.\"The copper nanograins essentially turn into little chemical manufacturing factories,\" Yao Yang said.Further experiments at the Molecular Foundry, the Advanced Light Source, and CHESS revealed that size matters. All of the 7-nanometer copper nanoparticles participated in CO2 reduction, whereas the larger nanoparticles did not. In addition, the team learned that only metallic copper can efficiently reduce CO2 into multicarbon products. The findings have implications for \"rationally designing efficient CO2 electrocatalysts,\" Peidong Yang said.The new study also validated Peidong Yang's findings from 2017: That the 7-nanometer-sized copper nanoparticles require low inputs of energy to start CO2 reduction. As an electrocatalyst, the 7-nanometer copper nanoparticles required a record-low driving force that is about 300 millivolts less than typical bulk copper electrocatalysts. The best-performing catalysts that produce multicarbon products from CO2 typically operate at high driving force of 1 volt.The copper nanograins could potentially boost the energy efficiency and productivity of some catalysts designed for artificial photosynthesis, a field of research that aims to produce solar fuels from sunlight, water, and CO2. Currently, researchers within the Department of Energy-funded Liquid Sunlight Alliance (LiSA) plan to use the copper nanograin catalysts in the design of future solar fuel devices.\"The technique's ability to record real-time movies of a chemical process opens up exciting opportunities to study many other electrochemical energy conversion processes. It's a huge breakthrough, and it would not have been possible without Yao and his pioneering work,\" Peidong Yang said.

  "text": "Electrocatalysis is an interface-dominated process, in which the activity of the catalyst highly relates to the adsorption/desorption behaviors of the reactants/intermediates/products on the active sites. From the perspective of catalyst design, the chemical functionalization on noble metal surfaces will inevitably affect the reaction process, which is considered to be one of the effective strategies to tune the electrocatalytic performance of noble metal nanocrystals.          Recently, a research team led by Prof. Yu Chen from Shaanxi Normal University, China published a paper in the field of noble metal electrocatalysis. Their paper summarizes the synthesis methods of polyamine (PAM) functionalized noble metal nano-electrocatalysts and their applications in electrocatalytic reactions, and presents the research progress, current deficiencies, challenges and future prospects of chemically functionalized noble metal electrocatalysts, which were published in Chinese Journal of Catalysis.The formation mechanism of PAM molecule functionalized noble metal nanocrystals first is discussed. The authors explain that PAM has a large number of amino groups (\u2212NH2) and/or imino groups (\u2212NH\u2212), in which the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom has a strong coordination ability. In the hydrothermal reaction, PAM can well interact with PtII, RhIII, PdII and AgI to form complexes, which transforms the growth process of noble metal nanocrystals from thermodynamic control to kinetics control.Under kinetic control, the final shape of noble metal nanocrystals no longer tends to form nanospheres with minimal surface free energy, and various anisotropic nanostructures will be obtained based on the reaction conditions, such as nanocubes, nanowires, nanosheets and nanonetworks.The PAM functionalized electrocatalysts are applied in some important electrochemical reactions such as hydrogen precipitation reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which generally reveal enhanced electroactivity. Typically, a large amount of \u2212NH2 and \u2212NH\u2212 in PAM will be protonated to form \u2212NH3+ and \u2212NH2+ in acidic or neutral media, which will directly lead to the increase of the surface proton concentration of PAM-functionalized noble metal nanocrystals.For the proton-coupled electrocatalytic reactions, such as HER and ORR, PAM-functionalized noble metal nanocrystals exhibit lower reaction overpotentials and higher catalytic efficiency due to the interfacial proton enrichment. In addition, the effects of PAM functionalization (such as electronic effect, steric hindrance effect, group effect) on catalyst activity and selectivity are highlighted.Finally, shortcomings, challenges and perspectives in this promising emerging research field are briefly summarized. This work aims to stimulate deeper attention to surfaces/interfaces functionalization and catalysis, increase investment in surfaces/interfaces functionalization research, and change our future renewable energy production and environmental technologies related to electrocatalysis.

  "text": "New research on reproductive health demonstrates the first successful delivery of mRNA to placental cells to treat preeclampsia at its root.          Preeclampsia is a leading cause of stillbirths and prematurity worldwide, occurring in 3-8 % of pregnancies. A disorder characterized by high maternal blood pressure, it results from insufficient vasodilation in the placenta, restricting blood flow from the mother to the fetus.Currently, a health care plan for someone with preeclampsia involves diet and movement changes, frequent monitoring, blood pressure management, and sometimes early delivery of the baby. These standards of care address symptoms of the condition, not the root cause, and further perpetuate health inequity.Now, University of Pennsylvania engineers are addressing this longstanding gap in reproductive health care with targeted RNA therapy.The COVID vaccines demonstrated how lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) efficiently deliver mRNA to target cells. The success of LNPs is opening doors for a variety of RNA therapies aiming to treat the root causes of illness and disease. However, drug development and health care have consistently neglected a portion of the population in need of targeted care the most\u2014pregnant people and their babies.In one of the first studies of its kind, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, Michael Mitchell, J. Peter and Geri Skirkanich Assistant Professor of Innovation in Bioengineering, and Kelsey Swingle, Ph.D. student in the Mitchell Lab and lead author, describe their development of an LNP with the ability to target and deliver mRNA to trophoblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells in the placenta.Once these cells receive the mRNA, they create vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein that helps expand the blood vessels in the placenta to reduce the mother's blood pressure and restore adequate circulation to the fetus. The researchers' successful trials in mice may lead to promising treatments for preeclampsia in humans.      \"Current health care for women with preeclampsia is lacking,\" says Swingle. \"Many times, the only thing doctors have been able to do is plan for an early delivery, resulting in premature births which come with associated challenges. This approach is only worsening the health of mothers and their babies in places where premature care is limited.\"                Credit: Journal of the American Chemical Society (2023). DOI: 10.1021/jacs.2c12893             Swingle pioneered this study on LNP-assisted RNA therapies for pregnant women and their babies. This is the first time LNP-assisted delivery of mRNA to the placenta has been shown.\"With no previous research to start from, our first challenge was to figure out which LNPs would actually travel to and target the placenta,\" says Swingle. \"We started by creating a library of LNPs using our knowledge from the work we did on LNP delivery to the liver. It turns out the liver and the placenta are actually very similar. They both receive high blood flow and contain intricate trees of blood vessels.\"By pairing a pregnant person's natural blood flow to the womb with a highly specific ionizable lipid in the LNP, the research team was able to target and deliver VEGF to placental cells in pregnant mice via a simple tail vein injection.\"The COVID vaccines were administered as intramuscular injections, a shot in the arm,\" says Swingle. \"This treatment would be administered intravenously. That means a pregnant woman would be able to be treated via a simple, non-invasive, and pain-free IV drip.\"Pregnant women were neglected in the clinical trials for the COVID vaccines, leaving many uncertain about how to safeguard their health and that of their babies. This oversight is not new. The majority of drugs on the market have not been tested in pregnant women and disorders during pregnancy are many times untreatable before birth.The treatment presented in the groundbreaking study contributes to the health equity of women, a major motivator for Swingle.\"I was inspired to research targeted therapies for maternal and fetal health in the spring of 2021 when people were making decisions about getting the COVID vaccine and pregnant women had questions about safety that we could not answer,\" she says. \"In the case of preeclampsia, many babies are born early, resulting in stunted or abnormal growth and physiological development. A treatment that resolves the issue at the source would allow for higher quality of life and health for both the child and mother over the long term. Addressing this research gap is one way I can be an advocate for women's health equity.\"The new approach to LNP development for RNA therapies is opening new doors for hard-to-treat diseases. The current study is just one example of where this work is headed.\"Researchers have been doing a lot of work on the mechanisms and movements of drugs into cells, but there is not a lot out there on how therapies can be targeted to treat the root cause of diseases and conditions, particularly during pregnancy,\" says Mitchell. \"We now have a new LNP platform and can plug and play different RNA therapeutics to develop successful therapies for many pregnancy conditions. This work is leaping off that platform and we are excited to take the next steps.\" More information:Kelsey L.

The group narrowed their research to specific metal oxide nanoparticles and ensured testing dosages appropriate for humans.\"Between our two universities, our research used a nice set of systems that complement each other,\" said Gretchen Mahler, professor of biomedical engineering at Binghamton and interim vice provost and dean of the graduate school.\"We used our in vitro gut models of the small intestine to conduct assays and screen nanoparticle dosages,\" Mahler said. \"We then can validate what we observed in vitro by using Elad Tako's animal model.\"The scientists are not advocating for ending the use of these nanoparticles.\"Based on the information, we suggest simply being aware,\" Tako said. \"Science needs to conduct further investigations based on our findings. We are opening the door for discussion.\"In addition to Tako and Mahler, co-authors included Cornell doctoral candidates Jacquelyn Cheng (first author) and Nikolai Kolba; Binghamton postdoctoral fellow Alba Garci\u0301a-Rodri\u0301guez; and Cl\u00e1udia Marques, associate professor of biological sciences at Binghamton.The research is part of the journal's special issue on dietary supplements and oxidative stress.

  "text": "Advances in computing power over the decades have come thanks in part to our ability to make smaller and smaller transistors, a building block of electronic devices, but we are nearing the limit of the silicon materials typically used. A new technique for creating 2D oxide materials may pave the way for future high-speed electronics, according to an international team of scientists.          \"One way we can make our transistors, our electronic devices, work faster is to shrink the distance electrons have to travel between point A and B,\" said Joshua Robinson, professor of materials science and engineering at Penn State. \"You can only go so far with 3D materials like silicon\u2014once you shrink it down to a nanometer, its properties change. So there's been a massive push looking at new materials, one of which are 2D materials.\"The team, led by Furkan Turker, graduate student in the Department of Materials Sciences, used a technique called confinement hetroepitaxy, or CHet, to create 2D oxides, materials with special properties that can serve as an atomically thin insulating layer between layers of electrically conducting materials.\"Now we can create essentially the world's thinnest oxides\u2014just a few atoms thick,\" Turker said. \"That allows you to bring conducting layers closer together than ever without letting them touch. This enables the formation of an ultrathin barrier between conducting layers, which is essential for the fabrication of next-generation electronic devices, such as diodes or transistors.\"In laboratory tests, the oxides showed good properties for use in 2D/3D stacked materials called heterostructures that can enable electrons to travel vertically through the structure instead of horizontally like conventional devices.This shortens the distance the electrons must travel to create a flow of electricity, important for building future high-speed devices that operate at gigahertz and terahertz frequencies, the scientists said. They reported their findings in the journal Advanced Functional Materials.\"That's the real motivation behind this\u2014can we create something that's an insulator that is essentially only a few atoms thick and still be able to control the electronic properties of the entire stack,\" Robinson said. \"And because it's much shorter that means our electrons can go from A to B faster and they don't have to increase their speed at all.\"      The research draws on previous work at Penn State using confinement heteroepitaxy to create atomic thin metals, which is now being explored as part of the Center for Nanoscale Science at Penn State, a National Science Foundation Materials Research, Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC).The process involves heating silicon carbide to a high temperature, causing a thin layer of silicon to evaporate from the surface and leaving behind carbon that rearranges to form graphene\u2014a 2D version of carbon, essentially forming a protective layer over the material.Importantly, the graphene and silicon carbide interface is only partially stable. This means when the scientists poke holes in the graphene and evaporate pure metal powders onto the surface at high temperatures, the metals are pulled into the holes in a capillary action-like process, the scientists said.Those metals are conducting, or even superconducting, but can be made into insulators via oxidation\u2014the same process that causes metals to rust when exposed to air.In the new work, the scientists created additional holes or patterns in the material and heated it again, allowing gas to interact with the metal layer inside.\"It really is like Legoland\u2014you can get all sorts of 'Lego' colors and stack them on top of each other, and the same is with these 2D materials,\" Robinson said. \"In this work, we create our stack of 'Legos' and then change the color of the 'Lego' in the middle by slowly squeezing in a little oxygen, without removing anything else.\"The process allows scientists to stabilize traditionally 3D materials like gallium oxide in 2D form.When growing gallium oxide by traditional methods, the material initially will ball or clump together and does not result in a uniform film until the material is several nanometers thick, the scientists said.The CHet technique produces a graphene cap that sandwiches the materials in and results in molecularly thin layers, the scientists said.\"The properties of the graphene control everything underneath it,\" Turker said. \"The number one thing this paper demonstrates is that the graphene is a gatekeeper and by being able to control the properties of our gatekeeper, we can tune layers underneath it to form a 2D metal, or oxide, by which we can manipulate the electronic properties of the 2D/3D heterostructure.\"Further work will involve growing materials on top the graphene to create the device structure and studying the junctions between those layers and potential defects in the materials.

  "text": "CO2 hydrogenation with green hydrogen is one of the best processes to combat climate change and can provide a single solution to three challenging problems, 1) excessive CO2 levels, 2) the temporal mismatch between solar electricity production and demand, and 3) hydrogen gas storage. However, the CO2 hydrogenation reaction needs very high temperatures, causing quick deactivation of the catalyst.          In new work published in ACS Nano, researchers at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai, asked the question of whether this high-temperature CO2 hydrogenation can be catalyzed at room to moderate temperature via plasmonic excitation of H2 and CO2 using plasmonic catalyst. They have demonstrated that plasmonic black gold-nickel efficiently catalyzes CO2 hydrogenation using visible light.The reaction took place as low as 84 to 223\u00b0C without external heating. Researchers found a multifold increase in the catalytic activity as compared to DPC-C4 to the extent that measurable photoactivity was only observed with DPC-C4-Ni. It showed the best-reported CO production rate of 2464\u00b1 40 mmol gNi-1 h-1 and selectivity greater than 95% in the flow conditions. The catalyst showed extraordinary stability (100 h).Super-linear power law dependence on the light intensity (power law exponent of 5.6) with photocatalytic quantum efficiencies increased with an rise in light intensity and reaction temperature, while the kinetic isotope effect (KIE) in light (1.91) was higher than in the dark, confirmed the hot-electron mediated reaction mechanism. Ultrafast studies of hot-carrier dynamics proved the superfast electron injection from Au to Ni, populating the Ni reactor with charge carriers. Researchers observed a spectral signature of such an indirect charge generation due to hot electron transfer from the gold to the nickel. Finite-difference time-domain simulations also showed plasmon-induced high local field intensity enhancement in DPC-C4-Ni.An in-situ DRIFTS study showed C=O stretching vibrations of linearly bonded CO atop Ni atom, while bridge carbonyl species formation was hindered. CO2 hydrogenation took place by direct dissociation path via linearly bonded nickel-CO. The linearly bonded CO on Ni sites of DPC-C4-Ni were weakly bonded due to its weak Ni-C bond. Hence CO desorption was efficient, restricting hydrogenation to methane, leading to more than 95% CO selectivity.The high production rate and selectivity were due to Ni NPs being highly dispersed on black gold, providing a weakly bonded CO pathway, in addition to the excellent light-harvesting ability of black gold. Due to the excitation of electrons in the nickel d-band to higher energy level during plasmonic damping of black gold SPR, as well as to filling of Ni d-band due to hot electron transfer from black gold to Ni, Ni sites showed excellent activity even at smaller particle size.The outstanding catalytic performance of black gold-Ni may provide a way to develop plasmonic catalysts for CO2 reduction and other catalytic processes using black gold.

  "text": "Professor Juhyuk Lee of the Department of Energy Engineering has developed an elastic triboelectric generator that can be used in the daily lives of frequent movers. The cause of the output reduction of the elastic triboelectric sensor was identified during joint research with Professor Joohun Lee of Hanyang University's (ERICA campus) Department of Bio-Nanotechnology. Additionally, the professor used graphene to develop a touch sensor with stable output and expand the application of the triboelectric generator. The study is published in the journal Nano Energy.          Along with the rapid growth of various biosensors and wearable devices due to the continuous development of semiconductors and small electronic components, there has been a growing interest in triboelectric generators for use as sensors or energy sources. To use the triboelectric generator in a wearable device, the material that comes into contact with the body must be safe, and the output must be constant despite any deformations caused by movement.However, the output of conventional elastic triboelectric generators is affected by its change in form. The reason for this relationship was not clearly understood. Similar to previously existing products, there are limitations to precise detection if the output changes along with the change in form, such as stretching.Therefore, the research team developed a triboelectric generator using graphene electrodes and PVC gel to fabricate a stable sensor with constant output despite physical movement. In particular, the correlation between the transformation rate of the elastic graphene-based electrode and electrical resistance was analyzed to allow constant electricity output from touch and pressure even under the maximum stretching of 50%, which is higher than the transformation rate that can occur from physical movement. In addition, the material used in the research passed the biostability assessment, indicating that it can be used in daily lives.Professor Juhyuk Lee of the DGIST Department of Energy Engineering said, \"The drawbacks of the conventional elastic electrode-based triboelectric generator were addressed, and a technology that generates constant output according to touch or movement was developed.

  "text": "A team of FAMU-FSU College of Engineering researchers at the High-Performance Materials Institute is exploring the thermal limits of advanced nanomaterials, work that could have a direct impact on medicine delivery systems, electronics, space travel and other applications.          The research team, led by Assistant Professor in Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering Rebekah Sweat, completed the first-ever study on how purified boron nitride nanotubes remain stable in extreme temperatures in inert environments.Their work was published in the journal Applied Nano Materials.Boron nitride nanotubes, or BNNTs, are stronger and more resistant to high temperatures than carbon nanotubes. Like their carbon cousins, they are structures measured by the nanometer\u2014a length equal to one-billionth of a meter.But manufacturing these materials is challenging. Current methods for BNNTs are newer and do not yet produce the same quantities as methods devised for carbon nanotubes. That's why learning more about how they function is important.The researchers found that BNNTs are fully stable at up to 1800\u00b0C in an inert environment, the chemically inactive atmosphere in which they are manufactured. They also learned that BNNTs can withstand temperatures at 2200\u00b0C for short periods without losing the mechanical properties that make them so effective.\"This research is about uncovering a property that is incredibly useful for the future,\" Sweat said. \"We have a more robust knowledge of how BNNTs perform when and how they thermally fail\u2014because all materials do have limitations. We have changed how we make these types of composites to better utilize their properties.\"Potential applications for these light, strong composite materials are numerous. Anything that gets hot, like a turbine or engine, might use them to function in a high-temperature environment. They are thermally conducting, which means they spread heat out quickly, and their mechanical stability offers structural reinforcement.BNNTs show particular promise for their use in space exploration. Their ability to conduct heat, insulate electrical current and block radiation could be used in space rovers or a spacecraft during reentry to Earth's atmosphere. Those same properties also make them useful for high-performance electronics.\"Understanding the behavior of these nanotubes at high temperatures is crucial for creating materials that can withstand extreme conditions, both in manufacturing and in their final use,\" said lead author and doctoral student Mehul Tank. \"As we understand better how they function in these conditions, we'll be able to develop better manufacturing of composites that employ high-temperature processing matrices, like ceramics and metals.\" More information:Mehul J.

  "text": "As devices get smaller and more powerful, the risk of them overheating and burning out increases substantially. Despite advancements in cooling solutions, the interface between an electronic chip and its cooling system has remained a barrier for thermal transport due to the materials' intrinsic roughness.          Sheng Shen, Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University has fabricated a flexible, powerful, and highly reliable material to efficiently fill the gap.\"At first glance, our solution looks like any ordinary copper film, but under a microscope the novelty of our material becomes clear,\" explained Lin Jing, PhD student.The material, composed of two thin copper films with a graphene-coated copper nanowire array sandwiched between, is extremely user-friendly.\"Other nanowires need to be in-situ grown where the heat is designed to be dissipated so that their application threshold and cost is high,\" said Rui Cheng, postdoctoral researcher in Shen's lab. \"Our film isn't dependent on any substrate, it is a free standing film that can be cut to any size or shape to fill the gap between various electrical components.\"The \"sandwich\" builds out of Shen's \"supersolder,\" a thermal interface material (TIM) that can  be used similarly as conventional solders, but with twice the thermal conductance of current state-of-the-art TIMs.                Cross-section of the material under scanning electron microscope.             By coating the \"supersolder\" in graphene, Shen's team enhanced its thermal transport capabilities and prevented the risk of oxidation, ensuring a longer service life. The \"sandwich,\" compared to the thermal pastes/adhesives currently on the market, can reduce thermal resistance by more than 90% when considering the same thickness.Thanks to its ultra high mechanical flexibility, the \"sandwich\" can enable a wide range of applications in flexible electronics and microelectronics, including flexible LEDs and lasers for lighting and display, wearable sensors for communication, implantable electronics for monitoring health and imaging, and soft robotics.Moving forward, Shen's team will explore ways to scale the material at an industrial level, lower its cost, while continuing to seek ways to improve it.\"We are very excited about this material's potential,\" Shen shared. \"We believe that a wide variety of electronic systems can benefit from it by allowing them to operate at a lower temperature with higher performance.\"The research is published in the journal ACS Nano.

  "text": "A new study led by Dai Qing's team from the National Center for Nanoscience and Technology (NCNST) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Javier Abajo from the Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO) in Spain has shown a gate-tunable nanoscale negative refraction of polaritons in the mid-infrared range through a van der Waals heterostructure of graphene and molybdenum trioxide.          The atomically thick heterostructures weaken scattering losses at the interface while enabling an actively tunable transition of normal to negative refraction through electrical gating.The work was published in Science.The photonic-electronic fusion at the nanoscale is an important development direction for future high-performance information devices. The integration of optoelectronic devices is determined by the optoelectronic interconnection method, which affects its speed and power consumption and is the key to improving device performance.However, photons do not carry charges and the transmission of light is limited by the optical diffraction limit, making it difficult to manipulate and control photons at the nanoscale compared to electrons, which can easily be regulated through electrical means.In 1951, Chinese solid-state physicist Academician Huang Kun predicted the polariton quasi-particle formed by the interaction between photons and matter through his famous \"Huang equation.\" After years of investigation and constant in-depth discovery, polaritons have been proven to be able to easily break through the optical diffraction limit and compress the wavelength of light to the nanoscale, and the field distribution of polaritons is closely related to the dielectric environment.The team from NCNST suggested the use of polaritons as a medium for optoelectronic interconnections to capitalize on their high compression and easy modulation of light. It was anticipated that polaritons would not only enable effective optoelectronic interconnections but also offer new information processing capabilities that would significantly improve the performance of optoelectronic fusion devices.In recent work, Dai's team and their collaborators discovered the \"axial dispersion\" effect of polarized excitons in low-symmetry crystals, solved the long-range transport problem of plasmonics in graphene, and proposed a new mechanism for the regulation of polaritons by heterojunctions.Based on this, the researchers designed and fabricated a nanoscale graphene/molybdenum trioxide van der Waals heterostructure.They explained that the van der Waals heterostructure fully exploits the nanophotonic properties of various materials, where the atomic layer thickness provides the basis for highly compressed optical modes, the lattice structure properties support isotropic (circular) and anisotropic (hyperbolic) transport modes, the van der Waals stacking satisfies the near-field matching of mode hybridization, and the linear energy band structure provides a platform for mode hybridization.In addition, the researchers realized dynamically tunable positive-negative refractive transitions in the deep subdiffraction limit and overcame performance bottlenecks in terms of waveband, loss, compression, and modulation of conventional structural optical solutions such as the use of metamaterials and photonic crystals.\"This dynamically tunable positive and negative refraction conversion phenomenon can be understood as a 'polariton transistor' function that uses one kind of polariton to regulate the switching of another polariton, which allows the construction of optical logic units such as those with and without gates and is anticipated to be applied in many fields, such as photoelectric fusion,\" said Dai, one of the paper's corresponding authors.

  "text": "A research team led by Dr. Ho Sang Jung of the Surface & Nano Materials Division of the Korea Institute of Materials Science (KIMS), a research institute under the Ministry of Science and ICT, conducted joint research with Professor Junsuk Rho of POSTECH and Professor Samjin Choi of Kyung Hee University Medical School to find metabolites in urine and develop a strip-type urine sensor that can amplify the light signal of those metabolites to diagnose cancer.          This technology can be applied to the diagnosis of prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer without an additional analysis process by irradiating light in a small volume (10uL) of urine. The test device is manufactured in the form of a strip so that cancer can be diagnosed quickly and with high sensitivity.The research team focused on the difference in metabolomic components present in the urine of cancer patients versus cancer-free patients. When cancer cells proliferate in the body, they secrete different metabolites into urine due to abnormal metabolism. In order to classify these, expensive and large equipment was required, limiting on-site field application.The research team developed a surface-enhanced Raman scattering sensor that amplifies the optical signal of metabolites in urine more than 1 billion times by forming a coral-shaped plasmonic nanomaterial on porous paper. When urine is dropped into the sensor and light is irradiated, cancer metabolite signals are amplified on the sensor surface, making it possible to diagnose cancer. The research team applied an artificial intelligence-based analysis method to the acquired spectral signal and succeeded in distinguishing up to 99% of prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer in patients.A number of currently used diagnosis techniques detect the presence of cancer through blood tests or radiological methods and histological analysis. Many people try to track the occurrence of cancer through annual health checkups, but in many cases, cancer is detected late and treatment is delayed. This study used urine, a biological sample that can be easily obtained. It can be used for both new cancer diagnosis through on-site rapid cancer patient screening and recurrence monitoring after cancer treatment. In addition, since the production price of the strip-type sensor is less than 100 KRW (approximately $0.08 USD) per unit, it is expected that it can be used for mass inspection.Senior researcher Ho Sang Jung, who is in charge of the research, said, \"In the case of cancers where the diagnosis method is not well known, such as pancreatic cancer, it is difficult to detect and the survival rate after initial diagnosis is low. It is known that 14 pancreatic cancer patients die every day in Korea, and the economic cost per person is about 63 million won per year.\"Since early diagnosis is the most important for incurable diseases such as cancer, we expect this technology to provide a new diagnostic method.\"The research results were published on January 9 in Biosensors and Bioelectronics. The research team has applied for related patents in Korea and the United States.Currently, the team is gradually increasing the types of cancer that can be diagnosed by analyzing the urine of  colorectal cancer and lung cancer patients.

  "text": "Carbon nanotubes are a novel material that is 100 times stronger than steel while only one-fourth its weight and has electrical conductivity as high as that of copper. If fibers could be made using carbon nanotubes, theoretically, these fibers could surpass the performance of existing carbon fibers, making carbon-nanotube-based fibers a novel material of interest in the aerospace, military, and mobility industries. However, maintaining the superior properties of carbon nanotubes in fibers is very challenging, and the commercialization of such fibers is difficult due to the extremely high cost of carbon nanotubes.          A research team led by Dr. Bon-Cheol Ku of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) Jeonbuk Institute of Advanced Composite Materials collaborated with a research team led by Professor Han Gi Chae from the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) to develop a low-cost fabrication technology for carbon-nanotube-based composite carbon fibers with extremely high tensile strength and high modulus. The study is published in the journal Composites Part B: Engineering.Generally, carbon fibers are manufactured as high-strength fibers based on the polymer polyacrylonitrile (PAN) or highly modulus fibers using pitch derived from pyrolyzed fuel oil. The research team developed a technology that greatly improved the modulus while maintaining high strength by utilizing carbon nanotubes and polyimide (PI).The team successfully fabricated fibers with high modulus (528 GPa) and high strength (6.2 GPa) by initially creating a carbon nanotube and polyimide composite fiber using a continuous wet spinning process and then applying a high-temperature heat treatment. The reported modulus is 1.6 times greater than that of commercially available fibers (~320 GPa).Additionally, microstructure analysis verified that the physical properties of the fabricated material were improved by reducing the void within the fibers, and that the carbon nanotube/polyimide compound improved the orientation of the carbon nanotubes. The research team was able to fabricate these extremely high-strength and modulus fibers while replacing up to 50% of the carbon nanotubes with low-cost polyimide to lower the overall cost.Dr. Ku of KIST said, \"This research is meaningful because the fabrication cost of carbon-nanotube-based carbon fibers can be greatly reduced by using low-cost polymers.\" He added, \"These novel carbon fibers, which used to be difficult to commercialize due to high cost, are expected to be used in the aerospace, military, and future mobility industries.\" More information:Seo Gyun Kim et al, Ultrahigh strength and modulus of polyimide-carbon nanotube based carbon and graphitic fibers with superior electrical and thermal conductivities for advanced composite applications, Composites Part B: Engineering (2022).

The nanostructures studied were produced in his group.The technology of our digital world is based on the principle that either a current flows or it does not: one or zero, on or off. Two clear states exist. In quantum physics, on the other hand, it is possible to disregard this principle and create an arbitrary superposition of the supposed opposites. This increases the possibilities of transmitting and processing information many times over. Such superposition states have been known for some time, especially for the particles of light, so-called photons, and are used in the detection of gravitational waves.Quantum states detectedA team of physicists and physical chemists from Bielefeld and W\u00fcrzburg has now succeeded in detecting such superposition states of light directly in a nanostructure. Light is captured in a nanostructure in a very small space and couples to electronic oscillations: so-called plasmons. This allows the energy of the light to be held in place on the nanoscale.In the experiment in the group of W\u00fcrzburg professor Tobias Brixner, the researchers investigated how many photons from a light pulse couple to the nanostructure. The result: simultaneously no photon and three photons. Brixner explains, \"Detecting this signature was an enormous challenge. Photons can be detected very well with sensitive detectors; however, in the case of single photons, which are also in a quantum mechanical superposition state, suitable methods did not exist in the nanoworld.\" In addition, the coupled states of photons and electrons survive for less than a millionth of a millionth of a second and then decay again, leaving hardly any time for their detection.Highest spatial and temporal resolution combinedIn the experiments now published, a special detection was used. \"The energy released during the decay of the state is sufficient to release other electrons from the nanostructure,\" explains Professor Walter Pfeiffer (Bielefeld), who played a key role in developing the physical model and interpreting the data. The triggered electrons could then be captured in an image using a photoemission electron microscope and a resolution of a few nanometers. Because of the fast decay times, sequences of ultrashort laser pulses were used to obtain the \"fingerprint\" of the superposition states of the light.This is a first step toward the goal of analyzing the full quantum physical state of coupled photon and electrons directly at the nanoscale. A process that, as in medicine, is described by the term tomography. The light in the offices and laboratories of the scientists involved should thus clearly remain switched on.

  "text": "A Chinese team has published new work on battery designs employing heterostructured nanoflowers in Energy Material Advances.          \"Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have shown to be promising candidate to replace lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), because Na is considered ubiquitous on Earth,\" said paper author Jun Song Chen, with School of Materials and Energy, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. \"However, the larger atomic size of sodium than lithium results in retarded charge diffusion and severe volume change during sodium storage, thus deteriorating the cycling stability and rate performance of SIBs.\"It is crucial to design unique electrode materials with enhanced electrochemical properties to address these drawbacks. Chen explained that transition metal sulfides are attractive for sodium storage among various anode materials. Besides, constructing heterostructures is also effective to enhance the electrochemical properties of active materials, which induces a strong internal electric field at the interface between two components, offering extra driving force for the ions and electrons transport at the boundary.\"Inspired by these ideas, we constructed a unique NiS2/FeS heterostructure by a multi-step method,\" Chen said. \"The as-synthesized NiS2/FeS exhibited good sodium storage properties with enhanced high-rate performance of 156 mAh g-1 at 50 A g-1, and high stable long cyclic retention of 606 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 after 1000 cycles, much better than other metal sulfide electrodes.\"The mechanism of the enhanced performance due to heterostructure need to be confirmed. According to Chen, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were adopted to uncover the reason for the superior battery performance of the NiS2/FeS heterostructure.\"The NiS2/FeS heterostructure displayed the lowest Na migration energy barrier [compared to] pure NiS2 and FeS, confirming the fastest Na diffusion at the interface. In addition, NiS2/FeS demonstrated the highest adsorption energy, implying that the heterostructure provided the most stable adsorption of Na, thus offered improved structure stability upon repeated charge/discharge. Furthermore, the calculated total DOS (TDOS) showed that the NiS2/FeS heterostructure possessed the maximum charge density near the Fermi level, indicating that the NiS2/FeS possessed enhanced electrical conductivity,\" Chen said.\"As the DFT calculations showed, the NiS2/FeS heterostructure significantly enhanced the electrical conductivity, kinetic diffusion of Na+ and structure stability, leading to high reversible capacities and superior cycling stability, which matched well with the experimental results.\"The researchers also explored the potential for commercial applications of as-synthesized NiS2/FeS. \"We investigated the full-cell performance by assembling devices using Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) as the cathode and NiS2/FeS as the anode,\" Chen said. \"As-assembled NVP||NiS2/FeS full cell exhibited good electrochemical performance, with good commercial potential.\"This work provides an effective approach to design composite functional materials with heterostructures for different applications with improved properties.

  "text": "Scientists at the University of Helsinki offer new insights into the control over reaction selectivity with visible light in plasmonic catalysis.          In their discovery, it was found that by engineering the composition in nanoparticles containing Ag and Pd, visible light irradiation could be employed as a sustainable energy input not only to accelerate molecular transformations but also to enable control over reaction selectivity.For example, by employing the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene as a model transformation, scientist demonstrated that visible-light irradiation can be employed to steer the reaction pathway from hydrogenation to homocoupling, changing the nature of the products that are generated with and without visible light illumination. The results have been published in the journal Angewandte Chemie.\"This is an exciting discovery,\" said professor Pedro Camargo from the University of Helsinki, who led the study. \"The control over reaction selectivity with visible-light through plasmonic catalysis can pave the way for more sustainable and efficient chemical processes.\"The use of visible light to accelerate chemical reactions via plasmonic catalysis offers unique opportunities to achieve much milder reaction conditions relative to reactions conventionally carried out under external heating and high pressure, for example.Reaction selectivity in nanocatalysis remains challengingPlasmonic catalysis involves using the collective oscillations of electrons in metal nanoparticles to enhance chemical reactions. This approach has been widely studied due to its potential for reducing the amount of energy required to drive chemical reactions and increasing reaction rates.Catalysis plays a central role in our society. It refers to the acceleration of molecular transformations in the presence of a catalyst, which enabled faster chemical reactions but is not consumed in the reaction itself. The use of nanoparticles as catalysts (aka, nanocatalysis) impacts the production of a wide range of products, from fuels to chemicals and pharmaceuticals. In this context, more efficient catalytic process can not only lower environmental impacts but also increase access to essential products for people all over the world.Controlling reaction selectivity in nanocatalysis is crucial because, in many cases, a reaction can produce multiple products. Some of these may be unwanted or have less value. If we could control reaction selectivity, we could enable the formation of a desired product, making processes more efficient and cost-effective process while avoiding extra steps of purification and decreasing the generation of waste. Thus, control over selectivity saves time, resources, and energy.Despite its very attractive features, the control over reaction selectivity in nanocatalysis remains challenging.

  "text": "In a new approach to security that unites technology and art, EPFL researchers have combined silver nanostructures with polarized light to yield a range of brilliant colors, which can be used to encode messages.          Cryptography is something of a new field for Olivier Martin, who has been studying the optics of nanostructures for many years as head of the Nanophotonics and Metrology Lab EPFL's School of Engineering. But after developing some new silver nanostructures in collaboration with the Center of MicroNanoTechnology, Martin and Ph.D. student Hsiang-Chu Wang noticed that these nanostructures reacted to polarized light in an unexpected way, which just happened to be perfect for encoding information.They found that when polarized light was shone through the nanostructures from certain directions, a range of vivid and easily-identifiable colors was reflected back. These different colors could be assigned numbers, which could then be used to represent letters using the electronic communication standard code ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). To encode a secret message, the researchers applied a quaternary code using the digits 0, 1, 2 and 3 (as opposed to the more commonly used binary code 0 and 1). The result was a series of four-digit strings composed of different color combinations that could be used to spell out a message, and the method of chromo-encryption was born.For example, using their system, the color sequence orange, yellow, red, white represented the digits 1, 0, 2, 0, respectively; a string of numbers which in turn coded for the letter \"H' in the secret test message \"Hello!\"\"Each color code is not unique, meaning that the same digit\u20140, 1, 2 or 3\u2014may represent a different color. This means the encryption system is even more secure, because the chance of guessing the correct code sequence is smaller,\" Martin explains. The lab's results have recently been published in the journal Advanced Optical Materials.                The top row represents the message \"Hello!\" in quaternary code, which is revealed when the silver nanostructures are illuminated with the correct polarization. The bottom two rows display incorrect sequences when incorrect polarization keys are used. Credit: NAM EPFL             A surprising response to lightAt the heart of the new method lies the silver nanostructures' unique reaction to polarized light. The different hues that the researchers observed were first produced by varying the length and position of the nanostructures. Next, the researchers shone polarized light onto them, meaning that the light waves oscillated in controlled directions (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally). Depending on the polarization direction, the light reflected from the nanostructures changed from dull to vivid, yielding robust colors that were then sent through a second polarizer for analysis.Crucially, in the chromo-encryption method, only the correct combination of polarization directions would reveal the secret message; light polarized in any other direction would reveal a series of colors corresponding to a nonsense message.Martin explains that to their surprise, the nanostructures exhibited what is known as a chiral response, as they reflected the polarized light in a different direction than the excitation itself. In physics and chemistry, chirality\u2014or the properties of a material that arise from its geometric asymmetry\u2014is an important and well-studied functional aspect of molecules like proteins. But it was not expected to be seen in the symmetrical silver nanostructures.\"Chirality is a concept that is often misused, and is difficult to nail down. The fundamental aspect of chirality in simple geometries like those exhibited by our nanostructures is a key finding of this study.\"                Schematic illustrating the effect of different polarization directions on the colors reflected by the silver nanostructures. Credit: NAM EPFL             Combining technology with the human eyeIn addition to encoding messages, the researchers demonstrated that they could use their method to reproduce a painting\u2014in this case, Picasso's Mediterranean Landscape\u2014at the nanometer scale. To achieve this, they replaced the pixels of a digital reproduction of the painting with their silver nanostructures. Just as with the chromo-encryption method, the artwork was only revealed when light polarized in the correct direction was shone onto the \"nano-painting.\"Martin says he believes that the method's combination of nanotechnology with human visual perception has a lot of potential both for artistic applications and encryption techniques, such as more secure banknotes.\"Nanomaterials and color are at the crossroads of high-tech and artistry, and I find that very appealing. Using nanostructures, you can encode a huge amount of information onto an extremely small area, so there is the potential for very high information density. At the same time, an approach to encryption that can be read and interpreted by the naked human eye, as opposed to a computer, could be advantageous.\" More information:Hsiang\u2010Chu Wang et al, Polarization\u2010Controlled Chromo\u2010Encryption, Advanced Optical Materials (2023).

  "text": "Fiber sensing scientists at Shenzhen University have developed a compact fiber optical nanomechanical probe (FONP) for measuring in vivo biomechanical properties of tissue and even single cells.          Publishing in the journal International Journal of Extreme Manufacturing, the researchers from Shenzhen University applied femtosecond laser-induced two\u2010photon polymerization technology to fabricate a fiber-tip microprobe with ultrahigh mechanical precision down to 2.1 nanonewton.This high-precision mechanical sensing system enables the measurement of in vivo biomechanical properties of tissue, single cell, and other types of soft biomaterials. The findings could have a widespread impact on the future development of all-fiber Atomic Force Microscopy for biomechanical testing and nanomanipulation.One of the lead researchers, Professor Yiping Wang, commented, \"The biomechanical properties of different tissues in the human body range widely with seven orders of magnitude, from the softest cells to the stiffest bones. We have developed a flexible strategy that could design and fabricate the fiber-tip microprobes with the most fitted spring constant for the accurate in vivo biomechanical measurement of almost all the tissues in the human body.\"Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is one of the few technologies that could perform delicate biomechanical measurements. However, there are typical limitations of bench-top AFM system in its size and complex feedback system. It also requires certain geometry of the samples to be measured, which further limits its application in biomechanical measurement in vivo.First author Dr. Mengqiang Zou claimed, \"Our work achieved a new generation of all-fiber AFM with the flexible methodology to achieve the best design of the fiber-tip microprobe for every in vivo test, which was turned out to be reliable and also much more miniaturized.\"Professor Changrui Liao has pioneered fiber-tip microdevices fabricated by femtosecond laser-induced two-photon polymerization technology for gas sensing. Here his group has developed the technology to achieve various fiber-tip microstructures, specifically in terms of microcantilevers with additional topological design, to achieve microprobes with a series of spring constants.This development allows the \"all-fiber AFM\" to become a next-generation tool for basic research involving the in vivo biomechanical measurement of various types of tissues.The team utilized the finite element method and topological theory to optimize the design of fiber-tip microcantilever probes. The finest microprobe could reach a reliable measuring capability down to 2.1 nanonewton.Professor Sandor Kasas said, \"This is a milestone achievement and it is only the beginning.

  "text": "Writing in the Journal of Molecular Liquids, a team led by Professor Aravind Vijayaraghavan based in the National Graphene Institute (NGI) have produced three-dimensional particles made of graphene, of many interesting shapes, using a variation of the vortex ring effect. The same effect is used to produce smoke rings and is responsible for keeping dandelion seeds flying. These particles have also been shown to be exceptionally efficient in adsorbing contaminants from water, thereby purifying it.          The researchers have shown that the formation of these graphene particles is governed by a complex interplay between different forces such as viscosity, surface tension, inertia and electrostatics. Prof Vijayaraghavan said, \"We have undertaken a systematic study to understand and explain the influence of various parameters and forces involved in the particle formation. Then, by tailoring this process, we have developed very efficient particles for adsorptive purification of contaminants from water.\"Graphene oxide (GO), a functionalized form of graphene that forms a stable dispersion in water, has many unique properties, including being a liquid crystal. Individual GO sheets are one atom thin, and as wide as the thickness of human hair. However, to be useful, they need to be assembled into complex 3-dimensional shapes that preserves their high surface area and surface chemistry. Such porous 3-dimensional assemblies of GO are called aerogels, and when filled with water, they are called hydrogels.The researchers used a second liquid crystal material called CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide), to aggregate GO flakes into small particles of graphene oxide hydrogels, without needing to reduce them to graphene. This was achieved by dropping the GO dispersion in water in the form of small droplets into a solution of CTAB in water.When the GO droplets hit the surface of the CTAB solution, they behave very similarly to when a jet of hot smoke hits cold air. The GO drop flows into the CTAB solution in the form of a ring, or toroid, because of differences in the density and surface tension of the two liquids.Credit: Journal of Molecular Liquids (2023). DOI: 10.1016/j.molliq.2023.121341By controlling various parameters of this process, the researchers have produced particles in the shape of spheres (balls), toroids (donuts) and intermediate shapes that resemble jellyfish. Dr. Yizhen Shao, a recently graduated Ph.D. student and lead author of this paper, said, \"We have developed a universal phase diagram for the formation of these shapes, based on four dimensionless numbers\u2014the weber, Reynolds, Onhesorge and Weber numbers, representing the inertial, viscous, surface tension and electrostatic forces respectively. This can be used to accurately control the particle morphology by varying the formation parameters.\" The researchers used high-speed photography to capture the formation and evolution of these particle shapes\u2014seen here.The authors highlight the significance of these particles in water purification. Kaiwen Nie, a Ph.D. student and co-author of the paper, said, \"We can tune the surface chemistry of the graphene flakes in these particles to extract positively or negatively charged contaminants from water.

  "text": "Scientists have developed a world-first diagnostic test, powered by artificial intelligence, that can identify known respiratory viruses within five minutes from just one nasal or throat swab. The new diagnostic test could replace current methods that are limited to testing for only one infection\u2014such as a lateral flow test for COVID-19\u2014or otherwise are either lab-based and time-consuming or fast and less accurate.          The new virus detection and identification methodology is described in a paper published in ACS Nano, authored by Department of Physics DPhil student Nicolas Shiaelis along with corresponding authors Professor Achillefs Kapanidis from the Department of Physics and Dr. Nicole Robb from the University of Warwick and Visiting Lecturer at Oxford's Department of Physics.The paper demonstrates how machine learning can significantly improve the efficiency, accuracy and time taken to not only identify different types of viruses, but also differentiate between strains.Ground-breaking testing technologyNicolas Shiaelis and Dr. Robb collaborated with the John Radcliffe Hospital to validate the new method that uses AI software to identify viruses. The ground-breaking testing technology combines molecular labeling, computer vision and machine learning to create a universal diagnostic imaging platform that looks directly at a patient sample and can identify which pathogen is present in a matter of seconds\u2014much like facial recognition software, but for germs.Preliminary research demonstrated that this test could identify the COVID-19 virus in patient samples and further work determined that the test could be used to diagnose multiple respiratory infections.In the study, the researchers began by labeling viruses with single-stranded DNA in over 200 clinical samples from John Radcliffe Hospital. Images of labeled samples were captured using a commercial fluorescence microscope and processed by custom machine-learning software that is trained to recognize specific viruses by analyzing their fluorescence labels, which show up differently for every virus because their surface size, shape and chemistry vary.The results show the technology is able to rapidly identify different types and strains of respiratory viruses, including flu and COVID-19, within five minutes and with >97% accuracy.Point-of-care testingIn 2021, Nicolas Shiaelis and Dr. Robb founded University of Oxford spin-out Pictura Bio that now licenses the technology. \"Our aim at Pictura Bio is to turn the method into a diagnostic test by creating a dedicated imager and single-use cartridge for use in point-of-care testing, with limited input from the user,\" explains Nicolas Shiaelis. \"We are also expanding the number of viruses that the models are trained on and will eventually start looking at other pathogens, such as bacteria and fungi, in respiratory samples, blood and urine.\"Dr. Robb continues, \"Cases of respiratory infections in winter 2022/23 have hit record-breaking highs, increasing the number of people seeking medical help. This combined with the COVID-19 backlog, staff shortages, tighter budgets and an aging population puts the NHS and its workforce under immense and unsustainable pressure.\"Quick, cost-effective and accurate\"Our simplified method of diagnostic testing is quicker and more cost-effective, accurate and future proof than any other tests currently available. If we want to detect a new virus, all we need to do is retrain the software to recognize it, rather than develop a whole new test. Our findings demonstrate the potential for this method to revolutionize viral diagnostics and our ability to control the spread of respiratory illnesses.\"Nicolas Shiaelis concludes, \"It is inevitable that other COVID-like viruses will emerge. This reinforces the need for more advanced diagnostic testing technology so that we can reduce the impact of new viruses on public health and the NHS.\" More information:Nicolas Shiaelis et al, Virus Detection and Identification in Minutes Using Single-Particle Imaging and Deep Learning, ACS Nano (2022).

The development and application of an RA high-sensitivity theranostics probe can help to accurately monitor the progression and realize the efficient treatment of RA.          In a study published in Advanced Science, a research group led by Prof. Zhang Yun from Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter of the Chinese Academy of Sciences developed a dual-triggered theranostics nanoprobe based on persistent luminescence nanoparticles (PLNPs) for RA autofluorescence-free imaging-guided precise treatment and therapeutic evaluation.The researchers first prepared a renewable near-infrared (NIR)-emitting Zn1.3Ga1.4Sn0.3O4:0.5%Cr3+,0.3%Y3+ (ZGSO) PLNPs by a facile mesoporous silica template method.By drug co-loading and surface modification, they then constructed ZGSO as a targeted theranostics nanoprobe with a good ability to control drug release via NIR/pH-responsive processes.In the adjuvant-induced RA model, such a theranostics nanoprobe efficiently targets the RA lesion site and performs the effective noninvasive diagnosis of RA joint tissues with high signal-to-background ratio.Remarkably, by persistent luminescence (PersL) imaging to guide precision treatment, the researchers found that the progress of RA was significantly suppressed.Additionally, they employed PersL imaging characteristics of the theranostics nanoprobe for RA therapeutic evaluation. The results were consistent with clinical micro-CT and histological analyses.This study provides an efficient and non-invasive RA diagnosis and treatment strategy, which is of great significance for effectively monitoring and controlling the development process of RA to optimize the treatment strategy.

In a conference room overlooking Forest Park on a beautiful fall day, the team had one goal in mind: tackle the biggest infectious disease problem facing the world right then.          \"Srikanth and I had a vision of a simple, quantitative diagnostic tool, so we connected with infectious disease physicians here at WashU and asked them, 'What are the most important questions that could be answered if you could get really detailed information cheaply at the point of care?'\" said Genin, the Harold and Kathleen Faught Professor of Mechanical Engineering.\"Greg Storch told us that one of the most important challenges facing the field of infectious disease is finding a way to figure out quickly if a patient has a bacterial infection and should get antibiotics or has a viral infection, for which antibiotics will not be effective.\"Storch, MD, the Ruth L. Siteman Professor of Pediatrics at the School of Medicine, was interested in diseases that affect most people regularly\u2014colds, strep throat or the flu\u2014but that weren't getting as much research attention as rarer diseases. \"Even with great advances that have been made in infectious disease diagnostics, there is still a niche for tests that are simple, rapid and sensitive,\" Storch said. \"It would be especially powerful if they could provide quantitative information. Tests with these characteristics could be employed in sophisticated laboratories or in the field.\"Drawing on his years of experience in developing nanomaterials for applications in biology and medicine, Singamaneni, the Lilyan & E. Lisle Hughes Professor, sought to overcome these limitations in point-of-care diagnostic tests. Singamaneni and his lab developed ultrabright fluorescent nanolabels called plasmonic-fluors, which could be quickly integrated into a common testing platform, the lateral flow assay (LFA).Plasmon-enhanced LFAs (p-LFAs) improve inexpensive, readily available rapid tests to levels of sensitivity required by physicians for confidence in test results without the need for lab-based confirmation.According to findings published Feb. 2 in Nature Biomedical Engineering, the team's p-LFAs are 1,000 times more sensitive than conventional LFAs, which show results via a visual color and fluorescence signal on the strip. When analyzed using a fluorescence scanner, p-LFAs are also substantially faster than gold-standard lab tests, returning results in only 20 minutes instead of several hours, with comparable or improved sensitivity. The p-LFAs can detect and quantify concentrations of proteins, enabling them to detect bacterial and viral infections as well as markers of inflammation that point to other diseases.      \"Plasmonic-fluors are composed of metal nanoparticles that serve as antennae to pull in the light and enhance the fluorescence emission of molecular fluorophores, thus making it an ultrabright nanoparticle,\" Singamaneni explained.\"Our p-LFAs can pick up even very small concentrations of antibodies and antigens, typical markers of infection, and give clinicians clear, quick results without the need for specialized equipment. For quantitative testing beyond the initial screening, the same LFA strip can be scanned with a fluorescence reader, enabling rapid and ultrasensitive colorimetric and fluorometric detection of disease markers with only one test.\"\"It's like turning up the volume on standard color-changing test strips. Instead of getting a faint line indicating only a positive or negative result, the new p-LFAs give clearer results with fewer particles, enabling one to move from simply 'yes or no?' to exactly 'how much?' with the aid of an inexpensive, portable scanner,\" said Jeremiah Morrissey, a research professor in anesthesiology in the Division of Clinical and Translational Research at the School of Medicine. Morrissey is a co-author of the new study and a long-term collaborator with the Singamaneni lab.This improved testing capability has obvious benefits for a population now all too familiar with the need for quick and reliable test results and the risk of false negatives.\"When we took on this problem in 2019, we thought our biggest challenge would be getting an adequate number of samples from sick people,\" Genin recalled. \"Where on Earth could we find a massive set of samples from patients whose symptoms were carefully documented and whose diagnosis was verified by slow and expensive PCR tests?\" In a matter of months, COVID-19 would erase that obstacle while introducing a whole host of new challenges and opportunities.\"The pandemic was a big shift for us, like it was for everyone,\" said first author Rohit Gupta, who worked on the p-LFA study as a graduate student in Singamaneni's lab and is now a senior scientist at Pfizer. \"We had to move away from our original focus on distinguishing viruses from bacteria, but it turned out to be an opportunity to do practical science with real stakes. We were working with epidemiologists to get samples for testing, with diagnosticians to compare our test to what was available, and with clinicians to gain insights into the real needs for patient care.\"Input from the entire collaboration helped Gupta and Singamaneni refine the design of the p-LFAs, which ultimately achieved 95% clinical sensitivity and 100% specificity for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and antigens. Genin described the results as stunning.\"We didn't know it was going to work so well,\" he said. \"We knew it would be good, but we didn't know this $1 test with a $300 readout device would be so much better\u201410 times better\u2014than state of the art that we all used during the COVID pandemic.\"Now that they've proven p-LFAs can outperform standard lab tests in sensitivity, speed, convenience and cost for one disease, the team is looking to develop new applications for the technology, including returning to their original goal of identifying bacterial versus viral infections and getting their diagnostic tool into the hands of physicians around the world.The p-LFA technology has been licensed to Auragent Bioscience LLC by Washington University's Office of Technology Management. Singamaneni and Morrissey are among the co-founders of Auragent, a WashU startup.\"We expect to have p-LFAs commercially available in the next one to two years,\" Singamaneni said. \"Right now, we're working on improving our portable scanner technology, which adds a more sensitive, fluorescent reading capability to the test strips in addition to the color change that can be seen with the naked eye. We think we can get that cost down to a point where it's accessible to rural clinics in the U.S. and abroad, which was one of our original goals.\"\"We're also excited about the potential to detect many more diseases than COVID, possibly using a skin patch that can take a painless sample,\" Singamaneni added. \"This technology has the potential to detect any number of diseases, ranging from STIs to respiratory infections and more, as well as cytokines indicative of inflammation seen in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and sepsis.\" More information:Rohit Gupta et al, Ultrasensitive lateral-flow assays via plasmonically active antibody-conjugated fluorescent nanoparticles, Nature Biomedical Engineering (2023).

The study was published in ACS Nano on Jan. 30.Lithium-sulfur batteries are promising energy storage systems due to their high theoretic capacity and specific energy. However, polysulfide shuttling leads to the decay of batteries, limiting their practical applications.Catalysts can accelerate the conversion of polysulfides and relatively suppress the shuttling, which serves as the effective approach to improving cyclability of Li-S batteries. The lack of understanding of the catalytic mechanism and origin poses an obstacle to the design of Li-S catalysts.\"Compared with NiAs, cations in MnP-type compounds shift along the plane vertical to c-axis, leading to the shortened inter-center distance of two-edge polyhedra and enhancing the metal-metal bonding,\" said Zhang Huigang, a principal investigator at IPE. Their electronic structures changed with the coordinated polyhedra. The resultant upshift or downshift of d-band would determine the bonding of catalysts and polysulfides.\"By tuning the coordination structure of active centers and optimizing the d-orbitals, we can design catalysts more rationally,\" said Prof. Zhu.Based on the transition, the researchers doped CoP with sulfur and distorted the [CoP6] polyhedra to shift the cation centers. As a result, the dz2 orbital shifted down and the dxz/dyz orbital moved up, enhancing the bonding toward polysulfides.To realize practical applications of high-loading Li-S batteries, they electrospun CoPxS1-x inside porous carbon nanofibers, forming chain-like nanoreactors, which confined and effectively catalyzed the polysulfide conversion reaction.\"The catalyst design and nanofiber construction enable excellent cyclability of high-loading Li-S batteries,\" said Zhang.

  "text": "Lithium-ion batteries have transformed everyday lives\u2014almost everyone has a smartphone, more electric vehicles can be spotted on the roads, and they keep power generators going during emergencies. As more portable electronic devices, electric vehicles and large-scale grid implementations come online, the demand for higher energy density batteries that are safe and affordable continues to grow.          Now, a University of Houston research team, in collaboration with researchers from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, has developed an operando reflection interference microscope (RIM) that provides a better understanding of how batteries work, which has significant implications for the next generation of batteries.\"We have achieved real-time visualization of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) dynamics for the first time,\" said Xiaonan Shan, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at UH's Cullen College of Engineering and corresponding author of a study published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology. \"This provides key insight into the rational design of interphases, a battery component that has been the least understood and most challenging barrier to developing electrolytes for future batteries.\"The highly sensitive microscope allows researchers to study the SEI layer, which is an extremely thin and fragile layer on the battery electrode surface that determines battery performance. Its chemical composition and morphology are continuously changing\u2014making it a challenge to study.\"A dynamic, non-invasive and high sensitivity operando imaging tool is required to understand the formation and evolution of SEI. Such a technique capable of direct probing SEI has been rare and highly desirable,\" said Yan Yao, the Hugh Roy and Lillie Cranz Cullen Distinguished Professor of electrical and computer engineering and a co-corresponding author who has worked with Shan on this project for the last four years.\"We have now demonstrated that RIM is the first of its kind to provide critical insight into the working mechanism of the SEI layer and help design better high-performance batteries,\" said Yao, who is also the principal investigator of the Texas Center for Superconductivity at UH.How it worksThe research team applied the principle of interference reflection microscopy in the project, where the light beam\u2014centering at 600 nanometers with spectrum width of about 10 nanometers\u2014was directed towards the electrodes and SEI layers and reflected. The collected optical intensity contains interference signals between different layers, carrying important information about the evolution process of SEI and allowing the researchers to observe the entire reaction process.\"The RIM is very sensitive to surface variations, which enables us to monitor the same location with large-scale high spatial and temporal resolution,\" said UH graduate student Guangxia Feng, who performed much of the experimental work on the project.The researchers note that most battery researchers currently use cryo-electron microscopes, which only take one picture at a certain time and cannot continuously track the changes at the same location.\"I wanted to approach energy research from a different angle by adapting and developing new characterization and imaging methods which provide new information to understand the reaction mechanism in energy conversion processes,\" said Shan, who specializes in developing imaging techniques and spectrometry techniques to study electrochemical reactions in energy storage and conversions. This new imaging technique could also be applied to other state-of-the-art energy storage systems.Feng, who earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from UH in 2022, plans to pursue further research in the growing field of battery technology.\"To realize the next generation of batteries, it is essential to understand the reaction mechanisms and novel materials,\" she said, adding that developing higher energy batteries also benefits the environment. \"I have always wanted to be a scientist because they can make great things happen for people and change the world for the better.\" More information:Kang Xu, Imaging solid\u2013electrolyte interphase dynamics using operando reflection interference microscopy, Nature Nanotechnology (2023).

  "text": "\"Every act of creation,\" Picasso famously noted, \"is first an act of destruction.\"          Taking this concept literally, researchers in Canada have now discovered that \"breaking\" molecular nanomachines basic to life can create new ones that work even better.Their findings are published today in Nature Chemistry.Evolved over millions of yearsLife on Earth is made possible by tens of thousands of nanomachines that have evolved over millions of years. Often made of proteins or nucleic acids, they typically contain thousands of atoms and are less than 10,000 times the size of a human hair.\"These nanomachines control all molecular activities in our body, and problems with their regulation or structure are at the origin of most human diseases,\" said the new study's principal investigator Alexis Vall\u00e9e-B\u00e9lisle, a chemistry professor at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al.Studying the way these nanomachines are built, Vall\u00e9e-B\u00e9lisle, holder of the Canada Research Chair in Bioengineering and Bio-Nanotechnology, noticed that while some are made using a single component or part (often long biopolymers), others use several components that spontaneously assemble.\"Since most of my students spend their lives creating nanomachines, we started to wonder if it is more beneficial to create them using one or more self-assembling molecular components,\" said Vall\u00e9e-B\u00e9lisle.                Graphical abstract. Credit: Nature Chemistry (2023). DOI: 10.1038/s41557-022-01127-4             A 'destructive' ideaTo explore this question, his doctoral student Dominic Lauzon, had the \"destructive\" idea of breaking up some nanomachines to see if they could be reassembled. To do so, he made artificial DNA-based nanomachines that could be \"destroyed\" by breaking them up.\"DNA is a remarkable molecule that offers simple, programmable and easy-to-use chemistry,\" said Lauzon, the study's first author. \"We believed that DNA-based nanomachines could help answer fundamental questions about the creation and evolution of natural and human-made nanomachines.\"Lauzon and Vall\u00e9e-B\u00e9lisle spent years performing the experimental validations. They were able to demonstrate that nanomachines could easily withstand fragmentation, but more importantly, that such a destructive event allowed for the creation of various novel functionalities, including different sensitivity levels towards variation in component concentration, temperature and mutations.What the researchers found is that these functionalities could arise simply by controlling the concentration of each individual component. For example, when cutting a nanomachine in three components, nanomachines were found to activate more sensitively at high concentration of components. In contrast, at low concentration of components, nanomachines could be programmed to activate or deactivate at specific moment in time or to simply inhibit their function.\"Overall, these novel functionalities were created by simply cutting up, or destroying, the structure of an existing nanomachine,\" said Lauzon. \"These functionalities could drastically improve human-based nanotechnologies such as sensors, drug carriers and even molecular computers.\"      Evolving new functionalitiesJust as Picasso typically destroyed dozens of unfinished works to create his famous artworks, and just like muscles need to break down to get stronger, and innovative new companies are born by eliminating older competitors from the market, nanoscale machines can evolve new functionalities by being taken apart.Unlike common machines like cell phones, televisions and cars, which are made by combining components using screws and bolts, glue, solder or electronics, \"nanomachines rely on thousands of weak dynamic intermolecular forces that can spontaneously reform, enabling broken nanomachines to re-assemble,\" said Vall\u00e9e-B\u00e9lisle.In addition to providing nanotechnology researchers with a simple design strategy to create the next generation of nanomachines, the UdeM team's findings also shed light on how natural molecular nanomachines may have evolved.\"Biologists have recently discovered that about 20 percent of biological nanomachines may have evolved through the fragmentation of their genes,\" said Vall\u00e9e-B\u00e9lisle. \"With our results, biologists now have a rational basis for understanding how the fragmentation of these ancestral proteins could have created new molecular functionalities for life on Earth.\" More information:Alexis Vall\u00e9e-B\u00e9lisle, Functional advantages of building nanosystems using multiple molecular components, Nature Chemistry (2023).

  "text": "Antiferroelectric materials have electrical properties that make them advantageous for use in high-density energy storage applications. Researchers have now discovered a size threshold beyond which antiferroelectrics lose those properties, becoming ferroelectric.          \"Electronic devices are getting smaller and smaller, which makes it increasingly important for us to understand how a material's properties may change at small scales,\" says Ruijuan Xu, corresponding author of a paper on the work and an assistant professor of materials science and engineering at North Carolina State University.\"In this case, we learned that when antiferroelectric thin films get too thin, these materials go through a phase transition and become ferroelectric. That makes them less useful for energy storage, but creates some new application possibilities for memory storage.\"This research focused on antiferroelectric materials. These materials have a crystalline structure, which means they consist of regularly repeating units. Each repeating unit in the crystalline structure has a \"dipole\"\u2014a positive charge paired with a negative charge. What makes antiferroelectric materials special is that those dipoles alternate from unit to unit throughout the structure.In other words, if one unit has a positive charge on \"top\" and a negative charge on the \"bottom,\" then the next unit will have the positive charge on the \"bottom\" and the negative charge on \"top.\" This regular spacing of the dipoles also means that, at the macroscale, antiferroelectric materials have no positive or negative polarization.Ferroelectric materials also have a crystalline structure. But in ferroelectrics, the dipoles in the repeating units all point the same way. What's more, you can reverse the polarization of the dipoles in ferroelectric materials by applying an electric field.To explore how an antiferroelectric material's properties may change at small scales, the researchers focused on lead-free sodium niobate (NaNbO3) membranes.Antiferroelectric thin films are grown on a substrate. Previous attempts to assess potential size-related effects on antiferroelectric thin films have looked at the thin films while the films are still attached to the substrate layer. This poses significant challenges, because there are \"strains\" where the thin film is strongly connected to the substrate\u2014and it is difficult to assess what effects are related to the thin film's size and what effects are caused by the strains related to the substrate.      \"To address this challenge, we introduced a sacrificial buffer layer between the antiferroelectric thin film and the substrate,\" Xu says. \"Once we had grown the thin film to the desired thickness, we selectively etched the sacrificial layer. This allowed us to detach the thin film from the substrate. Ultimately, this allowed us to determine how any changes in the thin film are affected by its size, because we knew the substrate was not contributing to any changes.\"The researchers then used a variety of experimental and theoretical approaches to assess these strain-free samples at thicknesses ranging from 9 nanometers (nm) to 164 nm.\"The results were quite unexpected,\" Xu says.\"We know that at the atomic scale, antiferroelectric materials\u2014like lead-free NaNbO3 membranes\u2014have alternating dipoles throughout the material. We found that when the NaNbO3 membranes were thinner than 40 nm, they become completely ferroelectric. And from 40 nm to 164 nm, we found that the material had some regions that were ferroelectric, while other regions were antiferroelectric.\"Using their experimental data, the researchers extrapolated there would be at least some ferroelectric regions in the NaNbO3 at any thickness below 270 nm.\"One of the exciting things we found was that when the thin films were in the range where there were both ferroelectric and antiferroelectric regions, we could make the antiferroelectric regions ferroelectric by applying an electric field,\" Xu says. \"And this change was not reversible. In other words, we could make the thin film completely ferroelectric at thicknesses of up to 164 nm.\"The researchers were also able to draw some conclusions on what is driving these changes in the antiferroelectric material.\"Drawing on first principles, we were able to conclude that the phase changes we see in exceptionally thin antiferroelectric materials are driven by structural distortion that begins on the membrane's surface,\" Xu says.In other words, instabilities at the surface have a ripple effect that runs throughout the material\u2014which isn't possible when the volume of the material is higher. That's what prevents antiferroelectric materials from becoming ferroelectric at larger scales.\"I don't want to speculate too much about potential applications, but our work offers significant insights into how we can control a material's properties by taking advantage of size effects,\" Xu says. \"We've demonstrated significant size effects in NaNbO3, and the techniques we used to uncover those effects can be used to explore similar questions for a range of other materials.\"The paper, \"Size-Induced Ferroelectricity in Antiferroelectric Oxide Membranes,\" is published open access in the journal Advanced Materials.

  "text": "For all of the unparalleled, parallel-processing, still-indistinguishable-from-magic wizardry packed into the three pounds of an adult human brain, it obeys the same rule as the other living tissue it controls: Oxygen is a must.          So it was with a touch of irony that Evgeny Tsymbal offered his explanation for a technological wonder\u2014movable, data-covered walls mere atoms wide\u2014that may eventually help computers behave more like a brain.\"There was unambiguous evidence that oxygen vacancies are responsible for this,\" said Tsymbal, George Holmes University Professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln.In partnership with colleagues in China and Singapore, Tsymbal and a few Husker alumni have demonstrated how to construct, control and explain the oxygen-deprived walls of a nanoscopically thin material suited to next-gen electronics. The team detailed its findings in the journal Nature.Unlike most digital data-writing and -reading techniques, which speak only the binary of ones and zeroes, these walls can talk in several electronic dialects that could allow the devices housing them to store even more data. Like synapses in the brain, the passage of electrical spikes sent via the walls can depend on which signals have passed through before, lending them an adaptability and energy efficiency more akin to human memory. And much as brains maintain memories even when their users sleep, the walls can retain their data states even if their devices turn off\u2014a precursor to electronics that power back on with the speed and simplicity of a light.The team investigated the barrier-smashing walls in a nanomaterial, named bismuth ferrite, that can be sliced thousands of times thinner than a human hair. Bismuth ferrite also boasts a rare quality known as ferroelectricity: The polarization, or separation, of its positive and negative electric charges can be flipped by applying just a pinch of voltage, writing a one or zero in the process. Contrary to conventional DRAM, a dynamic random-access memory that needs to be refreshed every few milliseconds, that 1 or 0 remains even when the voltage is removed, granting it the equivalent of long-term memory that DRAM lacks.Usually, that polarization is read as a one or zero, and flipped to rewrite it as a zero or one, in a region of material called a domain. Two oppositely polarized domains meet to form a wall, which occupies just a fraction of the space dedicated to the domains themselves. The few-atom thickness of those walls, and the unusual properties that sometimes emerge in or around them, have cast them as prime suspects in the search for new ways to squeeze ever-more functionality and storage into shrinking devices.      Still, walls that run parallel to the surface of a ferroelectric material\u2014and net an electric charge usable in data processing and storage\u2014have proven difficult to find, let alone regulate or create. But about four years ago, Tsymbal began talking with Jingsheng Chen from the National University of Singapore and He Tian from China's Zhejiang University. At the time, Tian and some colleagues were pioneering a technique that allowed them to apply voltage on an atomic scale, even as they recorded atom-by-atom displacements and dynamics in real time.Ultimately, the team found that applying just 1.5 volts to a bismuth ferrite film yielded a domain wall parallel to the material's surface\u2014one with a specific resistance to electricity whose value could be read as a data state. When voltage was withdrawn, the wall, and its data state, remained.When the team cranked up the voltage, the domain wall began migrating down the material, a behavior seen in other ferroelectrics. Whereas the walls in those other materials had then propagated perpendicular to the surface, though, this one remained parallel. And unlike any of its predecessors, the wall adopted a glacial pace, migrating just one atomic layer at a time. Its position, in turn, corresponded with changes in its electrical resistance, which dropped in three distinct steps\u2014three more readable data states\u2014that emerged between the application of 8 and 10 volts.The researchers had nailed down a few W's\u2014the what, the where, the when\u2014critical to eventually employing the phenomenon in electronic devices. But they were still missing one. Tsymbal, as it happened, was among the few people qualified to address it.\"There was a puzzle,\" Tsymbal said. \"Why does it happen? And this is where theory helped.\"Most domain walls are electrically neutral, possessing neither a positive nor a negative charge. That's with good reason: A neutral wall requires little energy to maintain its electric state, effectively making it the default. The domain wall the team identified in the ultra-thin bismuth ferrite, by contrast, possessed a substantial charge. And that, Tsymbal knew, should have kept it from stabilizing and persisting. Yet somehow, it was managing to do just that, seeming to flout the rules of condensed-matter physics.There had to be an explanation. In his prior research, Tsymbal and colleagues had found that the departure of negatively charged oxygen atoms, and the positively charged vacancies they left in their wake, could impede a technologically useful outcome. This time, Tsymbal's theory-backed calculations suggested the opposite\u2014that the positively charged vacancies were compensating for other negative charges accumulating at the wall, essentially fortifying it in the process.Experimental measurements from the team would later show that the distribution of charges in the material lined up almost exactly with the location of the domain wall, exactly as the calculations had predicted. If oxygen vacancies turn up in other ferroelectric playgrounds, Tsymbal said, they could prove vital to better understanding and engineering devices that incorporate the prized class of materials.\"From my perspective, that was the most exciting,\" said Tsymbal, who undertook the research with support from the university's quantum-focused EQUTE project. \"This links ferroelectricity with electrochemistry. We have some kind of electrochemical processes\u2014namely, the motion of oxygen vacancies\u2014which basically control the motion of these domain walls.\"I think that this mechanism is very important, because what most people are doing\u2014including us, theoretically\u2014is looking at pristine materials, where polarization switches up and down, and studying what happens with the resistance. All the experimental interpretations of this behavior were based on this simple picture of polarization. But here, it's not only the polarization. It involves some chemical processes inside of it.\" More information:Zhongran Liu et al, In-plane charged domain walls with memristive behaviour in a ferroelectric film, Nature (2023).

  "text": "National University of Singapore chemists have discovered that aggregated, photosensitized, gold nanoparticle conjugates can be used for multimodal imaging and synergistic phototherapy to destroy cancer cells effectively at power densities below the skin tolerance threshold. The research is published in the journal Nano Today.          Phototherapy techniques such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) have generated extensive interest as promising therapeutic techniques for the treatment of cancer because of their minimal invasiveness. In PDT, photosensitizers are activated to produce reactive oxygen species to destroy cancer cells upon light irradiation.For PTT, a photothermal agent is used to absorb and convert light radiation energy into heat to destroy cancer cells. However, conventional PDT suffers from the \"always-on\" mode with severe post-treatment side effects and inefficient generation of reactive oxygen species. PTT treatment also has several disadvantages such as unnecessary damage caused by overheating and relatively low efficiency in the delivery of photothermal agents to the targeted site.A research team led by Prof Xu Qing-Hua from the Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore, designed an aggregation-induced emission enhancement scheme for the photosensitizer, which is based on conjugated metal nanoparticles. These nanoparticles display multimodal imaging capabilities and have highly efficient PDT/PTT synergetic therapy effects in their aggregated form.In this approach, aggregates of Chlorin e6 conjugated gold nanoparticles were demonstrated to display significantly enhanced one- and two-photon excitation fluorescence, singlet oxygen generation and photothermal effects. The photoactivity of the photosensitizers was first suppressed by attaching them to gold nanoparticles but it became significantly enhanced when they formed aggregates. In addition to increased brightness, the photostability of the nanoparticle aggregate improved significantly when compared to their non-aggregated form. This is due to the shortened lifetime of the molecules in their excited state.Based on their findings, the researchers have demonstrated multimodal imaging and synergistic phototherapy using HeLa cancer cells under laboratory conditions. By forming aggregates in-situ inside cancer cells, the nanoparticle aggregates act as fluorescence imaging probes under one- and two-photon excitation using red and near-infrared light, respectively. These nanoparticle aggregates also displayed excellent PDT and PTT performance, which can effectively destroy cancer cells by using red light lasers with power density that is below the skin tolerance threshold due to the synergistic therapy effects.Prof Xu said, \"This plasmonic nanosystem, which is based on a new type of aggregation-induced emission phenomenon, offers a promising technique for imaging guided PDT/PTT synergetic therapy. This could potentially open up a new venue to explore safe, accurate and noninvasive theranostics.\" More information:Sichao Tian et al, Aggregation enhanced photoactivity of photosensitizer conjugated metal nanoparticles for multimodal imaging and synergistic phototherapy below skin tolerance threshold, Nano Today (2022).

  "text": "A team of researchers, including members from the University of Connecticut, has developed a nanoparticle-based treatment that targets multiple culprits in glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive and deadly form of brain cancer.          The results, a collaboration between UConn and Yale University, were published today in Science Advances.The new treatment uses bioadhesive nanoparticles that adhere to the site of the tumor and then slowly release the synthesized peptide nucleic acids that they're carrying. These peptide nucleic acids target certain microRNAs\u2014that is, short strands of RNA that play a role in gene expression. Specifically, they're directed at a type of overexpressed microRNA known as \"oncomiRs\" that lead to the proliferation of cancer cells and growth of the tumor. When the peptide nucleic acids attach to the oncomiRs, they stop their tumor-promoting activity.The laboratories of professors Raman Bahal of the UConn School of Pharmacy and Mark Saltzman of Yale collaborated on the treatment system. Unlike similar efforts, which target only one oncomiR at a time, this treatment targets two, making its effect on cancer cells stronger. The test mice who received the treatment lived for a significantly longer time than the control mice.\"It can knock down both targets at the same time, which turns out to have a remarkably more powerful result, as we saw with the increased survival results,\" says Saltzman, a professor of biomedical engineering, chemical and environmental engineering, and physiology. \"These results are the best I've ever seen in this sort of aggressive brain tumor.\"One challenge in developing the treatment was designing the anti-cancer agents, known as antimiRs, so that two different ones could fit in a single nanoparticle.\"We synthesized all these compounds and came up with the idea that you don't have to target one oncomiR at a time,\" says Bahal, an associate professor of pharmaceutics. \"Now we can think about multiple oncomiR targets.\"For this work, the researchers targeted the oncomiRs known as miR-10b and miR-21, which are both very common in glioblastoma. Future treatments, though, can be easily tailored for specific patients. For instance, if a biopsy of a patient's tumor produces a profile showing the proliferation of different oncomiRs, the treatment could be appropriately altered.                s\u03b3PNA-mediated simultaneous knockdown of miR-21 and miR-10b in multiple glioma cells.

DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abq7459             Saltzman calls the treatment \"a marriage of two technologies.\"\"One is the bioadhesive nanoparticle technology, which we had developed earlier, and marrying it to this peptide nucleic acid technology that Raman has perfected,\" he says.Because the treatment is localized to the tumor site, Bahal noted that both the synthesized nucleic acids and the nanoparticles that deliver them to the tumor site are non-toxic. Also critical to the treatment's success is that the particles and the agent it releases remain at the tumor site for about 40 days. Conventional site-specific treatments tend to wash away fairly quickly.\"These are high-binding molecules that are scalable and effective simultaneously,\" says Bahal. \"It's targeted and stays there. Traditional molecules have had many challenges in terms of toxicity.\"Ideally, the delivery system would be applied as part of a larger treatment regimen.\"We designed it to be an add-on to what physicians do already,\" Saltzman says. \"They would do a surgery, then they infuse our nanoparticles, and then they give chemotherapy and/or radiation in the way that they normally do. We're expecting that this would lead to a better result because the nanoparticle/anti-microRNA is sensitizing the cells to the chemotherapy and the radiation therapy.\"The study's other authors include Shipra Malik, a former graduate student in Bahal's lab; and Vijender Singh, Associate Director of Computational Biology Core at UConn.\"This study opens new avenues for RNA-targeted technology in developing personalized therapy for brain cancer,\" says Malik.

  "text": "Hydrogen fuel could be a more viable alternative to traditional fossil fuels, according to University of Surrey researchers who have found that a type of metal-free catalyst could contribute to the development of cost-effective and sustainable hydrogen production technologies. The findings are published in the journal ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.          The study has shown promising results for the use of edge-decorated nanocarbons as metal-free catalysts for the direct conversion of methane, which is also a powerful greenhouse gas, into hydrogen. Among the nanocarbons investigated, nitrogen-doped nanocarbons presented the highest level of performance for hydrogen production at high temperatures.Crucially, the researchers also found that the nitrogen-doped and phosphorous-doped nanocarbons had strong resistance to carbon poisoning, which is a common issue with catalysts in this process.Dr. Neubi Xavier Jr., the research fellow who performed the material science simulations, said, \"Our results suggest that using edge-decorated nanocarbons as catalysts could be a game-changer for the hydrogen industry, offering a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to traditional metal catalysts. At the same time, this process gets rid of methane, which is a fossil fuel involved in global warming.\"Hydrogen fuel is a clean and renewable energy source that has the potential to reduce carbon emissions and decrease our dependence on fossil fuels. When used as a fuel, hydrogen can power vehicles, generate electricity, and heat buildings. The only by-product of hydrogen fuel is water vapor, making it an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuels.However, the production of hydrogen fuel is currently reliant on fossil fuels, which creates carbon emissions in the process, and metal catalysts, which mining and manufacturing are energy intensive and can negatively affect the environment. Therefore, the development of sustainable hydrogen production methods and catalytic materials is crucial to realizing the full potential of hydrogen fuel as a clean energy source.The research was conducted by a team led by Dr. Marco Sacchi from the University of Surrey, an expert in the field of sustainable energy and computational chemistry, who combined quantum chemistry, thermodynamics and chemical kinetics to determine the most efficient edge decoration for hydrogen production.Dr. Sacchi said, \"One of the biggest challenges with catalysts for hydrogen production is that they can get poisoned by carbon.

  "answer_squad": " Advanced Science",
  "text": "A group led by Prof. Horacio Cabral, in collaboration with a group led by Prof. Kazuhiro Kakimi, discovered a new way to improve cancer immunotherapy. Their findings are published in a paper, titled \"An IL-12-Based Nanocytokine Safely Potentiates Anticancer Immunity through Spatiotemporal Control of Inflammation to Eradicate Advanced Cold Tumors,\" in Advanced Science.          Many solid tumors have immunosuppressive microenvironment, which prevents the infiltration, activation, and effector function of immune cells, resulting an immunologically cold tumor phenotype that is insensitive to immunotherapy conducted by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including the famous anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies.Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is one of the strongest pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, there is a major interest to use it for enhancing the immunity in tumors and improving the response rates of immunotherapies. However, IL-12 is extremely toxic due to systemic immune activation and shows limited clinical efficacy under safe dose. To solve such problem, here an IL-12-based nanocytokine that can control the immune activation function of IL-12 based on intratumoral pH were developed to realize a tumor-targeted immunity enhancement.Based on pH-sensitive polymer materials, the nanocytokine can sense the pH in tumors to unleash the fully active cytokine. As a result, the nanocytokine avoids the systemic response mediated by IL-12 and diminishes the side effects. In murine triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) model, the nanocytokine enhances the immunity and elevates the immune cells' infiltration level in the tumor. The nanocytokine also infuses potency to ICIs, completely eradicating both primary and metastatic tumors.What is the novelty of this study?IL-12 has long been investigated as potential anti-cancer agents but its strong toxicity and insufficient therapeutic efficacy under maximum tolerated dose were illustrated by early-stage clinical trials and called for strategies to solve such problem before its application. The nanocytokine formulation is the first example of polymer-based switchable IL-12 delivery system, and in the results of this study, it was found that:A polymer-based nanocytokine formulation can stably control the \"off\" and \"on\" state of IL-12's bioactivity by sensing the pH difference between healthy organs and tumor.The tumor-targeted activation of the nanocytokine leads to spatiotemporal control of the immune reactions mediated by IL-12. In healthy tissues, the off-target immune activation and counteractive reactions are diminished, meanwhile in tumor, the inflammatory responses are enhanced.The nanocytokine profoundly inflames cold tumors from the gene expression level and synergize with ICIs to completely eradicate advanced primary and metastatic tumors.Why are these findings important and how is the study going to improve the current therapy?Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is one of the strongest pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, there is a major interest to use it for inflaming tumors and increasing the response rates of immunotherapies. Nevertheless, IL-12 is extremely toxic due to systemic immune activation, and shows limited clinical efficacy, even at its maximum tolerated dose (MTD), because its spatiotemporal inflammatory dynamics trigger counteracting immune reactions.While big efforts are being dedicated to engineer IL-12 protein for increasing its safety and tumor selectivity, these approaches fall short in overcoming IL-12's issues, as they could still induce systemic inflammation, promote interfering anti-inflammatory signals and, in many cases, present lower equimolar activity than native IL-12. Unfortunately, the inflammatory dynamics for such protein-engineered systems are still poorly understood, and the promotion of counteractive secondary responses remains unclear.The IL-12-based nanocytokine solves the said issues at once by promoting the spatiotemporal control of the inflammation through high tumor accumulation, high and selective intratumoral immune activity and regulated interaction with the systemic immunity. Thus, nanocytokine controlled the inflammation is a spatiotemporal manner.It blocked the systemic immune response and avoided the onset of adaptive anti-inflammatory signals after repeated injection, e.g., the expansion of interleukin-10 (IL-10), which are commonly observed after the second injection of IL-12 or standard IL-12-based systems, such as fusion proteins and immunocytokines. Such spatiotemporal control could be advantageous for realizing repeated administration schedules without the declining of the anti-tumor effects.The nanocytokine also expanded the therapeutic window of IL-12 through the spatiotemporal control of inflammation. Thus, the nanocytokine benefitted from the blocking of counteractive immune responses to decrease by 10-fold the effective dose against immunosuppressive triple negative breast cancer. Moreover, the nanocytokine enhanced the safety, and was non-toxic even at a dose that is 1,000-fold higher than the reported MTD of native IL-12 in human studies.The nanocytokine profoundly inflamed immunosuppressive tumors, avoiding the stimulation of immune responses that interfere with efficacy. This allowed the nanocytokine to strongly synergize with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) by reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.Notably, because the nanocytokine is based on biocompatible FDA-approved materials, the strategy holds high potential for clinical translation. In addition, the formulation could be extended to other therapeutic proteins, serving as a practical strategy for tumor-targeted delivery of biologics.

  "text": "A collaboration including scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Sandia National Laboratories, the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has created 3-4 nanometer ultrathin nanosheets of a metal hydride that increase hydrogen storage capacity. The research appears in the journal Small.          There is a need for sustainable energy storage technologies that can address the intermittent nature of renewable energy resources. Hydrogen-based technologies are promising long-term solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Hydrogen has the highest energy density of any fuel and is considered a viable solution for ground transportation, aircraft and marine vessels. However, hydrocarbon fuel sources outperform compressed hydrogen gas in terms of volumetric energy density, motivating the development of alternative, higher-density materials-based storage methods.Complex metal hydrides are a class of hydrogen storage materials that while having high absolute storage capacity, can require extreme pressures and temperatures to achieve that capacity. The team tackled this challenge by nano-sizing, which increases the surface area to react with hydrogen and decreases the required depth of hydrogenation. Previous studies have analyzed nanoscale magnesium diboride (MgB2), including work by LLNL, however, the material in that study was not as thin and wound up clustering together.The material created in this most recent collaboration came from solvent-free mechanical exfoliation in zirconia, yielding material that is only 11-12 atomic layers thick and can hydrogenate to about 50 times the capacity of the bulk material.This 50-fold increase in the hydrogenation neatly corresponds to a 50-fold increase in the surface to volume ratio, suggesting that both the bulk and nanosheet material hydrogenate approximately the first two layers, a universal behavior independent of particle size. For two layers on either side of the 11-12-layer nanomaterial, this represents a third of the maximum hydrogen capacity of MgB2.MgB2 consists of alternating magnesium and boron layers for which charge transfer from the magnesium layer to the boron layer drives the boron layer stability. LLNL calculations reveal that the incomplete Mg coverage on the surface of the material energetically favors a surface structure with islands of complete magnesium coverage and other areas of less stable disordered surface boron layers. Building from previous work on the disordering of surface boron layers, calculations show how magnesium coverage on MgB2 evolves as it hydrogenates.\"These results show how a reactive MgB2 surface with exposed boron may become more stable as it hydrogenates because the magnesium coverage increases,\" said LLNL physicist and author Keith Ray. \"By this mechanism the hydrogenation slows and halts for moderate hydrogenation conditions.\"Further nano-sizing or a novel chemical modification to delay or disrupt the increase in surface magnesium may further increase MgB2 performance as a hydrogen storage material,\" he added.

  "text": "Van der Waals heterostructures integrated from various two-dimensional (2D) layered materials provide fundamental building blocks for optoelectronic devices with novel functionalities, such as photovoltaic solar cells, light emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodetectors. Two-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional perovskites (abbreviated as 2D perovskites hereafter) exhibit unique properties, such as large exciton binding energy, high photoluminescence quantum efficiency, large oscillator strengths and long carrier diffusion length, and thus are emerging candidates for next-generation optoelectronic devices.          To this end, heterostructures incorporating distinct layered 2D perovskites with other layered or non-layered materials can introduce unique optical and optoelectronic properties and vastly expand the potential functionalities and applications of the heterostructures.Publishing in the International Journal of Extreme Manufacturing, the team led by researchers based at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology have summarized the recent achievements of 2D/quasi-2D perovskite-based heterostructures to facilitate the discovery of unexplored phenomena and open up a new range of optoelectronic applications.The team introduced the structure and physical properties of 2D/quasi-2D perovskites and then discussed the construction and characterization of 2D/quasi-2D perovskite-based heterostructures and also highlighted the prominent optical properties of the constructed heterostructures. Further, the potential applications of 2D/quasi-2D perovskite-based heterostructures in photovoltaic devices, light emitting devices, photodetectors/phototransistors and valleytronic devices were demonstrated. The challenges and perspectives in the field of 2D perovskites-based heterostructures were also outlined.The lead researcher, Professor Dehui Li, commented, \"The rich electronic and optical physics offered by 2D perovskites renders them to be very promising for optoelectronic applications. The electronic structure of 2D perovskites can be efficiently modulated by changing the layer number n value, substituting halide anions and incorporating organic chains, which further modifies their optical performances, bringing both advantages and disadvantages for optoelectronic applications.\"\"However, the synthesis of pure phase quasi-2D perovskites and heterostructures on a large scale in a controllable manner is still lacking. In this review, we summarized all developed methods to prepare 2D perovskite and heterostructures, which would be helpful to explore new strategies for material preparation.\"Heterostructure construction lay the foundation for optoelectronic device architectures and applications. Various techniques have been developed to build 2D perovskite heterostructures, including dry transfer, solution synthesis and vapor deposition. Besides, optical spectra, phase identification and surface morphology characterization are the common methods to characterize the constructed heterostructures.      Co-first author Dr. Haizhen Wang said, \"Optical property is one fascinating functional aspect of 2D perovskite-based heterostructures, which not only inherit the basic physical properties of 2D perovskites but also show rich new photophysics that does not exhibit in each constituent material.\"Thus, 2D perovskite-based heterostructures provide an ideal platform to study the charge/energy-transfer processes, ion migration-induced optical properties and nonlinear optical effects. Nevertheless, studies on those aspects remain at a preliminary stage and further investigations are called for.Co-first author Ph.D. student Yingying Chen said, \"2D perovskites can be stacked with other materials to establish heterostructures with different band alignments, which can be type I or type II based on different constituents in heterostructures leading to different optoelectronic applications.\"In this review, performances in photovoltaic devices, photodetectors, light-emitting devices, phototransistors and valleytronic devices based on various 2D perovskite heterostructures have been sorted and discussed.Prof. Dehui Li said, \"The excellent optical and optoelectronic properties of 2D perovskite-based heterostructures have led to a wide range of applications in optics and optoelectronics. However, many problems are still encountered at this stage, which include the rational synthesizing pure phase 2D perovskites and their heterostructures on large scale in a controllable manner, deeply understanding their fundamental physical properties as well as fully exploring their potential novel optoelectronic applications.\"\"We believe that more 2D perovskite-based heterostructures with novel functionalities will be constructed taking advantage of the great flexibility in composition, structure and properties of 2D perovskites.\" More information:Haizhen Wang et al, Two/Quasi-two-dimensional perovskite-based heterostructures: construction, properties and applications, International Journal of Extreme Manufacturing (2022).

  "answer_squad": " EVs",
  "text": "Researchers at Nagoya University in Japan have used a new device to identify a key membrane protein in urine that indicates whether the patient has a brain tumor. This protein could be used to detect brain cancer, avoiding the need for invasive tests, and increasing the likelihood of tumors being detected early enough for surgery. This research could also have potential implications for detecting other types of cancer. The research was published in ACS Nano.          Although early detection of many types of cancer has contributed to the recent increases in cancer survival rates, the survival rate for brain tumors has remained almost unchanged for over 20 years. Partly this is due to their late detection. Physicians often discover brain tumors only after the onset of neurological symptoms, such as loss of movement or speech, by which time the tumor has reached a considerable size. Detecting the tumor when it is still small, and starting treatment as soon as possible, should help to save lives.One possible sign that a person has a brain tumor is the presence of tumor-related extracellular vesicles (EVs) in their urine. EVs are nano-sized vesicles involved in a variety of functions, including cell-to-cell communication. Because those found in brain cancer patients have specific types of RNA and membrane proteins, they could be used to detect the presence of cancer and its progression.Although they are excreted far from the brain, many EVs from cancer cells exist stably and are excreted in the urine without breaking down. Urine testing has many advantages, explains Associate Professor Takao Yasui of Nagoya University Graduate School of Engineering. \"Liquid biopsy can be performed using many body fluids, but blood tests are invasive,\" he said. \"Urine tests are an effective, simple, and non-invasive method because the urine contains many informative biomolecules that can be traced back to identify the disease.\"A research group led by Yasui and Professor Yoshinobu Baba of Nagoya University's Graduate School of Engineering, in collaboration with Nagoya University's Institute of Innovation for Future Society and the University of Tokyo, has developed a new analysis platform for brain tumor EVs using nanowires at the bottom of a well plate. Using this device, they identified two specific types of EV membrane proteins, known as CD31/CD63, from urine samples of brain tumor patients. Looking for these tell-tale proteins could enable doctors to identify tumor patients before they develop symptoms.\"Currently, EV isolation and detection methods require more than two instruments and an assay to isolate and then detect EVs,\" said Yasui. \"The all-in-one nanowire assay can isolate and detect EVs using one simple procedure. In the future, users can run samples through our assay and change the detection part, by selectively modifying it to detect specific membrane proteins or miRNAs inside EVs to detect other types of cancer. Using this platform, we expect to advance the analysis of the expression levels of specific membrane proteins in patients' urinary EVs, which will enable the early detection of different types of cancer.\" More information:Kunanon Chattrairat et al, All-in-One Nanowire Assay System for Capture and Analysis of Extracellular Vesicles from an ex Vivo Brain Tumor Model, ACS Nano (2023).

  "text": "Waaahhh! While babies have a natural mechanism for alerting their parents that they need a diaper change, a new sensor developed by researchers at Penn State could help workers in daycares, hospitals and other settings provide more immediate care to their charges.          The new sensor\u2014so cheap and simple to produce that it can be hand-drawn with a pencil onto paper treated with sodium chloride\u2014could clear the way for wearable, self-powered health monitors for use not only in \"smart diapers\" but also to predict major health concerns like cardiac arrest and pneumonia.\"Our team has been focused on developing devices that can capture vital information for human health,\" said Huanyu \"Larry\" Cheng, the James L. Henderson, Jr. Memorial Associate Professor of Engineering Science and Mechanics at Penn State. \"The goal is early prediction for disease conditions and health situations, to spot problems before it is too late.\"Cheng is the lead author on a new study, published in the journal Nano Letters, which describes the design and fabrication process for a reliable, hand-drawn electrode sensor. The sensor is created using a pencil, drawn on paper treated with a sodium chloride solution. The hydration sensor is highly sensitive to changes in humidity and provides accurate readings over a wide range of relative humidity levels, from 5.6% to 90%.Research into wearable sensors has been gaining momentum because of their wide-ranging applications in medical health, disaster warning and military defense, Cheng explained. Flexible humidity sensors have become increasingly necessary in health care, for uses such as respiratory monitoring and skin humidity detection, but it is still challenging to achieve high sensitivity and easy disposal with simple, low-cost fabrication processes, he added.\"We wanted to develop something low-cost that people would understand how to make and use\u2014and you can't get more accessible than pencil and paper,\" said Li Yang, professor in the School of Artificial Intelligence at China's Hebei University of Technology. \"You don't need to have some piece of multi-million-dollar equipment for fabrication. You just need to be able to draw within the lines of a pre-drawn electrode on a treated piece of paper. It can be done simply and quickly.\"      The device takes advantage of the way paper naturally reacts to changes in humidity and uses the graphite in the pencil to interact with water molecules and the sodium chloride solution. As water molecules are absorbed by the paper, the solution becomes ionized and electrons begin to flow to the graphite in the pencil, setting off the sensor, which detects those changes in humidity in the environment and sends a signal to a smartphone, which displays and records the data.Essentially, drawing on the pre-treated paper within pre-treated lines creates a miniaturized paper circuit board. The paper can be connected to a computer with copper wires and conductive silver paste to act as an environmental humidity detector. For wireless application, such as \"smart diapers\" and mask-based respiration monitoring, the drawing is connected to a tiny lithium battery which powers data transmission to a smartphone via Bluetooth.For the respiration monitor, the team drew the electrode directly on a solution-treated face mask. The sensor easily differentiated mouth breathing from nose breathing and was able to classify three breathing states: deep, regular and rapid. Cheng explained that the data collected could be used to detect the onset of various disease conditions, such as respiratory arrest and shortness of breath and provide opportunities in the smart internet of things and telemedicine.

Credit: Huanyu \"Larry\" Cheng / Penn State             He added that respiratory rate is a fundamental vital sign and research has shown it to be an early indicator of a variety of pathological conditions such as cardiac events, pneumonia and clinical deterioration. It can also indicate emotional stressors like cognitive load, heat, cold, physical effort and exercise-induced fatigue.Compared with breath, the human skin exhibits a smaller change in humidity, but the researchers were still able to detect changes using their pencil-on-paper humidity sensor, even after test subjects applied lotion or exercised. Skin is the body's largest organ, Cheng explained, so if it is not processing moisture correctly, that could indicate that some other health issue is going on.\"Different types of disease conditions result in different rates of water loss on our skin,\" he said. \"The skin will function differently based on those underlying conditions, which we will be able to flag and possibly characterize using the sensor.\"The team also integrated four humidity sensors between the absorbent layers of a diaper to create a \"smart diaper,\" capable of detecting wetness and alerting for a change.\"That application was actually born out of personal experience,\" said Cheng, who is the father of two young children. \"There's no easy way to know how wet is wet, and that information could be really valuable for parents. The sensor can provide data in the short-term, to alert for diaper changes, but also in the long-term, to show patterns that can inform parents about the overall health of their child.\"The applications of the humidity sensor go beyond \"smart diapers\" and monitoring for respiration and perspiration, Cheng explained. The team also deployed the sensor as a noncontact switch, which could sense the humidity changes in the air from the presence of a finger without the finger touching the sensor. The team used the noncontact switch to operate a small-scale elevator, play a keyboard and light up an LED array.\"The atoms on the finger don't need to touch the button, they only need to be near the surface to diffuse the water molecules and trigger the signal,\" Cheng said. \"When we think about what we learned from the pandemic about the need to limit the body's contact with shared surfaces, a sensor like this could be an important tool to stop potential contamination.\" More information:Guangyu Niu et al, Pencil-on-Paper Humidity Sensor Treated with NaCl Solution for Health Monitoring and Skin Characterization, Nano Letters (2022).

  "text": "Researchers at Chalmers University of Technology and partners within the Chemical Imaging Infrastructure have produced a method whereby it is possible to see at the nano level where a medicinal drug ends up in the cells and how much of it is needed for optimum treatment. The technique enables the development of new pharmaceuticals and tailored treatments for diseases that have not previously been treatable.          \"Without needing to add anything to affect the cell, we can produce unique precision at the nano level. That is not possible with comparable methods that are currently in use,\" says Per Malmberg, Director of the infrastructure and senior researcher in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology.Thanks to the comprehensive knowledge of the human genome, researchers can design more effective drugs that work by engaging specific targets in the interior of the cell. This advance also makes it necessary for drug designers to consider how their molecules behave inside the cell.The new method, developed by the partners within the Chemical Imaging Infrastructure, is described in a recently released whitepaper. It involves enhanced cutting-edge technology and knowledge to analyze and quantify biological medicines, such as peptides and oligonucleotides, in human cells with considerable reliability.The new method is based on the NanoSIMS (nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry) instrument developed by CAMECA, which can measure and image molecules at high resolution on the nanoscale and has been available at the chemical imaging infrastructure since 2015. The instrument has been widely adopted by the scientific community for research, but it has not yet been applied to the development of medicinal drugs.\"Compared with similar techniques, the NanoSIMS methodology provides much faster and more accurate answers. With our technique, a drug project can receive an answer within about four weeks, and there are good opportunities to reduce the time even further,\" says Per Malmberg.Significance for unmet medical needsSo far, researchers have worked with cultured cells, but the technique can also be used to examine tissue. In the long term, it could also be used to investigate what happens in individual cells in an organ where the drug is expected to act. This could provide a key to a deeper understanding of, for example, neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS or Parkinson's disease, and cancer.The pharmaceutical industry has a significant need to develop and apply methodologies for nanoscale quantification of drug molecules and their distribution at the sub-cellular level.\"I am extremely pleased that we have succeeded in imaging medicinal drugs in cells. There are many things that can happen to a drug once it enters the cell. Now that we can make observations at this level for the first time, we can obtain critical information that will help us design drugs for diseases that have not previously been treatable,\" says Michael Kurczy, Associate Principal Scientist at AstraZeneca.Collaboration key to new resultsResearchers at Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg are responsible for the development, in collaboration with AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca's BioVentureHub and the company CAMECA. When the infrastructure partners' collective knowledge and expertise in terms of the preparation and measurement of samples were combined, results were achieved that would not have been possible without such collaboration.\"It is a great opportunity for researchers, especially young ones, to work at the interface of academia, industry and engineering. The synergy between the developers' direct insight into the industry's needs and problems, and the researchers' expertise and ideas on how they could be resolved, has been crucial in enabling us to present new, valuable tools, which will lead to a significant improvement in drug development processes and therefore the quality of people's lives,\" says Thi Ngoc Nhu Phan, Assistant Professor at the University of Gothenburg.

  "answer_squad": " prostate",
  "text": "Cedars-Sinai Cancer investigators have developed a new nanotechnology-based test that can detect and profile prostate cancers\u2014even in microscopic amounts. Their work, published in the journal Nano Today, suggests that this \"liquid biopsy\" test could spare many patients unnecessary treatment-related side effects, directing them instead to effective therapies that could prolong their lives.          \"This research will revolutionize the liquid biopsy in prostate cancer,\" said Edwin Posadas, MD, medical director of the Urologic Oncology Program and co-director of the Experimental Therapeutics Program in Cedars-Sinai Cancer. \"The test is fast, minimally invasive and cost-effective, and opens up a new suite of tools that will help us optimize treatment and quality of life for prostate cancer patients.\"Cancer of the prostate, a walnut-sized gland just below the bladder, is the most common cancer and second-leading cause of cancer death among U.S. men.The test developed by Posadas and co-investigators isolates and characterizes extracellular vesicles, also called EVs, from blood samples. EVs are microscopic packets of protein and genetic material that are shed by cells. The EV Digital Scoring Assay can pull these EV packets from the blood with unprecedented efficiency and analyze them in a manner that is faster than any currently available test.The investigators tested blood samples from 40 patients with prostate cancer and found that the test was able to distinguish cancer localized to the prostate from cancer that had spread to other parts of the body.Posadas envisions this test being used to help patients who have their prostate gland removed and later experience a rise in levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in their blood. This happens in about 30% of post-surgical patients, and elevated PSA levels can indicate cancer recurrence.If a remnant of the cancer has been left behind in the prostate bed, where the prostate gland once was, Posadas said focused radiation therapy can cure the disease or delay progression. But that treatment is not without risks.\"The bladder and rectum are near the prostate bed and can be damaged during the course of radiation therapy,\" Posadas said. \"The risk is only worth it if a man is going to benefit.\"If microscopic cancer deposits have spread outside the prostate area, focused radiation treatment will not prevent disease progression. These deposits, called micro-metastases, are not always detectable, even via the most advanced imaging, but investigators were able to detect them using the EV test.\"This would allow many patients to avoid the potential harms of radiation that isn't targeting their disease, and instead receive systemic therapy that could slow disease progression,\" Posadas said.In retrospective case studies, investigators tested blood samples taken over time from three prostate cancer patients, including one patient who had undergone focused radiation treatments.\"At the time he was being treated, I was concerned that he was not benefiting,\" Posadas said. \"And the test results mirrored his clinical behavior and showed that, indeed, the treatments were not effective because he had micro-metastatic disease.\"The test is the latest in a yearslong series of Cedars-Sinai Cancer breakthroughs involving EVs. Posadas said that it could also be adapted to guide treatment as prostate cancer therapies become more targeted at the molecular level, ultimately extending patients' lives. Posadas and his team of investigators are now working to further refine the test so that it can be studied in greater detail.\"This type of liquid biopsy, coupled with innovations such as our Molecular Twin initiative, is key to next-generation precision medicine that represents the newest frontier in cancer treatment,\" said Dan Theodorescu, MD, Ph.D., director of Cedars-Sinai Cancer and the PHASE ONE Distinguished Chair.\"And the type of progress we are making is only possible at an institution such as Cedars-Sinai Cancer, where we have patients, clinicians, scientists and creative engineering minds converging as one unit to address the most challenging problems in cancer.\"Posadas and the team aim to work with local and national partners and hope to see the test come into wide clinical practice in the near future.

  "answer_squad": " wire",
  "text": "Accelerated climate change is a major and acute threat to life on Earth. Rising temperatures are caused by microbes producing 50% of atmospheric methane which is 30 times more potent than CO2 at trapping heat. These elevated temperatures are also accelerating microbial growth and thus producing more greenhouse gases than can be used by plants. This weakens the Earth's ability to function as a carbon sink and further raises the global temperature.       A potential solution to this vicious circle could be another kind of microbe that eats up to 80% of methane flux from ocean sediments. But these organisms are difficult to study in the laboratory. In Nature Microbiology, a Yale team led by Prof. Nikhil Malvankar and former Ph.D. student Yangqi Gu discovered surprising, wire-like properties of a protein made by electricity-producing Geobacter that show similarity to those of methane-eating microbes.The Malvankar lab had previously reported that this protein wire shows the highest conductivity known to date, allowing bacteria to produce the most electric power reported so far, and explaining how these bacteria can survive without oxygen-like membrane-ingestible molecules. To date, no one had discovered how they are made or why they are so conductive.Using high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy, the researchers were able to see the nanowire's atomic structure. They discovered that hemes were packed closely to move electrons extremely quickly with great stability. The team also built some nanowires synthetically to explore how bacteria make nanowires on demand.\"It is possible we could use these wires to generate electricity or understand how methane-eating microbes use them to combat climate change,\" Malvankar said.

  "text": "That stubborn athlete's foot infection an estimated 70% of people get at some point in their life could become much easier to get rid of thanks to nanoscale drills activated by visible light.          Proven effective against antibiotic-resistant infectious bacteria and cancer cells, the molecular machines developed by Rice University chemist James Tour and collaborators are just as good at combating infectious fungi, according to a new study published in Advanced Science.Based on the work of Nobel laureate Bernard Feringa, the Tour group's molecular machines are nanoscale compounds whose paddlelike chain of atoms moves in a single direction when exposed to visible light. This causes a drilling motion that allows the machines to bore into the surface of cells, killing them.\"Dr. Tour posed the question of whether they can also kill fungi, which had never been explored before,\" said lead co-author Ana Santos, a Rice alumna who is currently a Marie Curie Global Postdoctoral Fellow at Fundaci\u00f3n Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria Islas Baleares in Spain. \"Our study is the first to show that, indeed, these molecules can also be effective against fungi.\"Fungal infections pose a particular threat to patients with a weakened immune system, such as cancer patients and transplant recipients. The cost of treating bacterial infections in the U.S. alone is estimated at more than $7 billion per year.COVID-19 has made matters worse. Immunosuppressants were widely used early in the pandemic to reduce the risk of long-term organ damage caused by an overactive immune system in response to the virus, a tactic that allowed fungal infections to proliferate.\"In the aftermath of that first wave of the pandemic, doctors started seeing an increase in cases of mucormycosis, or 'black fungus,' a normally rare fungal infection which causes a pneumonia-like illness, as a result of the overuse of immunosuppressant drugs,\" Santos said. \"We want to develop a way to combat fungal infections that does not tax a weakened immune system further, and we hope these molecular machines might be a way to do so.\"Santos said overuse of antifungals in agriculture is also contributing to resistance in humans.\"This is an emergent phenomenon that we are just starting to understand,\" she said. \"Antifungals are used in agriculture to combat damage to crops caused by fungal infestation. However, most of the antifungal drugs that are used in agriculture are also used in humans. Therefore, overuse of antifungals can lead to resistance not just in the fungi that cause plant illnesses but also in other fungi, including those that can be harmful to humans.\"In contrast to most antifungals, development of resistance to the visible-light activated nanoscale drills was not detected. Spinning at 2-3 million times per second, their rotors cause fungal cells to disintegrate by disrupting their metabolism.\"There are only a few classes of antifungals in clinical use,\" Santos said. \"These conventional antifungals typically employ one of a few different mechanisms of action, including inhibiting the synthesis of the fungal cell wall, targeting the fungal cell membrane or inhibiting the production of ergosterol, which is an essential component for normal fungal cell membrane structure.\"Our molecules differ from conventional antifungals in that they specifically target what we call the powerhouses of the cell, that is, the mitochondria,\" she continued. Mitochondria are responsible for producing adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, which drives cellular metabolism.\"By targeting the mitochondria, our molecules disrupt the cell's metabolism, resulting in an overall energy imbalance that leads to an uncontrolled flow of water and ions such as calcium into the cell, eventually causing the cell to explode,\" Santos explained.

  "text": "Mineral oil lubricants protect engine parts from wear, and this effect is enhanced by adding polymer nanoparticles to the lubricating oil. A UK team has now discovered that epoxy functionalization of these nanoparticles further promotes friction reduction on metal surfaces.          As the team reports in the journal Angewandte Chemie, nanoparticles containing epoxy groups adhere strongly to stainless steel surfaces, which leads to a significant reduction in friction.Automotive engines comprising well lubricated parts consume less fuel, produce lower emissions, and suffer less long-term wear. Mineral oil is widely used as a lubricant, and nanoparticles can be directly prepared within this solvent using a technique known as polymerization-induced self-assembly. Coating the surface of the metal components with nanoparticles of a few dozen millionths of a millimeter in size protects them from direct contact.Csilla Gy\u00f6rgy and Steve Armes at the University of Sheffield (UK) designed \"hairy\" nanoparticles comprising oil-soluble poly(lauryl methacrylate) chains and an oil-insoluble nanoparticulate core. These nanoparticles were made to stick strongly to metal surfaces by introducing epoxy groups into the \"hairs\" by copolymerizing lauryl methacrylate with glycidyl methacrylate, an epoxy-functional monomer.The team found that the epoxy-bearing nanoparticles reacted with hydroxy groups located at the surface of stainless steel. This reaction led to strong adhesion of the nanoparticles, a phenomenon known as chemical adsorption. Whether chemical adsorption occurred or not depended on the precise location of the epoxy groups. \"To our surprise, introducing a far larger number of epoxy groups into the nanoparticle cores had no beneficial effect,\" explains Armes.The adsorbed nanoparticles reduced friction significantly, as the Sheffield team discovered when conducting tribological studies in collaboration with scientists at Lubrizol, an engine oil additives company based in the UK. \"Remarkably, the adsorbed nanoparticles remained intact on the stainless steel surface after such experiments, which were conducted at the typical operating temperature of an internal combustion engine,\" Armes adds.Such epoxy-functionalized nanoparticles could therefore mean a further leap in performance for lubricant additives for next-generation engine oil formulations.

  "text": "A new antimicrobial suture material that glows in medical imaging could be a promising alternative for mesh implants and internal stitches.          Surgical site infections are one of the most common medical infections, occurring in 2 to 4% of patients post-surgery. For some procedures, such as vaginal mesh implants to treat prolapse, infection rates can be much higher, leading to a ban on that procedure in 2018 in Australia.Study lead author and Vice Chancellor's Senior Research Fellow, Dr. Shadi Houshyar, said their suture was being developed in partnership with clinicians specifically for this type of procedure.\"Our smart surgical sutures can play an important role in preventing infection and monitoring patient recovery and the proof-of-concept material we've developed has several important properties that make it an exciting candidate for this,\" said Houshyar, from RMIT University's School of Engineering.Lab tests on the surgical filament, published in OpenNano, showed it was easily visible in CT scans when threaded through samples of chicken meat, even after three weeks.It also showed strong antimicrobial properties, killing 99% of highly drug-resistant bacteria after six hours at body temperature.Houshyar said the team was not aware of any commercially available suture products that combined these properties.How they did itThe multidisciplinary team led by RMIT\u2014included nano-engineering, biomedical and textile experts working in partnership with a practicing surgeon\u2014used the university's cutting-edge textile manufacturing facility to develop their proof-of-concept material.The suture's properties come from the combination of iodine and tiny nanoparticles, called carbon dots, throughout the material.Carbon dots are inherently fluorescent, due to their particular wavelength, but they can also be tuned to various levels of luminosity that easily stand out from surrounding tissue in medical imaging.Attaching iodine to these carbon dots, meanwhile, provides them with their strong antimicrobial properties and greater X-ray visibility.Houshyar said carbon nano dots were safe, cheap and easy to produce in the lab from natural ingredients.

He said it addressed a real challenge faced by surgeons in trying to identify the precise anatomical location of internal meshes on CT scans.\"This mesh will enable us to help with improved identification of the causes of symptoms, reduce the incidence of mesh infections and will help with precise preoperative planning, if there is a need to surgically remove this mesh,\" he said.\"It has the potential to improve surgery outcomes and improve quality of life for a huge proportion of women, if used as vaginal mesh for example, by reducing the need for infected mesh removal.\"\"It may also significantly reduce surgery duration and increase surgical accuracy in general through the ability to visualize mesh location accurately on preoperative imaging.\"                A sample of the iodine-infused filament in the lab. Credit: RMIT University             Next stepsStudy co-author from RMIT's School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, Professor Elisa Hill-Yardin, said the next steps were pre-clinical trials.\"While this research is at an early stage, we believe we are onto something very promising that could help a lot of people and are really keen to speak with industry partners who are interested in working with us to take it further,\" she said.\"We see potential especially in vaginal mesh implants and similar procedures.\"The research team used Australia's leading university-based textile manufacturing facilities at RMIT's Centre for Materials Innovation and Future Fashion, as well as the Rapid Discovery and Fabrication team's labs to produce the proof-of-concept material.Next, they team plans to produce larger suture samples to use in pre-clinical trials.

  "text": "In a new study, scientists with the University of Florida have found that a combination of silver nanoparticles and antibiotics is effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.          The researchers hope to turn this discovery into viable treatment for some types of antibiotic-resistant infections. Antibiotic-resistant infections kill more than a million people globally each year.For centuries, silver has been known to have antimicrobial properties. However, silver nanoparticles\u2014microscopic spheres of silver small enough to operate at the cellular level\u2014represent a new frontier in using the precious metal to fight bacteria.In this study, the research team tested whether commercially available silver nanoparticles boost the power of antibiotics and enable these drugs to counter the very bacteria that have evolved to withstand them.\"We found that the silver nanoparticles and a common class of broad-spectrum antibiotics called aminoglycosides work together synergistically,\" said Daniel Czy\u017c, senior author of the study and an assistant professor in the UF/IFAS department of microbiology and cell science.\"When combined with a small amount of silver nanoparticles, the amount of antibiotic needed to inhibit the bacteria decreased 22-fold, which tells us that the nanoparticles make the drug much more potent,\" Czy\u017c explained. \"In addition, aminoglycosides can have negative side effects, so using silver nanoparticles could allow for a lower dose of antibiotic, reducing those side effects.\"The findings were both surprising and exciting, said Autumn Dove, first author of the study and a doctoral candidate studying microbiology and cell science in the UF/IFAS College of Agricultural and Life Sciences.\"When I first saw the result, my first thoughts were, 'Wow, this works,'\" said Dove.Over the last several decades, overuse of antibiotics had led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and a decline in the effectiveness of traditional antibiotic drugs, the researchers said. The study's findings indicate that silver nanoparticles have the potential to renew the effectiveness of some of these drugs.\"Let's say you get a bad burn on your hand, and it gets infected with one of these resistant strains of bacteria,\" Dove said. \"It's possible that dressing that burn with a combination of silver nanoparticles and antibiotics could both clear that infection and prevent those resistant bacteria from spreading elsewhere.\"Though antibiotics mainly target bacteria, they can also damage human and animal cells. Using a microscopic worm called C. elegans, the researchers confirmed that the silver nanoparticles did not also make the antibiotic more toxic to non-bacterial cells.Building on the study's promising findings, the scientists next plan to seek FDA authorization for clinical trials and work with UF Innovate to patent an antimicrobial product that uses silver nanoparticles.

  "answer_squad": " NaDeNo",
  "text": "Peritoneal cancer is difficult to treat and has a poor survival prognosis. But a new and effective nanomedicine delivery system is offering some hope.          The company is called NaDeNo and is well underway with the development of a new cure for cancers that have spread to the peritoneal cavity. It is a spin-off from SINTEF, where the technology was developed over a period of more than ten years within nanomedicine research.The work from which NaDeNo has evolved started in 2012. Initial research at SINTEF yielded promising results, and now both the technology and its patents are being spun off from the research institute and into a separate company.The technology makes it possible to embed large volumes of an active cancer drug in nanoparticle carriers. These carriers are then injected into the peritoneal cavity, enabling the drug to be evenly distributed and thus delivered to all the tumors developed in the peritoneum.Delivering a large dose the tumorsExperiments using mice and rats demonstrate that the nanoparticles accumulate preferentially in the tumors, thus releasing a much greater proportion of the drug to cancer cells than they do to healthy cells.\"A solid foundation created by research carried out at SINTEF has enabled progress within the development of this technology,\" says \u00ddrr M\u00f8rch, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and co-founder at NaDeNo. \"If we get the results we're hoping for, the technology may represent a significant step forward, not only for the future treatment of peritoneal cancer, but also for other illnesses,\" he says.However, in order to make the technology accessible to cancer patients, it first has to be tested thoroughly and then manufactured at larger scales. It must be both safe and effective.\"We're now getting ready to start pre-clinical trials,\" says M\u00f8rch. \"This phase will take some years, during which we will carry out a number of animal studies using standardized methods. We have to test the product thoroughly and also demonstrate that the drug is safe and can be manufactured with appropriate medical purity,\" he says.The company will then apply to carry out clinical trials on cancer patients.\"Nanoparticles are now being manufactured at laboratory scale at SINTEF, but we have to show that we can produce these at an industrial scale,\" says M\u00f8rch. \"This must be carried out by specialist manufacturers, but to do this we have to go overseas,\" he says. \"A lot of research remains to be completed before the technology can be applied on cancer patients. We are still at an early phase,\" he says.      Difficult-to-treat peritoneal cancerPeritoneal cancer is difficult to discover and to treat. It often arises as a result of the spread of cancer cells from other organs such as the ovaries or digestive tract. It gives few symptoms and is often discovered too late. Survival prognoses are usually poor.Current treatment approaches are yet to be standardized, and they tend to be life-extending rather than curative.Patients who gets this diagnosis are commonly treated by surgical removal of all visible cancer tissue followed by chemotherapy that is administered either locally, or to the entire body via the blood. The problem with this approach is that the drug either has too short residence time in the peritoneal cavity, or fails to reach the cavity and the cancer cells.\"This is due to a barrier that exists between the blood and the peritoneum,\" says Annbj\u00f8rg Falck, who is CEO and co-founder of NaDeNo.In order for the drug to work effectively it has to be soluble in water. However, many chemotherapeutic treatments involve small-molecule drugs that are poorly soluble in water. Such treatments are thus difficult to deliver targeted at tumor sites.Small particles with an enormous surface areaNaDeNo is aiming to address this by encapsulating the drug in tiny nanoparticle carriers. The nanoparticles are injected directly into the peritoneal cavity in a solution that ensures that they are distributed uniformly and reach all the tumors in the peritoneum. They then release the drug at the tumor sites.\"This drug is poorly soluble in water when it is 'naked' but becomes highly soluble when embedded in the nanocapsules developed by SINTEF,\" says M\u00f8rch. \"The capsules help the drug to reach the correct location. When the particles degrade in the body the drug is released,\" she says.In experiments with mice and rats, the researchers have observed that the nanoparticles accumulate in the tumors located in the peritoneum. This enables a greater proportion of the drug to reach the cancer cells and less is wasted on the healthy cells.\"The uniform distribution of the drug throughout the peritoneal cavity, combined with the longer residence time, demonstrates that the animals appear to tolerate the drug better when this delivery system is used,\" says M\u00f8rch.There are also other benefits.\"The size of the nanoparticles means that they have a large surface area in relation to their volume,\" he says. \"As many as 10\u00b9\u00b2 particles are contained in every milliliter of solution\u2014literally billions of particles. This makes an enormous surface area available for interaction between the particles and their surroundings, and not least for attachment to the various cells and tissues in the human body,\" says M\u00f8rch.This enables the nanoparticles to deliver large amounts of the drug to the tumors.                Diagram showing the anti-cancer cytotoxin cabazitaxel (in red) encapsulated in nanoparticle carriers. The material used to make the capsule (in green) is a degradable synthetic polymer. The same material is used to close wounds, since it will gradually degrad in the body. Credit: SINTEF/NaDeNo             An effective anti-cancer cytotoxinThe product currently being developed by NaDeNo can thus be described as a nanotechnological platform for the encapsulation of non-water soluble (hydrophobic) drugs in nanoparticle carriers. There is currently great demand for the effective delivery of such drugs.\"If we succeed with our first product, it will enable us to offer a delivery technology that can benefit companies in both the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors,\" says M\u00f8rch.The cytotoxin that the company is using is called cabazitaxel. It is very effective, but current methods of delivery also cause major side effects.\"Cabazitaxel is currently used only for the treatment of prostate cancer,\" says Annbj\u00f8rg Falck. \"The active component is highly toxic and is poorly soluble in water. For this reason, there are limits on how much of the drug can be administered without causing serious side effects,\" she says.The poor water solubility of cabazitaxel makes it difficult to develop nanoparticle delivery systems for the drug. NaDeNo thus has to demonstrate that embedding the drug in nanoparticles offers better efficacy compared to current treatments for patients suffering from cancer metastasis to the peritoneal cavity.\"Cabazitaxel is very powerful and exhibits less resistance development than other comparable cytotoxins,\" says Falck. \"A new and optimized delivery method will thus enable many more patients to benefit from this effective drug,\" she says.Multiple applicationsUp until now, SINTEF's development of its nanoparticle technology has been carried out in close collaboration with the Norwegian Radium Hospital in Oslo, with expertise in peritoneal cancer treatments.This collaboration has provided NaDeNo's first development candidate with a key clinical foundation and has enabled the company to obtain access to representative mouse models of human cancers, with very promising results.\"The Radium Hospital treats patients suffering from metastasis to the peritoneal cavity according to high international standards,\" says M\u00f8rch. \"The method is called hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), where all visible tumor tissue is surgically removed from the cavity prior to local treatment with heated chemotherapy. In some cases, better efficacy is achieved by this methode. However, the treatment is very strenuous for the patients, who are very ill. The cytotoxin has a short residence time in the peritoneum and distributes rapidly to other parts of the body.Kjersti Flatmark is a Professor and Senior Consultant in gastrosurgery at the Norwegian Radium Hospital and speaks very positively about the collaboration with NaDeNo and SINTEF.\"Metastasis to the peritoneum is difficult to treat and comes with a very poor prognosis. Unfortunately, our current treatment approaches very rarely cure our patients, so it is clearly a need for better treatment options. It has been exciting to be part of this collaborative effort, firstly with SINTEF and now with NaDeNo. Up to now we have focused on the development and testing of the technology in model systems, and are hoping that in the long term, the delivery of cytotoxins in nanoparticle carriers will contribute towards better treatment efficacy, enabling many more patients to enjoy a full recovery,\" she says.Initially, NaDeNo is focusing on a group comprising 37,000 patients annually in Europe and the U.S. The company also has ambitions to apply the technology to a greater number of patients.\"If the first drug delivery system works, this will be a good indication that we have a technology that can be used for the treatment of many types of cancer that are currently difficult to treat,\" says M\u00f8rch.In August 2022, NaDeNo's first development candidate was accepted by the NCI as a promising nanomedicine. The NCI carries out a standardized preclinical test program free of charge, where the aim is to accelerate the development of nanomedicines that have the potential to treat patients with life-threatening diseases for which there is currently a pressing medical demand to find a cure.\"Inclusion in one of the NCI's preclinical test programs is a key milestone for us, and offers valuable recognition of our development program,\" says Annbj\u00f8rg Falck. The criteria for inclusion are quite strict, so this demonstrates that the work carried out by SINTEF over many years is of a high international standard,\" she says.Heidi Johnsen is a research manager for the team at SINTEF that participated in the development of the NaDeNo technology platform, and is optimistic for the future of the spin-off company.\"At SINTEF we work towards developing technology for a better society and I am proud of what we have achieved so far. We will continue to do the best we can in terms of effective collaboration to ensure that NaDeNo is successful with its product development,\" she says.\"Our current strategy is to secure sound future investment with the aim of bringing our first product to the market and to patients, while at the same time continuing to develop our technological platform,\" says Falck. \"In this connection, we also want to forge links with partners in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors that are looking for new and better ways of delivering poorly water-soluble drugs,\" she concludes.

  "text": "A new way to significantly increase the potency of almost any vaccine has been developed by researchers from the International Institute for Nanotechnology (IIN) at Northwestern University. The scientists used chemistry and nanotechnology to change the structural location of adjuvants and antigens on and within a nanoscale vaccine, greatly increasing vaccine performance. The antigen targets the immune system, and the adjuvant is a stimulator that increases the effectiveness of the antigen.          The study was published Jan. 30 in Nature Biomedical Engineering.\"The work shows that vaccine structure and not just the components is a critical factor in determining vaccine efficacy,\" said lead investigator Chad A. Mirkin, director of the IIN. \"Where and how we position the antigens and adjuvant within a single architecture markedly changes how the immune system recognizes and processes it.Mirkin also is the George B. Rathmann Professor of Chemistry at the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and a professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.This new heightened emphasis on structure has the potential to improve the effectiveness of conventional cancer vaccines, which historically have not worked well, Mirkin said.Mirkin's team has studied the effect of vaccine structure in the context of seven different types of cancer to date, including triple-negative breast cancer, papillomavirus-induced cervical cancer, melanoma, colon cancer and prostate cancer to determine the most effective architecture to treat each disease.Conventional vaccines take a blender approach With most conventional vaccines, the antigen and the adjuvant are blended and injected into a patient. There is no control over the vaccine structure, and, consequently, limited control over the trafficking and processing of the vaccine components. Thus, there is no control over how well the vaccine works.\"A challenge with conventional vaccines is that out of that blended mish mosh, an immune cell might pick up 50 antigens and one adjuvant or one antigen and 50 adjuvants,\" said study author and former Northwestern postdoctoral associate Michelle Teplensky, who is now an assistant professor at Boston University. \"But there must be an optimum ratio of each that would maximize the vaccine's effectiveness.\"Enter SNAs (spherical nucleic acids), which are the structural platform\u2014invented and developed by Mirkin\u2014used in this new class of modular vaccines. SNAs allow scientists to pinpoint exactly how many antigens and adjuvants are being delivered to cells. SNAs also enable scientists to tailor how these vaccine components are presented, and the rate at which they are processed. Such structural considerations, which greatly impact vaccine effectiveness, are largely ignored in conventional approaches.      Vaccines developed through 'rational vaccinology' offer precise dosing for maximum effectivenessThis approach to systematically control antigen and adjuvant locations within modular vaccine architectures was created by Mirkin, who coined the term rational vaccinology to describe it. It is based on the concept that the structural presentation of vaccine components is as important as the components themselves in driving efficacy.\"Vaccines developed through rational vaccinology deliver the precise dose of antigen and adjuvant to every immune cell, so they are all equally primed to attack cancer cells,\" said Mirkin, who also is a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. \"If your immune cells are soldiers, a traditional vaccine leaves some unarmed; our vaccine arms them all with a powerful weapon with which to kill cancer. Which immune cell 'soldiers' do you want to attack your cancer cells?\" Mirkin asked rhetorically.Building an (even) better vaccineThe team developed a cancer vaccine that doubled the number of cancer antigen-specific T cells and increased the activation of these cells by 30% by reconfiguring the architecture of the vaccine to contain multiple targets to help the immune system find tumor cells.The team investigated differences in how well two antigens were recognized by the immune system depending on their placement\u2014on the core or perimeter\u2014of the SNA structure. For an SNA with optimum placement, they could increase the immune response and how quickly the nanovaccine triggered cytokine (an immune cell protein) production to boost T cells attacking the cancer cells. The scientists also studied how the different placements affected the immune system's ability to remember the invader, and whether the memory was long-term.\"Where and how we position the antigens and adjuvant within a single architecture markedly changes how the immune system recognizes and processes it,\" Mirkin said.The most powerful structure throws two punches to outsmart the wily, mutating tumorThe study data show that attaching two different antigens to an SNA comprising a shell of adjuvant was the most potent approach for a cancer vaccine structure. It led to a 30% increase in antigen-specific T-cell activation and doubled the number of proliferating T cells compared to a structure in which the same two antigens were attached to two separate SNAs.These engineered SNA nanostructures stalled tumor growth in multiple animal models.\"It is remarkable,\" Mirkin said. \"When altering the placement of antigens in two vaccines that are nearly identical from a compositional standpoint, the treatment benefit against tumors is dramatically changed. One vaccine is potent and useful, while the other is much less effective.\"Many current cancer vaccines are designed to primarily activate cytotoxic T cells, only one defense against a cancer cell. Because tumor cells are always mutating, they can easily escape this immune cell surveillance, quickly rendering the vaccine ineffective. The odds are higher that the T cell will recognize a mutating cancer cell if it has more ways\u2014multiple antigens\u2014to recognize it.\"You need more than one type of T cell activated, so you can more easily attack a tumor cell,\" Teplensky said. \"The more types of cells the immune system has to go after tumors, the better. Vaccines consisting of multiple antigens targeting multiple immune cell types are necessary to induce enhanced and long-lasting tumor remission.\"Another advantage of the rational vaccinology approach, especially when used with a nanostructure like an SNA, is that it's easy to alter the structure of a vaccine to go after a different type of disease. Mirkin said they simply switch out a peptide, a snippet of a cancer protein with a chemical handle that \"clips\" onto the structure, not unlike adding a new charm to a bracelet.Path to most effective vaccine for any cancer type\"The collective importance of this work is that it lays the foundation for developing the most effective forms of vaccine for almost any type of cancer,\" Teplensky said. \"It is about redefining how we develop vaccines across the board, including ones for infectious diseases.\"In a previously published paper, Mirkin, Teplensky and colleagues demonstrated the importance of vaccine structure for COVID-19 by creating vaccines that exhibited protective immunity in 100% of animals against a lethal viral infection.\"Small changes in antigen placement on a vaccine significantly elevate cell-to-cell communication, cross-talk and cell synergy,\" Mirkin said. \"The developments made in this work provide a path forward to rethinking the design of vaccines for cancer and other diseases as a whole.\"Northwestern Ph.D. candidate Michael Evangelopoulos also is an author of the paper, titled \"Multi-Antigen Spherical Nucleic Acid Cancer Vaccines.\" More information:Chad Mirkin, Multi-antigen spherical nucleic acid cancer vaccines, Nature Biomedical Engineering (2023).

A research team led by a scholar from City University of Hong Kong (CityU) recently developed a novel, tiny device to hold liquid specimens for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation, opening the door to directly visualizing and recording complex electrochemical reactions at nanoscale in real-time at high resolution.The research team believes that this innovative method will shed light on strategies for fabricating a powerful research tool for uncovering the mysteries of electrochemical processes in the future.The use of conventional TEM is limited to thin, stable and solid samples because of the vacuum environment (a vacuum environment prevents the electrons from being absorbed or deflected along their pathways and affecting observation) in the chamber for holding the specimens. Liquid specimens are vacuum-incompatible, so they cannot be directly probed in traditional TEM.Fabrication process of the electrochemical liquid cell. Credit: Nature Protocols (2022). DOI: 10.1038/s41596-022-00762-yFortunately, with the emergence of the more advanced in-situ \"liquid cell TEM,\" it is possible to study liquid phase dynamic processes in situ, such as observing crystal nucleation and growth in solution, electrochemical reactions in energy devices, and the life activities of living cells.The \"liquid cell\" is a core component of TEM to hold the specimens for the electron beam to pass through, thus enabling in-situ observation. But it is challenging to manufacture a high-quality liquid cell for TEM because it involves incorporating electrodes and encapsulating electrolytes in a tiny \"closed\" liquid cell to prevent leakage and connect it to an external power source at the same time.A research team co-led by Dr. Zeng Zhiyuan, Assistant Professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at CityU, and Professor Li Ju from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) successfully developed an efficient and novel method to fabricate \"closed\" electrochemical liquid cells, which can greatly improve the resolution of TEM with liquid samples.      \"The newly developed closed liquid cell performs two main jobs: (1) enclosing the liquid samples in a closed container, thereby separating them from the microscope vacuum environment; and (2) confining the liquid samples to a thin enough liquid layer using two electron-transparent silicon nitride (SiNx) windows, so that electrons can travel through the liquid layer and image the reactions,\" explained Dr. Zeng.In situ TEM observation of electrochemical processes and post-in situ characterizations. Credit: Nature Protocols (2022). DOI: 10.1038/s41596-022-00762-yTo manufacture the high-performance, \"closed\" electrochemical liquid cells in this protocol, the research team used advanced nanofabrication techniques, including photolithography, to fabricate the core component of in situ liquid TEM\u2014the liquid cell. Photolithography is a process that uses ultraviolet light to transfer a geometric design from an optical mask to a light-sensitive chemical (photoresist) coated on the substrate.The team fabricated the bottom chip and top chip separately, and then assembled them together. Gold or titanium electrodes were deposited on the bottom chip during the metal deposition process. Then the electrolyte was loaded and sealed inside the liquid cell.Using this innovative liquid cell with the transmission electron microscope, the dynamic electrochemical reactions of the liquid sample on the electrode surface can be recorded in real time at high resolution through the TEM operating system incorporated with a high spatio-temporal resolution camera.\"The electrochemical liquid cell designed by our customized nanofabrication method has thinner SiNx imaging windows (35nm) than commercial ones (50nm),\" explained Dr. Zeng. \"It also has a thinner liquid layer (150nm) than that of commercial ones (1,000 nm). The thinner SiNx imaging windows and thinner liquid layer ensure that our fabricated liquid cell can capture electrochemical reactions with better TEM spatial resolution than commercial ones can.\"The team believes that a lot of opportunities and applications for the in-situ TEM observation of electrochemical reactions will emerge soon after the development of the electrochemical liquid cell with the selection of patterned metal electrodes and the encapsulated liquid electrolytes in the liquid cell.This newly proposed fabrication protocol can also be utilized in other in-situ techniques beyond TEM. For example, a proper adjustment to this protocol would be suitable for the fabrication of electrochemical liquid cells for in-situ X-ray characterizations of electrochemical reactions (X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, etc.).The findings were published in Nature Protocols.

  "text": "In the year 1808, French chemists Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis-Jacques Thenard, and independently, English chemist Humphry Davy, discovered the fifth element of the periodic table\u2014boron. In crystalline form, boron primarily possesses three polymorphs, i.e., three distinct unit cell configurations: \u03b1-rhombohedral, \u03b2-rhombohedral, and \u03b2-tetragonal, among 16 possible bulk allotropes.       The unique properties of this element have resulted in its use in numerous applications, including chemistry, materials science, life sciences, energy research and electronics. Moreover, based on studies conducted over the past decade, boron has significant potential for use in pharmaceutical drug design as it plays an essential role in bone growth and maintenance, wound healing, prevention of vitamin-D deficiency and other processes.In the periodic table of elements, boron lies to the left of carbon, which causes boron to have similar valence orbitals but a shorter covalent radius. In contrast to carbon, which favors a 2D (two-dimensional) layered structure (aka graphite) in its bulk form, the bulk allotropes of boron are composed of B12 icosahedral cages. As a result, it was challenging to experimentally realize a 2D atomic network of boron, also known as borophene, until 2015.                Figure 1: The structure of Boron allotropes: bulk polymorphs of (a) \u03b1-rhombohedral Boron, (b) \u03b2- rhombohedral Boron, and (c) \u03b2-tetragonal Boron. Credit: Advanced Functional Materials (2016).  DOI: 10.1002/adfm.201603300             Initially, one of the underlying reasons for limited experimental investigations of 2D boron sheets was the use of costly and toxic precursors, e.g., diborane. Later, atomically thin borophene sheets were grown under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions using a solid boron atomic source of 99.9999% purity to circumvent the difficulties caused by poisonous precursors.Recently, borophene has drawn tremendous attention for its ultralow molar mass. Unlike graphene, borophene comes with different polymorphs, such as striped, \u03b212, X3, and honeycomb, and until now, all of them turned out to be metallic. However, bulk boron is semiconducting. Naturally, researchers want to explore the semiconducting 2D phase of boron.                Figure 2: Structure and band dispersion of clustered-P1 borophene. (a) Top and (b, c) side views of CP1 borophene. (d) Electronic band dispersion. Credit: ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces (2023). DOI: 10.1021/acsami.2c20055             Semiconductors play a crucial role in the design of transistors and integrated circuits built with them. The use of silicon as a base semiconducting material in a transistor has revolutionized the electronics industry. With time, downscaling of transistor size has enabled engineers to pack millions of transistors in a unit area of silicon wafer.      However, researchers predict that the downscaling of silicon technology will reach its bottleneck within the next few years. Therefore, the semiconductor industry needs to explore 2D materials as an alternative to silicon, as researchers declare that 2D materials may provide optimum electrostatic integrity for transistors.After the discovery of graphene in 2004, a dozen 2D semiconductors (e.g., germanane, tellurene, phosphorene, etc.) have been investigated experimentally for transistor channel application. However, exploring 2D materials experimentally from their infinite space is unfeasible. Therefore, with the advancement in computational science and technology, the discovery of the relevant transistor material from the enormous 2D material space is in demand.So far, the reported semiconducting phases of borophene exhibit small bandgaps, which make them inappropriate as transistor channel material. In our work, we have discovered a hyper-coordinated 2D network of boron atoms named clustered-P1 borophene. It shows a bulk silicon-like band gap, yet lower and symmetric effective masses along the transport direction.                Figure 3: Device schematic and transfer characteristics.

DOI: 10.1021/acsami.2c20055             In our recent work, which is published in ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces (\"Discovery of Clustered-P1 borophene and Its Application as the Lightest High-Performance Transistor\"), we begin the study with a first-principles-based search of boron's 2D space, employing an evolutionary algorithm. It yields the exceptional semiconducting borophene phase, clustered-p1 borophene, that exhibits a total energy close to the global minimum of all borophene phases.After that, we have predicted the performance characteristics of conventional MOSFETs (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors) implemented with clustered-P1 borophene for 10-nm to 3-nm channel lengths. We have performed this work using an in-house, GPU-based, self-consistent quantum transport simulator. The performance of these MOSFETs has been found to meet the IRDS (international roadmap for devices and systems) requirements for several benchmark metrics.

DOI: 10.1021/acsami.2c20055             The clustered-p1 borophene shows remarkable thermodynamic, structural, and dynamic stability. As shown in our work, it is noteworthy that even a transistor of 3-nm channel length can deliver 104 ON-to-OFF current ratio. On the other hand, the balanced-mode operation of n- and p-type MOSFETs makes it suitable for CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) circuit performance. Keeping these beneficial outcomes in mind, we have predicted that the clustered-P1 borophene MOSFET may lead to a good option for possibly the lightest high-performance transistor.This story is part of Science X Dialog, where researchers can report findings from their published research articles.

  "text": "Researchers at Drexel University are one step closer to making wearable textile technology a reality. Recently published in the Journal of Materials Chemistry A, materials scientists from Drexel's College of Engineering, in partnership with a team at Accenture Labs, have reported a new design of a flexible wearable supercapacitor patch. It uses MXene, a material discovered at Drexel University in 2011, to create a textile-based supercapacitor that can charge in minutes and power an Arduino microcontroller temperature sensor and radio communication of data for almost two hours.          \"This is a significant development for wearable technology,\" said Yury Gogotsi, Ph.D., Distinguished University and Bach professor in Drexel's College of Engineering, who co-authored the study. \"To fully integrate technology into fabric, we must also be able to seamlessly integrate its power source\u2014our invention shows the path forward for textile energy storage devices.\"Co-authored along with Gogotsi's undergraduate and postdoctoral students, Genevieve Dion, professor and director of the Center for Functional Fabrics, and researchers from Accenture Labs in California, the study builds on previous research that looked at durability, electric conductivity and energy storage capacity of MXene-functionalized textiles that did not push to optimize the textile for powering electronics beyond passive devices such as LED lights. The latest work shows that not only can it withstand the rigors of being a textile, but it can also store and deliver enough power to run programmable electronics collecting and transmitting environmental data for hours\u2014progress that could position it for use in health care technology.Researchers at Drexel University have developed a textile supercapacitor that can power a microcontroller and wirelessly transmit temperature data for nearly two hours without a recharge. Credit: Drexel University\"While there are many materials out there that can be integrated into textiles, MXene has a distinct advantage over other materials because of its natural conductivity and ability to disperse in water as a stable colloidal solution. This means textiles can easily be coated with MXene without using chemical additives\u2014and additional production steps\u2014to get the MXene to adhere to the fabric,\" said Tetiana Hryhorchuk, a doctoral researcher in Drexel's College of Engineering and co-author. \"As a result, our supercapacitor showed a high energy density and enabled functional applications such as powering programmable electronics, which is needed for implementing textile-based energy storage into the real-life applications.\"Drexel researchers have been exploring the possibility of adapting MXene, a conductive two-dimensional nanomaterial, as a coating that can imbue a wide range of materials with exceptional properties of conductivity, durability, impermeability to electromagnetic radiation, and energy storage.      Recently, the team has looked at ways of using conductive MXene yarn to create textiles that sense and respond to temperature, movement and pressure. But to fully integrate these fabric devices as \"wearables\" the researchers also needed to find a way to weave a power source into the mix.\"Flexible, stretchable and truly textile-grade energy storing platforms have so far remained missing from most e-textile systems due to the insufficient performance metrics of current available materials and technologies,\" the research team wrote. \"Previous studies reported sufficient mechanical strength to withstand industrial knitting. However, the demonstrated application only included simple devices.\"The team set out to design its MXene textile supercapacitor patch with the goal of maximizing energy storage capacity while using a minimal amount of active material and taking up the smallest amount of space\u2014to reduce the overall cost of production and preserve flexibility and wearability of the garment.To create the supercapacitor, the team simply dipped small swatches of woven cotton textile into a MXene solution and then layered on a lithium chloride electrolyte gel. Each supercapacitor cell consists of two layers of MXene-coated textile with an electrolyte separator also made of cotton textile. To make a patch with enough power to run some useful devices\u2014Arduino programmable microcontrollers, in this case\u2014the team stacked five cells to create a power pack capable of charging to 6 volts, the same amount as the larger rectangular batteries often used to power golf carts, electric lanterns, or for jump-starting vehicles.\"We came to the optimized configuration of a dip-coated, five-cell stack with an area of 25 square centimeters to produce the electrical loading necessary to power programmable devices,\" said Alex Inman, a doctoral researcher in the College of Engineering, and co-author of the paper. \"We also vacuum-sealed the cells to prevent degradation in performance. This packaging approach could be applicable to commercial products.\"The best-performing textile supercapacitor powered an Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V microcontroller that was able to wirelessly transmit temperature every 30 seconds for 96 minutes. It maintained this level of performance consistently for more than 20 days.\"The initial report of a MXene textile supercapacitor powering a practical peripheral electronics system demonstrates the potential of this family of two-dimensional materials to support a wide range of devices such as motion trackers and biomedical monitors in a flexible textile form,\" Gogotsi said.The research team notes that this is one of the highest total power outputs on record for a textile energy device, but it can still improve. As they continue to develop the technology, they will test different electrolytes and textile electrode configurations to boost voltage, as well as designing it in a variety of wearable forms.\"Power for existing e-textile devices still largely relies on traditional form factors like lithium-polymer and coin cell lithium batteries,\" the researchers wrote. \"As such, most e-textile systems do not use a flexible e-textile architecture that includes flexible energy storage. The MXene supercapacitor developed in this study fills the void, providing a textile-based energy storage solution that can power flexible electronics.\" More information:Alex Inman et al, Wearable energy storage with MXene textile supercapacitors for real world use, Journal of Materials Chemistry A (2023).

  "text": "Carbon-based catalysts have garnered extensive attention over the past decades as an economical alternative to noble metal catalysts for renewable energy systems.          A recent study, affiliated with UNIST, has unveiled the theoretical principle that carbon-based catalysts promote electrochemical reactions. The key to this is that the presence of carbon defects\u2014along with the structural flexibility and chemical reactions\u2014are combined to enable the improvement of catalytic activity even without the need of precious metal catalysts, such as platinum (Pt).The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an important electrochemical reaction and has been widely applied in renewable energy applications, such as hydrogen fuel cells, water splitting, and metal\u2013air batteries (MABs). Currently, commercial Pt-based catalysts (PBCs) are used extensively for this purpose due to their superior catalytic activity. However, the high price, facile CO poisoning, and low durability of Pt hamper the large-scale applications of PBCs, and thus noted the research team.Carbon-based catalysts are being actively studied as a leading alternative material, and the efficiency and composition of catalysts are being steadily improved. However, the cause of carbon-based catalysts promoting electrochemical reactions is not clear, slowing the development of carbon-based catalysts.In this study, the research team demonstrated how two kinds of defects\u2014carbon vacancies and pyridinic-N dopants, in metal-free carbon materials\u2014enhance O2 adsorption, a critical reaction step for activating the ORR.\"Our calculations and structural analysis revealed that defects enable the neighboring edge carbon sites to adsorb O2 by enhancing the structural flexibility and, thus, lowering the energy barrier for the sp2/sp3 transition of the carbon atom,\" noted the research team. \"Thus, the nonlocal structural environment is as critical as the direct interaction between the adsorption site and adsorbate in the chemical reaction.\"Their findings further show that pyridinic-N has advantages over carbon vacancies in terms of structural stability. \"Our study is based on numerous theoretical and experimental investigations of carbon materials and is consistent with catalytic experimental results,\" added the research team. \"Moreover, our results can be extended to general chemical reactions in defective carbon materials and will spur research in defect engineering.\"Their findings have been published in ACS Nano.More information:Keunsu Choi et al, Theoretical Study of Oxygen Reduction Reaction Mechanism in Metal-Free Carbon Materials: Defects, Structural Flexibility, and Chemical Reaction, ACS Nano (2022).

  "answer_squad": " electrospinning",
  "text": "Engineers have employed \"electrospinning,\" a new technique of manufacturing nanomaterials, to produce a novel fabric that offers high performance protection against electromagnetic interference, a phenomenon that can result in electronic device malfunction and at high levels of exposure can harm human health.          The technique is described in a paper published in Nano Research on December 31, 2022.Electric and magnetic fields generated by electrical equipment can negatively interfere with digital systems either internally or externally. Such disruption can result in dangerous malfunctions if such devices are operating close to each other, particularly in the case of transportation or medical equipment such as pacemakers and insulin pumps. This interference can not only affect electronic devices, but at very high levels over short periods, it can also put at risk human biology, which in part makes use of bioelectromagnetic processes.For all these reasons, a great deal of effort goes into shielding people, devices and parts of devices from electromagnetic interference. To avoid making devices\u2014particularly wearable ones\u2014overly bulky and heavy, such shielding also needs to be lightweight and flexible.Since the 1960s, such shielding has focused on the use of metal wire fabrics, metal wire blended with chemical fibers, and silver plating. The high cost and poor flexibility, however, were major barriers to widespread acceptance of such electromagnetic protective fabrics.More recently, and largely thanks to the electromagnetic shielding needs of military stealth technologies, novel carbon-based materials from graphene to carbon aerogels and carbon nanotubes have been applied with great success in various electromagnetic absorption and shielding applications. Thanks to the special structures of these materials, at the microscopic scale and the nanoscale, that mainly rely on scattering and reflection of radiation between layers, as well as electron transfer, to achieve high attenuation of electromagnetic waves. They also benefit from their high electrical conductivity and surface area, light weight, flexibility, and environmental sustainability.      Special mesh structure composites, constructed by combining so-called one-dimensional materials (exceptionally thin ribbons or wires between 1 and 100 nanometers in length and effectively no width) with two-dimensional materials (similarly thin materials but existing in planar form, like an extremely thin piece of paper), have particularly excellent electromagnetic wave absorption and shielding properties.\"But even here, integrating multiple functions such as electromagnetic wave protection, durability, and comfort while maintaining the inherent flexibility of fabrics has remained a formidable challenge,\" said Shuo Zhang, lead author of the paper and researcher with the State Key Laboratory of Biofibers and Eco-textiles, College of Materials Science and Engineering at Qingdao University.However, in recent years a series of two-dimensional layered structures made from carbides (any compound of carbon and a metal) and nitrides (any inorganic compound of nitrogen) have begun to attract attention amongst electromagnetic shielding researchers. These 2D materials are called MXenes, as they are produced from \"MAX\" substances, where the M stands for an early transition metal such as titanium, vanadium and chromium; the A stands for any of the Group A elements in the periodic table such as aluminum, silicon and tin; and the X stands for carbon or nitrogen. The \"ene\" suffix is there to suggest a nano-structural similarity to graphene.Typically these MXenes have been produced via a process of etching them by immersing a MAX substance in hydrofluoric acid. Their 2D layered structure offers many options for internal reflection, as well as offering superior electron transfer efficiency, high surface area, and mechanical properties, all of which deliver excellent absorption of electromagnetic waves.The best performing MXene so far has achieved a \"reflection loss\" performance of -41.8 decibels at 1.1 milimeters.The researchers thought they could outdo this by exploring methods of manufacture other than etching, and looked to electrospinning. This is a technique of manufacturing extremely narrow, nanoscale fibers. A solution containing the desired material is held in a syringe tipped with a needle and then a high-voltage power source allows electric charge to gather on the surface of the liquid. At a certain point, the electrostatic repulsion between charges exceeds the surface tension of the solution. This produces an extremely fine jet of the liquid, drying as it squirts out of the syringe, and stretching out even further by electrostatic repulsion.Electrospinning technology also offers one of the simplest and cheapest ways to prepare nanofibers, as well as being straightforward to operate.The microstructure, diameter, orientation and stacking density of the fibers obtained by electrospinning can also be adjusted by changing the process parameters. By adding magnetic metal elements to the electrospinning precursor solution, after the electrospinning and a high-temperature thermal treatment, the resulting nano-fibrous composite membranes produce significant magnetic loss that significantly enhances the electromagnetic wave attenuation performance.The researchers electrospun a novel composite of two-dimensional MXene nanosheets combined with magnetic iron and nickel nanoparticles, as well as one-dimensional carbon nanofibers (CNFs). The multi-dimensional composite electromagnetic protective fabric obtained by electrospinning effectively avoids an agglomeration of 1D structures and a self-stacking of 2D structures\u2014challenges that have bedeviled earlier MXene electromagnetic absorber material manufactured in the past\u2014while slashing costs and eliminating the difficulty of processing.Their material indeed beat the previous best performer, achieving an electromagnetic absorption performance of -54.1 decibels at 2.7 mm, while offering high flexibility and a lightweight waterproofing that offers a superior durability to the protective fabric in harsh environments.

  "text": "To many, EV stands for \"electric vehicle.\" To researchers at Harvard University and the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln, it's shorthand for another vehicle\u2014this one nanoscopic\u2014that might help streamline the development and delivery of vaccines worldwide.          By repurposing one of the human body's natural cargo transports, a Harvard-Nebraska team has developed a vaccine platform that could curb certain engineering challenges, storage demands and side effects of vaccines that combat HIV epidemics and the COVID-19 pandemic. The team's platform also showed promise in early trials with mice, ramping up antibody production when pitted against HIV and improving survival rates in the face of influenza.\"We believe that this delivery system can enhance the immune response, particularly by inducing antibodies against viral infection,\" said Shi-Hua Xiang, associate professor of veterinary medicine and biomedical sciences at Nebraska.Historically, vaccines have consisted of weakened or inactivated viruses that are recognized by the human immune system, which responds with antibodies and cellular reinforcements that can remember and later fend off infectious forms of those viruses. For reasons of safety and effectiveness, though, many vaccines now instead consist of the lockpicking proteins that coat the surfaces of viruses\u2014so-called antigens that the immune system recognizes as a threat to infiltrate cells.But to stimulate recognition and immunity, the surface-level antigens in vaccines have to adopt the same three-dimensional poses they strike on viruses themselves. Unfortunately for vaccinologists, coaxing antigens into their native configurations can prove a difficult task.The genetic material of HIV, for instance, is enclosed in an envelope that also stabilizes one of the key proteins protruding from it. Persuading the protein to keep that configuration when uprooted from its viral foundation can mean pairing it with a similar surface or even splicing certain genes into its DNA, a feat that costs time and money.Across 20-plus years of working on HIV vaccines, Xiang had often engaged in those feats of protein engineering himself. Then, in September 2017, Harvard's Quan Lu visited Lincoln to give a seminar on a new type of extracellular vesicle: a nanoscopic particle, encased in a double layer of lipids, that ferries nucleic acids and other freight around the body.      Xiang, who attended Lu's talk, knew that lipid bilayers form the membranes of not just EVs and cells, but many viruses, too. The budding process that generated Lu's EVs also resembled that of viruses. And EVs were roughly the same size as their viral counterparts. Those similarities got Xiang thinking.\"My thought,\" he said, \"was that maybe we could collaborate on a study.\"Alongside some colleagues, Xiang and Lu were soon looking into whether the latter's new EV might recruit viral antigens to its surface, lock in their poses, and ultimately stimulate immune responses to them. The researchers started by introducing the EV to an influenza protein that, because of its presence across many different flu strains, has become the subject of the search for a universal flu vaccine. One particular domain of the EV not only drew in and fused with the flu antigen, it also helped promote the budding of more EVs than would otherwise be expected.Encouraged, the team put its resulting EV to the test in mice. While mice facing the flu without a vaccine survived less than 30% of the time, those given three doses of the EV-based vaccine survived in 60-70% of cases. The vaccine was stimulating high levels of antibodies, the team found, with the antibodies then binding to and neutralizing the flu virus. When the researchers swapped out the flu antigen for an HIV protein, they again saw promising production of neutralizing antibodies in the serum of mice immunized with the vaccine.Xiang said the platform may boast a couple of advantages even over mRNA vaccines\u2014those that work by instructing cells to churn out antigens and have proven their worth against the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19. Compared with the mRNA vaccines, which are shipped frozen and can be prone to breaking down over time, an EV-based vaccine will offer more stability and should remain viable at higher temperatures, he said.Those advantages, Xiang said, could eventually push the EV platform to the forefront of vaccine design, production and delivery.The findings are published in the journal Science Advances.

  "text": "With some careful twisting and stacking, MIT physicists have revealed a new and exotic property in \"magic-angle\" graphene: superconductivity that can be turned on and off with an electric pulse, much like a light switch.          The discovery could lead to ultrafast, energy-efficient superconducting transistors for neuromorphic devices\u2014electronics designed to operate in a way similar to the rapid on/off firing of neurons in the human brain.Magic-angle graphene refers to a very particular stacking of graphene\u2014an atom-thin material made from carbon atoms that are linked in a hexagonal pattern resembling chicken wire. When one sheet of graphene is stacked atop a second sheet at a precise \"magic\" angle, the twisted structure creates a slightly offset \"moir\u00e9\" pattern, or superlattice, that is able to support a host of surprising electronic behaviors.In 2018, Pablo Jarillo-Herrero and his group at MIT were the first to demonstrate magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. They showed that the new bilayer structure could behave as an insulator, much like wood, when they applied a certain continuous electric field. When they upped the field, the insulator suddenly morphed into a superconductor, allowing electrons to flow, friction-free.That discovery gave rise to \"twistronics,\" a field that explores how certain electronic properties emerge from the twisting and layering of two-dimensional materials. Researchers including Jarillo-Herrero have continued to reveal surprising properties in magic-angle graphene, including various ways to switch the material between different electronic states. So far, such \"switches\" have acted more like dimmers, in that researchers must continuously apply an electric or magnetic field to turn on superconductivity, and keep it on.Now Jarillo-Herrero and his team have shown that superconductivity in magic-angle graphene can be switched on, and kept on, with just a short pulse rather than a continuous electric field. The key, they found was a combination of twisting and stacking.In a paper appearing today in Nature Nanotechnology, the team reports that, by stacking magic-angle graphene between two offset layers of boron nitride\u2014a two-dimensional insulating material\u2014the unique alignment of the sandwich structure enabled the researchers to turn graphene's superconductivity on and off with a short electric pulse.\"For the vast majority of materials, if you remove the electric field, zzzzip, the electric state is gone,\" says Jarillo-Herrero, who is the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics at MIT. \"This is the first time that a superconducting material has been made that can be electrically switched on and off, abruptly. This could pave the way for a new generation of twisted, graphene-based superconducting electronics.\"His MIT co-authors are lead author Dahlia Klein, Li-Qiao Xia, and David MacNeill, along with Kenji Watanabe and Takashi Taniguchi of the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan.      Flipping the switchIn 2019, a team at Stanford University discovered that magic-angle graphene could be coerced into a ferromagnetic state. Ferromagnets are materials that retain their magnetic properties, even in the absence of an externally applied magnetic field.The researchers found that magic-angle graphene could exhibit ferromagnetic properties in a way that could be tuned on and off. This happened when the graphene sheets were layered between two sheets of boron nitride such that the crystal structure of the graphene was aligned to one of the boron nitride layers.The arrangement resembled a cheese sandwich in which the top slice of bread and the cheese orientations are aligned, but the bottom slice of bread is rotated at a random angle with respect to the top slice. The result intrigued the MIT group.\"We were trying to get a stronger magnet by aligning both slices,\" Jarillo-Herrero says. \"Instead, we found something completely different.\"In their current study, the team fabricated a sandwich of carefully angled and stacked materials. The \"cheese\" of the sandwich consisted of magic-angle graphene\u2014two graphene sheets, the top rotated slightly at the \"magic\" angle of 1.1 degrees with respect to the bottom sheet. Above this structure, they placed a layer of boron nitride, exactly aligned with the top graphene sheet. Finally, they placed a second layer of boron nitride below the entire structure and offset it by 30 degrees with respect to the top layer of boron nitride.The team then measured the electrical resistance of the graphene layers as they applied a gate voltage. They found, as others have, that the twisted bilayer graphene switched electronic states, changing between insulating, conducting, and superconducting states at certain known voltages.What the group did not expect was that each electronic state persisted rather than immediately disappearing once the voltage was removed\u2014a property known as bistability. They found that, at a particular voltage, the graphene layers turned into a superconductor, and remained superconducting, even as the researchers removed this voltage.This bistable effect suggests that superconductivity can be turned on and off with short electric pulses rather than a continuous electric field, similar to flicking a light switch. It isn't clear what enables this switchable superconductivity, though the researchers suspect it has something to do with the special alignment of the twisted graphene to both boron nitride layers, which enables a ferroelectric-like response of the system. (Ferroelectric materials display bistability in their electric properties.)\"By paying attention to the stacking, you could add another tuning knob to the growing complexity of magic-angle, superconducting devices,\" Klein says.For now, the team sees the new superconducting switch as another tool researchers can consider as they develop materials for faster, smaller, more energy-efficient electronics.\"People are trying to build electronic devices that do calculations in a way that's inspired by the brain,\" Jarillo-Herrero says. \"In the brain, we have neurons that, beyond a certain threshold, they fire. Similarly, we now have found a way for magic-angle graphene to switch superconductivity abruptly, beyond a certain threshold. This is a key property in realizing neuromorphic computing.\" More information:Dahlia Klein, Electrical switching of a bistable moir\u00e9 superconductor, Nature Nanotechnology (2023).

  "text": "Rice University researchers already knew the atoms in perovskites react favorably to light. Now they can see precisely how those atoms move.          A breakthrough in visualization supports their efforts to squeeze every possible drop of utility out of perovskite-based materials, including solar cells, a long-standing project that only recently yielded an advance to make the devices far more durable.A study published in Nature Physics details the first direct measurement of structural dynamics under light-induced excitation in 2D perovskites. Perovskites are layered materials that have well-ordered crystal lattices. They are highly efficient harvesters of light that are being explored for use as solar cells, photodetectors, photocatalysts, light-emitting diodes, quantum emitters and more.\"The next frontier in light-to-energy conversion devices is harvesting hot carriers,\" said Rice University's Aditya Mohite, a corresponding author of the study. \"Studies have shown that hot carriers in perovskite can live up to 10\u2013100 times longer than in classical semiconductors. However, the mechanisms and design principles for the energy transfer and how they interact with the lattice are not understood.\"Hot carriers are short-lived, high-energy charge carriers, either electrons for negative charges or electron \"holes\" for positive charges, and having the ability to harvest their energy would allow light-harvesting devices to \"surpass thermodynamic efficiency,\" said Mohite, an associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering in Rice's George R. Brown School of Engineering.Mohite and three members of his research group, senior scientist Jean-Christophe Blancon and graduate students Hao Zhang and Wenbin Li, worked with colleagues at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory to see how atoms in a perovskite lattice rearranged themselves when a hot carrier was created in their midst. They visualized lattice reorganization in real time using ultrafast electron diffraction.      \"Whenever you expose these soft semiconductors to stimuli like electric fields, interesting things happen,\" Mohite said. \"When you generate electrons and holes, they tend to couple to the lattice in unusual and really strong ways, which is not the case for classical materials and semiconductors.\"So there was a fundamental physics question,\" he said. \"Can we visualize these interactions? Can we see how the structure is actually responding at very fast timescales as you put light onto this material?\"The answer was yes, but only with a strong input. SLAC's mega-electron-volt ultrafast electron diffraction (MeV-UED) facility is one of the few places in the world with pulsed lasers capable of creating the electron-hole plasma in perovskites that was needed to reveal how the lattice structure changed in less than a billionth of a second in response to a hot carrier.\"The way this experiment works is that you shoot a laser through the material and then you send an electron beam that goes past it at a very short time delay,\" Mohite explained. \"You start to see exactly what you would in a TEM (transmission electron microscope) image. With the high-energy electrons at SLAC, you can see diffraction patterns from thicker samples, and that allows you to monitor what happens to those electrons and holes and how they interact with the lattice.\"The experiments at SLAC produced before-and-after diffraction patterns that Mohite's team interpreted to show how the lattice changed. They found that after the lattice was excited by light, it relaxed and literally straightened up in as little as one picosecond, or one-trillionth of a second.Zhang said, \"There's a subtle tilting of the perovskite octahedra, which triggers this transient lattice reorganization towards a higher symmetric phase.\"By demonstrating that a perovskite lattice can suddenly become less distorted in response to light, the research showed it should be possible to tune how perovskite lattices interact with light, and it suggested a way to accomplish the tuning.Li said, \"This effect is very dependent on the type of structure and type of organic spacer cation.\"There are many recipes for making perovskites, but all contain organic cations, an ingredient that acts as a spacer between the materials' semiconducting layers. By substituting or subtly changing organic cations, researchers could tailor lattice rigidity, dialing it up or down to alter how the material responds to light, Li said.Mohite said the experiments also show that tuning a perovskite's lattice alters its heat-transfer properties.\"What is generally expected is that when you excite electrons at a very high energy level, they lose their energy to the lattice,\" he said. \"Some of that energy is converted to whatever process you want, but a lot of it is lost as heat, which shows in the diffraction pattern as a loss in intensity.\"The lattice is getting more energy from thermal energy,\" Mohite said. \"That's the classical effect, which is expected, and is well-known as the Debye-Waller factor. But because we can now know exactly what's happening in every direction of the crystal lattice, we see the lattice starts to get more crystalline or ordered. And that's totally counterintuitive.\"A better understanding of how excited perovskites handle heat is a bonus of the research, he said.\"As we make devices smaller and smaller, one of the biggest challenges from a microelectronics perspective is heat management,\" Mohite said. \"Understanding this heat generation and how it's being transported through materials is important.\"When people talk about stacking devices, they need to be able to extract heat very fast,\" he said. \"As we move to new technologies that consume less power and generate less heat, these types of measurements will allow us to directly probe how heat is flowing.\" More information:Hao Zhang et al, Ultrafast relaxation of lattice distortion in two-dimensional perovskites, Nature Physics (2023).

  "text": "When environmental temperatures go below zero, ice crystals are formed on many leaves of evergreen plants. Nevertheless, they usually survive frost phases unharmed. Using a special cryo-scanning electron microscope, researchers from the Zoological Institute of Christian-Albrechts-Universit\u00e4t zu Kiel (CAU) were able to take high-resolution images of icing processes on surfaces of plants native to Germany and Antarctica at the micro- and nanoscales for the first time. In the process, they discovered various tiny structures on the leaf surfaces with which the plants protect themselves against low temperatures.          A better understanding of these protective strategies could also be interesting for the protection of crops or artificial surfaces such as airplanes. The results were published in the journal The Science of Nature.Inspiration for artificial anti-icing surfacesAirplanes are treated with special liquids or are built with heatable surfaces to protect them from icing. Science and industry worldwide are investigating suitable coatings for aviation. \"However, many of our wild plants have developed their own natural protection against icing over the course of evolution,\" explains Professor Stanislav Gorb, head of the research group Functional Morphology and Biomechanics. For more than 20 years, the zoologist has been studying the surfaces of plants at CAU together with his wife Dr. Elena Gorb, a botanist by training.To find out how plants protect themselves against icing, research has so far focused mainly on chemical processes in the cell of plants, such as sugar or other antifreeze content. The research team from Kiel has now been able to show that the surface structure of the leaves also has an important protective function at cold temperatures. For this purpose, the two researchers examined the formation of ice crystals on different types of leaves of native wild plants.\"We could show that fine hairs, so-called trichomes, or a waxy layer on the leaves are effective adaptations of plants to prevent or control icing directly on the leaf surface. If a layer of ice forms directly on the cuticle, the plant's cells will soon freeze as well,\" says Elena Gorb.Leaf surfaces developed different adaptationsThrough investigations in nature and in the laboratory, the two researchers were able to identify different protective mechanisms on the leaves.Plant leaves with trichomes, such as those of the daisy (Bellis perennis), are usually hydrophilic. Therefore ice crystals form first at their tips and as soon as the temperatures rise again, they also melt again quickly here. The sensitive leaf surface underneath remains ice-free and undamaged.Leaf surfaces covered with 3D nanoscale wax projections, such as those of some tulip species (Tulipa gesneriana), on the other hand, are superhydrophobic: Water drops roll off immediately, also known as the \"lotus effect.\" Ice crystals can only form here if water molecules are stopped by defects in the wax layer. But even then they do not damage the wax layer and the leaf underneath remains intact.The scientists found the anti-icing wax strategy of plants not only in Germany, but also at the Antarctic Circle: Deschampsia antarctica, one of the only two flowering plants native to Antarctica, even has a double protection with a prominent epicuticular wax coverage consisting of two superimposed layers on both leaf sides.The researchers suppose in another recent publication in Beilstein Journal of Nanotechnology that the two-layered wax might contribute even more to the plant adaptation to severe environmental conditions in Antarctica due to an increase of its resistance against cold temperatures, icing, harmful UV radiation, and dehydration.Plants with relatively smooth leaves such as the cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus) are the least protected at first glance: Ice crystals can form all over the surface. When exposed to sunlight, the meltwater accumulates in lower-lying areas of the leaf. When temperatures drop again, these \"puddles\" freeze and can cause lasting damage to the plant's cells. \"But since such plants survive the winter, we think they have sufficient chemical antifreeze protection,\" Stanislav Gorb says.      Cryo-microscope enables images at minus 140 degreesThe team was only able to study the nanoscale ice crystals with a cryo-scanning electron microscope. In contrast to other methods, biological samples are not dried here but frozen very quickly. This preserves their structures quite well and allows them to be studied in an almost original state.To do this, the scientists froze the leaves by briefly dipping the leaves in liquid nitrogen at minus 196 degrees. In the microscope, which had been cooled down to minus 140 degrees, high-resolution images of the resulting ice crystals could now be taken. At room temperature, the ice crystals melt again and the process can be repeated. In this way, an intermediate melting in nature like during the day by sunlight can be imitated.\"Ultimately, plants have developed many ways to protect themselves from the cold in the course of evolution,\" Stanislav Gorb says. The interactions with water on the leaf surface promise exciting insights, especially for the development of technical 'anti-icing' surfaces. \"But we still know very little about these processes.\" More information:Stanislav N.

  "text": "University of Twente researchers succeeded in the rapid fabrication of microscopic \"antibubbles.\" Previous methods to produce these liquid droplets surrounded by an air layer were either lacked controllability or were prone to clogging and were much slower. The team of researchers recently published their findings in the journal Advanced Materials.          Antibubbles that are smaller than one millimeter provide many applications in, for example, the food and pharmacy industry. Their hydrophobic\u2014but porous\u2014shell gives the antibubbles an outside air layer for extra protection. Together, both layers can keep the antibubble intact for several days.\"With ultrasound, we can break the hydrophobic shell at a specific moment, after which the antibubble releases its content. This is for example useful for the controlled release of medicines, at specific locations within the body,\" explains first author Jieke Jiang.To create these useful microparticles, the researchers developed a new concept in which a nozzle is jetting through a liquid layer (JetALL). Jiang explains, \"We designed and 3D-printed a small, cone-shaped reservoir that holds the liquid layer. The cone is big enough to prevent clogging but small enough to hold the layer together by its surface tension. The liquid layer is a suspension with silica nanoparticles which forms the outside hydrophobic shell. This shell stabilizes the air layer that forms the antibubbles.\"\"Antibubbles\" -- collecting capsules and the operation of JetALL. Credit: University of TwenteThe new method is rapid; it generates microcapsules at flow rates up to 3,000 capsules per second. The capsules are very similar in size. Jiang said, \"We measured them to be all between 100 to 150 micrometers for one of the samples.\"Other bio-degradable materials, such as polylactic acid (PLA) could also be used as a protective shell, instead of the air layer.

  "text": "The structure of two-dimensional titanium oxide breaks up at high temperatures when one adds barium; instead of regular hexagons, rings of four, seven and ten atoms are created that order aperiodically.          A team at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) made this discovery in collaboration with researchers from the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Microstructure Physics, the Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg, U.S.), thereby solving the riddle of two-dimensional quasicrystal formation from metal oxides. Their findings have been published in Nature Communications.Hexagons are frequently found in nature. The best-known example is honeycomb, but graphene or various metal oxides, such as titanium oxide, also form this structure. \"Hexagons are an ideal pattern for periodic arrangements,\" explains Dr. Stefan F\u00f6rster, researcher in the Surface and Interface Physics group at MLU's Institute of Physics. \"They fit together so perfectly that there are no gaps.\"In 2013, this group made an astonishing discovery upon depositing an ultrathin layer containing titanium oxide and barium on a platinum substrate and heating it to around 1,000 degrees centigrade in ultra-high vacuum. The atoms arranged themselves into triangles, squares and rhombuses that grouped in even larger symmetrical shapes with twelve edges. A structure with 12-fold rotational symmetry was created, instead of the expected 6-fold periodicity.According to F\u00f6rster, \"Quasicrystals were created that have an aperiodic structure. This structure is made of basic atomic clusters that are highly ordered, even if the systematics behind this ordering is difficult for the observer to discern.\" The physicists from Halle were the first worldwide to demonstrate the formation of two-dimensional quasicrystals in metal oxides.The mechanisms underlying the formation of such quasicrystals has remained puzzling since their discovery. The physicists at MLU have now solved this riddle in collaboration with researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Microstructure Physics Halle, the Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg, U.S.).Using elaborate experiments, energetic calculations and high-resolution microscopy, they have shown that high temperatures and the presence of barium create a network of titanium and oxygen rings with four, seven and ten atoms respectively. \"The barium both breaks up the atomic rings and stabilizes them,\" explains F\u00f6rster, who heads the joint project.\"One barium atom is embedded in a ring of seven, two in a ring of ten.\" This is possible because the barium atoms interact electrostatically with the platinum support, but do not form a chemical bond with the titanium or oxygen atoms.With their latest discovery the researchers have done more than just clarify a fundamental question of physics. \"Now that we have a better understanding of the formation mechanisms on the atomic level, we can try to fabricate such two-dimensional quasicrystals on demand in other application-relevant materials like metal oxides or graphene,\" says F\u00f6rster. \"We are excited to learn whether this special arrangement will produce completely new and useful properties.\" More information:Sebastian Schenk et al, 2D honeycomb transformation into dodecagonal quasicrystals driven by electrostatic forces, Nature Communications (2022).

  "answer_squad": " a type of drug that prevents cancer cells from breaking down the excess proteins they produce",
  "text": "Treating cancer with combinations of drugs can be more effective than using a single drug. However, figuring out the optimal combination of drugs, and making sure that all of the drugs reach the right place, can be challenging.          To help address those challenges, MIT chemists have designed a bottlebrush-shaped nanoparticle that can be loaded with multiple drugs, in ratios that can be easily controlled. Using these particles, the researchers were able to calculate and then deliver the optimal ratio of three cancer drugs used to treat multiple myeloma.\"There's a lot of interest in finding synergistic combination therapies for cancer, meaning that they leverage some underlying mechanism of the cancer cell that allows them to kill more effectively, but oftentimes we don't know what that right ratio will be,\" says Jeremiah Johnson, an MIT professor of chemistry and one of the senior authors of the study.In a study of mice, the researchers showed that nanoparticles carrying three drugs in the synergistic ratio they identified shrank tumors much more than when the three drugs were given at the same ratio but untethered to a particle. This nanoparticle platform could potentially be deployed to deliver drug combinations against a variety of cancers, the researchers say.Irene Ghobrial, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and P. Peter Ghoroghchian, president of Ceptur Therapeutics and a former MIT Koch Institute Clinical Investigator, are also senior authors of the paper, which appears today in Nature Nanotechnology. Alexandre Detappe, an assistant professor at the Strasbourg Europe Cancer Institute, and Hung Nguyen Ph.D. '19 are the paper's lead authors.Controlled ratioUsing nanoparticles to deliver cancer drugs allows the drugs to accumulate at the tumor site and reduces toxic side effects because the particles protect the drugs from being released prematurely. However, only a handful of nanoparticle drug formulations have received FDA approval to treat cancer, and only one of these particles carries more than one drug.For several years, Johnson's lab has been working on polymer nanoparticles designed to carry multiple drugs. In the new study, the research team focused on a bottlebrush-shaped particle. To make the particles, drug molecules are inactivated by binding to polymer building blocks and then mixed together in a specific ratio for polymerization. This forms chains that extend from a central backbone, giving the molecule a bottlebrush-like structure with inactivated drugs\u2014prodrugs\u2014along the bottlebrush backbone. Cleavage of the linker that holds the drug to the backbone release the active agent.\"If we want to make a bottlebrush that has two drugs or three drugs or any number of drugs in it, we simply need to synthesize those different drug conjugated monomers, mix them together, and polymerize them. The resulting bottlebrushes have exactly the same size and shape as the bottlebrush that only has one drug, but now they have a distribution of two, three, or however many drugs you want within them,\" Johnson says.In this study, the researchers first tested particles carrying just one drug: bortezomib, which is used to treat multiple myeloma, a cancer that affects a type of B cells known as plasma cells. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor, a type of drug that prevents cancer cells from breaking down the excess proteins they produce. Accumulation of these proteins eventually causes the tumor cells to die.When bortezomib is given on its own, the drug tends accumulate in red blood cells, which have high proteasome concentrations. However, when the researchers gave their bottlebrush prodrug version of the drug to mice, they found that the particles accumulated primarily in plasma cells because the bottlebrush structure protects the drug from being released right away, allowing it to circulate long enough to reach its target.      Synergistic combinationsUsing the bottlebrush particles, the researchers were also able to analyze many different drug combinations to evaluate which were the most effective.Currently, researchers test potential drug combinations by exposing cancer cells in a lab dish to different concentrations of multiple drugs, but those results often don't translate to patients because each drug is distributed and absorbed differently inside the human body.\"If you inject three drugs into the body, the likelihood that the correct ratio of those drugs will arrive at the cancer cell at the same time can be very low. The drugs have different properties that cause them to go to different places, and that hinders the translation of these identified synergistic drug ratios quite immensely,\" Johnson says.However, delivering all three drugs together in one particle could potentially overcome that obstacle and make it easier to deliver synergistic ratios. Because of the ease of creating bottlebrush particles with varying concentrations of drugs, the researchers were able to compare particles carrying different ratios of bortezomib and two other drugs used to treat multiple myeloma: an immunostimulatory drug called pomalidomide, and dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory drug.Exposing these particles to cancer cells in a lab dish revealed combinations that were synergistic, but these combinations were different from the synergistic ratios that had been identified using drugs not bound to the bottlebrush.\"What that tells us is that whenever you are trying to develop a synergistic drug combination that you ultimately plan to administer in a nanoparticle, you should measure synergy in the context of the nanoparticle,\" Johnson says. \"If you measure it for the drugs alone, and then try to make a nanoparticle with that ratio, you can't guarantee it will be as effective.\"New combinationsIn tests in two mouse models of multiple myeloma, the researchers found that three-drug bottlebrushes with a synergistic ratio significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to the free drugs given at the same ratio and to mixtures of three different single-drug bottlebrushes. They also discovered that their bortezomib-only bottlebrushes were very effective at slowing tumor growth when given in higher doses. Although it is approved for blood cancers such as multiple myeloma, bortezomib has never been approved for solid tumors due to its limited therapeutic window and bioavailability.\"We were happy to see that the bortezomib bottlebrush prodrug on its own was an excellent drug, displaying improved efficacy and safety compared to bortezomib, and that has led us to pursue trying to bring this molecule to the clinic as a next-generation proteasome inhibitor,\" Johnson says. \"It has completely different properties than bortezomib and gives you the ability to have a wider therapeutic index to treat cancers that bortezomib has not been used in before.\"Johnson, Nguyen, and Yivan Jiang Ph.D. '19 have founded a company called Window Therapeutics, which is working on further developing these particles for testing in clinical trials. The company also hopes to explore other drug combinations that could be used against other types of cancer.Johnson's lab is also working on using these particles to deliver therapeutic antibodies along with drugs, as well as combining them with larger particles that could deliver messenger RNA along with drug molecules. \"The versatility of this platform gives us endless opportunities to create new combinations,\" he says.

  "text": "A collaboration between teams from the National Graphene Institute (NGI) at The University of Manchester, and the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure (ENS), Paris, demonstrated Hebbian learning in artificial nanochannels, where the channels showed short and long term memory. Hebbian learning is a technical term introduced in 1949 by Donald Hebb, describing the process of learning by repetitively doing an action. The paper is published in the journal Science.          Hebbian learning is a well-known learning mechanism, it is the process when we \"get used\" to doing an action. Similar to what occurs in neural networks, the researchers were able to show the existence of memory in two-dimensional channels which are similar to atomic-scale tunnels with heights varying from several nanometers down to angstroms (10-10 m). This was done using simple salts (including table salt) dissolved in water flowing through nanochannels and by the application of voltage (< 1 V) scans/pulses.The study spotlights the importance of the recent development of ultrathin nanochannels. Two types of nanochannels were used in this study. The \"pristine channels\" were from the Manchester team led by Prof. Radha Boya, which are obtained by the assembly of 2D layers of MoS2. These channels have little surface charge and are atomically smooth. Prof. Lyderic Bocquet's group at ENS developed the \"activated channels,\" these have high surface charge and are obtained by electron beam etching of graphite.An important difference between solid-state and biological memories is that the former works by electrons, while the latter have ionic flows central to their functioning. While solid-state silicon or metal oxide based \"memory devices\" that can \"learn\" have long been developed, this is an important first demonstration of \"learning\" by simple ionic solutions and low voltages. \"The memory effects in nanochannels could have future use in developing nanofluidic computers, logic circuits, and in mimicking biological neuron synapses with artificial nanochannels,\" said co-lead author Prof. Lyderic Bocquet.Co-lead author Prof. Radha Boya, added that \"the nanochannels were able to memorize the previous voltage applied to them and their conductance depends on their history of the voltage application.\" This means the previous voltage history can increase (potentiate in terms of synaptic activity) or decrease (depress) the conduction of the nanochannel.Dr. Abdulghani Ismail from the National Graphene Institute and co-first author of the research said, \"We were able to show two types of memory effects behind which there are two different mechanisms. The existence of each memory type would depend on the experimental conditions (channel type, salt type, salt concentration, etc.).\"Paul Robin from ENS and co-first author of the paper added, \"The mechanism behind memory in 'pristine MoS2 channels' is the transformation of non-conductive ion couples to a conductive ion polyelectrolyte, whereas for 'activated channels' the adsorption/desorption of cations (the positive ions of the salt) on the channel's wall led to the memory effect.\"Dr. Theo Emmerich from ENS and co-first author of the article also commented, \"Our nanofluidic memristor is more similar to the biological memory when compared to the solid-state memristors.\" This discovery could have futuristic applications, from low-power nanofluidic computers to neuromorphic applications.

One might think that nothing new can be discovered from such an everyday material. But now a team from the Vienna University of Technology has presented a study in the journal Nature Communications, explaining the distribution of potassium ions on the mica surface. The physical surface details of mica have never been studied on an atomic scale, and this information is important for research on electronics with 2D materials.Atomically thin layersAtomically thin\u2013layered 2D materials are currently one of the most researched topics in materials science. Certain materials, such as graphene and molybdenum disulfide, consist of only one or a few layers of atoms, which frequently leads to unusual properties.In a sense, mica is a naturally occurring 2D material: It consists of atomically thin layers that can contain different atoms depending on the type of mica: oxygen is always present, often silicon, often potassium or aluminum as well. The layer structure of the mica is also the reason for its characteristic sheen\u2014you can often see a spectrum of colors, similar to a thin layer of oil on a puddle of water.Potassium ions in ultra high vacuumThe outermost layer of mica is difficult to examine because it is quickly contaminated by atoms and molecules from the air. The researchers imaged the surface of mica in an ultra-high vacuum, using a new type of atomic force microscope at the Vienna University of Technology.\"We were able to see how the potassium ions are distributed on the surface,\" says Giada Franceschi, the first author of the current paper, who works in Prof. Ulrike Diebold's team. \"We were also able to gain insights into the positions of the aluminum ions under the surface layer\u2014this is a particularly difficult task experimentally.\"The images show that the potassium ions are not randomly distributed on the surface, as previously assumed, but are arranged in tiny patterns. These distributions could also be calculated with the help of computer simulations.Matching insulator for 2D electronicsThis work could be important for, among other things, attempts to use 2D materials such as graphene for electronic circuits. Suitable insulators are needed for this, and mica is a very obvious candidate.\"The surface properties of mica will play a crucial role in such electronic components,\" says Giada Franceschi.

  "text": "Mobile phone batteries with a lifetime up to three times longer than today's technology could be a reality thanks to an innovation led by engineers at RMIT University.          Rather than disposing of batteries after two or three years, we could have recyclable batteries that last for up to nine years, the team says, by using high-frequency sound waves to remove rust that inhibits battery performance.The research is published in Nature Communications.Only 10% of used handheld batteries, including for mobile phones, are collected for recycling in Australia, which is low by international standards. The remaining 90% of batteries go to landfill or are disposed of incorrectly, which causes considerable damage to the environment.The high cost of recycling lithium and other materials from batteries is a major barrier to these items being reused, but the team's innovation could help to address this challenge.The team are working with a nanomaterial called MXene, a class of materials that they say promises to be an exciting alternative to lithium for batteries in the future.Leslie Yeo, Distinguished Professor of Chemical Engineering from RMIT's School of Engineering and lead senior researcher, said MXene was similar to graphene with high electrical conductivity.\"Unlike graphene, MXenes are highly tailorable and open up a whole range of possible technological applications in the future,\" said Yeo.The big challenge with using MXene was that it rusted easily, thereby inhibiting electrical conductivity and rendering it unusable, he said, adding, \"To overcome this challenge, we discovered that sound waves at a certain frequency remove rust from MXene, restoring it to close to its original state.\"The team's innovation could one day help to revitalize MXene batteries every few years, extending their lifetime up to three times, he said.\"The ability to prolong the shelf life of MXene is critical to ensuring its potential to be used for commercially viable electronic parts,\" Yeo said.

Credit: RMIT University             How the innovation works Co-lead author Hossein Alijani, a Ph.D. candidate from RMIT's School of Engineering, said the greatest challenge with using MXene was the rust that forms on its surface in a humid environment or when suspended in watery solutions.\"Surface oxide, which is rust, is difficult to remove, especially on this material, which is much, much thinner than a human hair,\" said Alijani. \"Current methods used to reduce oxidation rely on the chemical coating of the material, which limits the use of the MXene in its native form. In this work, we show that exposing an oxidized MXene film to high-frequency vibrations for just a minute removes the rust on the film. This simple procedure allows its electrical and electrochemical performance to be recovered.\"      The potential applications of the team's workThe team says their work to remove rust from Mxene opens the door for the nanomaterial to be used in a wide range of applications in energy storage, sensors, wireless transmission and environmental remediation.Associate Professor Amgad Rezk from RMIT's School of Engineering, one of the lead senior researchers, said the ability to quickly restore oxidized materials to an almost pristine state represented a gamechanger in terms of the circular economy.\"Materials used in electronics, including batteries, generally suffer deterioration after two or three years of use due to rust forming,\" said Rezk. \"With our method, we can potentially extend the lifetime of battery components by up to three times.\"While the innovation is promising, the team needs to work with industry to integrate its acoustics device into existing manufacturing systems and processes. The team is also exploring the use of their invention to remove oxide layers from other materials for applications in sensing and renewable energy.\"We are keen to collaborate with industry partners so that our method of rust removal can be scaled up,\" Yeo said.

  "text": "Without the force called friction, cars would skid off the roadway, humans couldn't stride down the sidewalk, and objects would tumble off your kitchen counter and onto the floor. Even so, how friction works at a molecular scale remains poorly understood.          Using complex modeling and computer simulations, a team led by a postdoctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering and Krieger School of Arts and Sciences studied friction at both the molecular and macroscopic scale. The team's study results, which appear in ACS Nano, not only shed light on friction in general, but could also inform the design of improved prosthetic devices and artificial joints.\"Friction is puzzling because it is not governed by a single interaction, like attraction between charges; it emerges from a combination of processes that can occur at different scales. In our work, we tried to link the nano and macro worlds for a particular feature of friction called aging, which is when one solid rests on another for a long time without sliding, the force needed to slide them apart increases. We wanted to find out why,\" said Lucas Fr\u00e9rot, now a postdoc at Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t's Institut for Mikrosystemtechnik.Research team members at Laboratoire de Tribologie et Dynamique des Syst\u00e8mes at \u00c9cole Centrale de Lyon in France had previously conducted experiments that gave a very detailed picture of the friction response of surfaces coated with fatty acids, an environmentally friendly family of lubricants, but those alone could not explain the phenomenon behind aging.Using measurements of surface roughness and the properties of the single-molecule-thick layer of fatty acid molecules, the team at Johns Hopkins was able to reproduce the aging process in a molecular simulation.\"Our simulation allowed us to try things impossible in experiments, such as what would happen if the surfaces in contact were mathematically flat,\" said team member Jaafar El-Awady, professor of mechanical engineering at the Whiting School.They found that the main cause of aging was surface roughness. In fact, the models without roughness did not age at all, according to Fr\u00e9rot.\"This was surprising because the surface roughness measured by the team in Lyon was extremely small; the highest mountain and the deepest valley of the surface would be separated by about the length of one fatty acid molecule,\" he said.The team concluded that even such a small amount of roughness is enough to prevent the molecules from making contact over the whole surface, leaving the molecules on the edges of contact spots free to move. Over time, more molecules come in contact, resulting in aging.Although the mechanism discovered is not the only one that can explain why frictional systems age, the team believes it can be applied to a wide range of systems where chain-like molecules such as the fatty acids they studied form a protective layer on a surface.\"This is the case in biological systems like joints, and if we understand those systems better, we can design better and more durable prostheses. In a more general sense, understanding the physics behind friction is important in the design of sustainable systems. Some studies estimate that about 23% of the world's energy consumption is lost to friction,\" Fr\u00e9rot said.Research team members note that the design of the simulations used in this study were originally envisioned by Mark O. Robbins, a former colleague at Johns Hopkins Department of Physics and Astronomy, who died in 2020.\"Lucas and I then continued to push on the simulations with our collaborators to achieve its goals successfully, and to dedicate it to Mark's memory,\" El-Awady said.

  "text": "Scientists working on laser application at the RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics (RAP) have demonstrated that GHz burst mode femtosecond laser pulses can create unique two-dimensional (2D) laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) on silicon substrates.          Previously, the team led by the researchers from the Advanced Laser Processing Research Team has reported that the GHz burst mode femtosecond laser pulses consisting of a series of trains of ultrashort laser pulses with a pulse interval of several hundred picoseconds (ps) greatly improve the ablation efficiency and quality as compared with the conventional femtosecond laser processing (single-pulse mode).Published in International Journal of Extreme manufacturing (IJEM), the team applied the GHz burst mode to fabricate LIPSS on silicon substrates to show the ability of GHz burst for formation of unique nanostructures. They have demonstrated that the GHz burst mode femtosecond laser pulses create unique 2D LIPSS, that is distinct from the 1D structures fabricated by the conventional single-pulse mode of linearly polarized femtosecond laser.In addition to 1D LIPSS fabricated by the single-pulse mode, whose direction is perpendicular to the laser polarization, another periodic structures parallel to the polarization direction are formed to create a lattice-like pattern by the GHz bust mode. Achievements of this study have shown that the GHz burst mode femtosecond laser processing offers distinguished advantages for not only ablation of materials but also other types of processing such as LIPSS formation, which opens a new avenue for micro and nanofabrication.The team has further proposed a possible mechanism for the formation of 2D LIPSS formed by the GHz burst mode, which is regarded as the synergetic contribution of the electromagnetic and hydrodynamic mechanisms. Specifically, the generation of hotspots with highly enhanced electric fields by the localized surface plasmon resonance of subsequent pulses in the bursts within the nanogrooves of 1D LIPSS formed by the preceding pulses creates 2D LIPSS.Additionally, hydrodynamic instability including convection flow determines the final structure of 2D LIPSS. Based on this hypothesis, they successfully created well-defined 2D LIPSS by tailoring the envelope of the GHz burst.      Formation of LIPSS is a well-known phenomenon, which is realized on diverse solid surfaces by merely irradiating the material surfaces with multiple pulses of linearly polarized laser beam even in the air. Importantly LIPSS can functionalize the material surfaces to achieve surface coloring, reduction of friction, control of surface wettability, etc., which is attracting considerable interest in industrial applications.The ability of the GHz burst mode enabling the fabrication of 2D LIPSS will offer the possibility of the formation of more functionalized surfaces and thereby diversify the application and accelerate the commercialization.Corresponding author, Prof. Koji Sugioka, said that \"The results that the GHz burst mode femtosecond laser pulses can enhance the ablation efficiency with improved ablation quality, reported by Ilday's group in 2016, have overturned common sense and significantly impacted the community of laser materials processing. Immediately after that, some groups including our group started to carry out experiments on GHz burst mode ablation of different types of materials for more detailed investigation.\"\"In the process of the GHz burst mode ablation study, we considered that more controlled energy deposition as compared with the single-pulse mode may also offer some advantages to other kinds of materials processing. Then, we applied the GHz burst mode to LIPSS formation and succeeded in showing interesting results.\"\"The obtained results may offer a new possibility of GHz burst mode for processing other than ablation, including microbonding, crystallization, polishing, two-photon polymerization, and internal optical waveguide writing. Thus, we believe that GHz burst mode will open new paths to femtosecond laser processing.\"One of the co-authors, Prof. Godai Miyaji, said that \"Ultrashort pulse laser subtractive manufacturing is induced by three dominant phenomena of nonlinear optical absorption inside the material, energy transfer such as electron-electron scattering and electron-lattice scattering, and phonon excitation, and ablation. Here, the relaxation time of the excited state of the material is in a region of femtosecond to sub-microsecond. The conventional single-pulse mode induces ablation by the interaction process between femtosecond laser pulse and static material, while the GHz burst mode interacts with excited material in relaxation.\"\"It is expected to induce not only efficient and particular optical absorption by transiently changing in its dielectric constant but also the electromagnetic mechanical interactions under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. This is a unique physical process that cannot be realized and controlled by the conventional single-pulse mode and is expected to open up new fields in science and technology, including the realization of novel ablation shapes and the creation of new materials through novel bonding structural changes.\" More information:Shota Kawabata et al, Two-dimensional laser-induced periodic surface structures formed on crystalline silicon by GHz burst mode femtosecond laser pulses, International Journal of Extreme Manufacturing (2023).

The microscopic makeup of these natural surfaces may hold the key to better applications in human technologies, studies by Flinders University and international collaborators have found.\"Our study looked at the special structure of the ribletted surfaces of some sharks which enables them to reduce drag and friction in fast-swimming sharks while also deterring microscopic marine organisms from adhering to their skin,\" says Flinders University Professor Youhong Tang, from the College of Science and Engineering.\"The shape of riblets on the skin surface influences the effectiveness of the drag reduction greatly, with the riblet surfaces performing best when aligned parallel to the flow direction.\"Led by Chinese naval architecture and ocean design and engineering collaborators, the research is focusing on developing a simple biomimetic turbulent drag reduction topology on this shark skin-inspired research modeling.This will be used to guide design of more fuel efficient marine surfaces, including cargo ships and pipelines, which also may not be as prone to attracting aquatic biofilm buildup which drags on shipping hulls.Answers to leading scientific questions have been found in nature, with other Flinders University, La Trobe University and other researchers describing the potential of antibacterial powers of insect wings.\"The wings of dragonflies and cicadas have evolved to use the structural features of their surface to attain bactericidal properties,\" says Flinders University researcher Dr. Vi Khanh Truong, from the Flinders Biomedical Nanoengineering Laboratory.\"The nanopillars or nanospikes present on these natural materials physically damage the bacterial cells that settle on the nanostructures resulting in cell lysis and death.\"This study looks at these natural surfaces to provide guidelines for the design of synthetic bio-inspired materials and also create some novel fabrication techniques used to produce biomimetic micro- and nano-structures on synthetic material surfaces.\"It is estimated that infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria claim 700,000 lives each year.

  "text": "Novel drugs, such as vaccines against COVID-19, among others, are based on drug transport using nanoparticles. Whether this drug transport is negatively influenced by an accumulation of blood proteins on the nanoparticle's surface was not clarified for a long time.          Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research have now followed the path of such a particle into a cell using a combination of several microscopy methods. They were able to observe a cell-internal process that effectively separates blood components and nanoparticles.Nanoparticles are a current field of research and it is impossible to imagine modern medicine without them. They serve as microscopic drug capsules that are less than a thousandth of a millimeter in diameter. Among other things, they are used in current vaccines against COVID-19 to effectively deliver active ingredients to where they are actually needed. In most cases, the capsules dock onto cells, are enveloped by them, and are absorbed into them. Inside the cell, chemical processes can then open the capsules, releasing the active ingredient.However, this idealized process usually does not take place: As it travels through the bloodstream, blood proteins accumulate on the surface of the nanotransporter. These also find their way into the cell. For a long time, it was an unresolved question whether this process impairs the release of the active ingredient.Scientists working with Ingo Lieberwirth, group leader in Katharina Landfester's department, have now addressed this question. They have labeled a nanoparticle and blood proteins with different fluorescent dyes. As a result, both glow with different colors when viewed through a high-resolution light microscope. At the same time, the researchers were able to observe the process in parallel and at higher resolution using an electron microscope.By combining both methods, the scientists were able to observe that the cell initially absorbs the composite of nanoparticles and blood proteins. In the cell, they now observed something surprising: The protein coating detaches from the nanoparticle and releases it. After some time, proteins and particles are present separately in the cell.\"We therefore assume that the drug release in the cell is not disturbed by the protein coating,\" says Ingo Lieberwirth. \"However, it is now important to find out how exactly the process takes place inside the cell.\"The scientists have now published their results in Nature Communications.

  "text": "Researchers at Kanazawa University report in Nano Letters how high-speed atomic force microscopy can be used to assess the effectivity of spike-neutralizing antibodies for preventing COVID-19. The use of such antibodies offers a promising alternative to vaccines.          Vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) developed and produced during the COVID-19 pandemic offer a significant degree of protection. However, after the second dose of a vaccine, protection only lasts up to eight months and requires multiple booster doses afterwards.An alternative pathway to prevention and treatment of COVID-19 lies in so-called spike-neutralizing antibodies (SNABs) that neutralize the effect of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the protein mediating entry of the virus into a host cell. Being able to properly study the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and SNABs is crucial for developing effective treatment\u2014dynamically visualizing these interactions is particularly desirable.Keesiang Lim from Kanazawa University and colleagues have now succeeded in video-imaging protein\u2013SNAB interactions by means of high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). They were able to identify the molecular mechanisms at play, and by doing so demonstrated that HS-AFM offers a unique nanoscopic assessment platform for evaluating the intermolecular binding properties of SNABs.One of the main reasons for the need to study protein\u2013SNAB interactions is to check that they do not lead to a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), which refers to the situation when a virus enhances its entry potential by binding to a \"suboptimal\" antibody. Lim and colleagues used HS-AFM to investigate the ADE risk, as the method is a powerful nanoimaging tool for visualizing molecular structures and the dynamics of biochemical interactions involving viruses.The scientists first looked at how a SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein binds to a SNAB. They identified how the structure of the protein\u2013SNAB complex blocks infection, and could conclude that, based on the obtained structural information, ADE risk is negligible. Then, to simulate the dynamic interaction between SNABs and variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, Lim and colleagues created small extracellular vesicles (\"biocontainers\" surrounded by a membrane, residing outside cells) capable of producing spike proteins. From these experiments, the researchers concluded viral surface roughness can enhance the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 variants. They also found that SNAB could neutralize the delta variant spike protein.The work of Lim and colleagues shows that HS-AFM provides an excellent nanoscopic assessment tool for studying the binding pattern of SNABs and the dynamic interaction between SNABs and spike protein-mimicking extracellular vesicles. Quoting the researchers: \"These results are essential for the screening of appropriate SNABs with a lower risk of ADE to treat COVID-19.\"      High-speed atomic force microscopyThe general principle of atomic force microscopy (AFM) is to make a very small tip scan the surface of a sample. During this horizontal (xy) scan, the tip, which is attached to a small cantilever, follows the sample's vertical (z) profile, inducing a force on the cantilever that can be measured. The magnitude of the force at the xy position can be related to the z value; the xyz data generated during a scan then result in a height map providing structural information about the investigated sample.In high-speed-AFM (HS-AFM), the working principle is slightly more involved: the cantilever is made to oscillate near its resonance frequency. When the tip is moved around a surface, the variations in the amplitude (or the frequency) of the cantilever's oscillation\u2014resulting from the tip's interaction with the sample's surface\u2014are recorded, as these provide a measure for the local \"z\" value. AFM does not involve lenses, so its resolution is not restricted by the so-called diffraction limit as in X-ray diffraction, for example.HS-AFM results in a video, where the time interval between frames depends on the speed with which a single image can be generated (by xy-scanning the sample). Researchers at Kanazawa University have in recent years developed HS-AFM further, so that it can be applied to study biochemical molecules and biomolecular processes in real-time. Keesiang Lim and colleagues have now applied to method to study the process in which a spike-neutralizing antibody binds to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, thereby preventing it from entering a host cell.

  "text": "When used as wearable medical devices, stretchy, flexible gas sensors can identify health conditions or issues by detecting oxygen or carbon dioxide levels in the breath or sweat. They also are useful for monitoring air quality in indoor or outdoor environments by detecting gas, biomolecules and chemicals. But manufacturing the devices, which are created using nanomaterials, can be a challenge.          Penn State researchers recently enhanced their gas sensor manufacturing process through an in situ laser-assisted manufacturing approach, improving on their previous method of drop casting, or dropping materials one by one onto a substrate using a pipette. They published their results in the Chemical Engineering Journal.\"With drop casting, you have to synthesize each part of the sensor separately and then integrate them, which is logistically challenging, takes a long time and is expensive,\" said corresponding author Huanyu \"Larry\" Cheng, James L. Henderson, Jr. Memorial Associate Professor of Engineering Science and Mechanics in the Penn State College of Engineering.\u202f\"The in situ method allows the materials to be directly synthesized in one place, and the laser speeds up the process.\"In the process, a laser inscribes nanomaterials directly on top of a porous graphene foam substrate. The base material allows for the sensor to be stretchy and flexible when applied on the skin or an object.According to Cheng, the approach opens opportunities to use different precursors, or nanomaterials, and mix them with different ratios and components. Previously, researchers used graphene oxide and molybdenum disulfide to create the sensors. With the new method, researchers tested four additional classes of materials, including transition metal dichalcogenide, metal oxides, noble metal-doped metal oxides and composite metal oxides.\"A particular nanomaterial allows us to sense different biomarkers or gases, so it's very important for us to get access to different materials,\" Cheng said. \"For example, one nanomaterial usually can only detect one target gas molecule. With multiple choices available, you can potentially detect more molecules, improving the sensing capabilities.\"Using several nanomaterials, researchers created an array of several small sensors placed side by side. The capabilities of the array can be compared to a human nose, Cheng said.\"The nose evolved to detect millions of smells using millions of cells,\" Cheng said. \"In the same way, each of the sensors is able to detect a different chemical or particle.\"With the new sensor design, researchers eliminated the need for a separate heat source, further decreasing the complexity of manufacturing the device. The new design integrates the gas-sensitive nanomaterials on a single line of porous graphene foam, as compared with the old design, where nanomaterials filled the gaps between electrodes. The resistance in the single line of porous graphene foam induces Joule heat for self-heating.The result is a sophisticated sensor that has several applications, including monitoring and alerting the user of a quick uptick in gases, such as on an industrial site, or an accumulation of gases over time, such as in the case of pollution.In the future, researchers plan to improve the sensor's capabilities by programming nanomaterial composites to target specific gases or to identify multiple gas species in complex mixtures.

  "text": "Gene therapies have the potential to treat neurological disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, but they face a common barrier\u2014the blood-brain barrier. Now, researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have developed a way to move therapies across the brain's protective membrane to deliver brain-wide therapy with a range of biological medications and treatments.          \"There is no cure yet for many devastating brain disorders,\" says Shaoqin \"Sarah\" Gong, UW-Madison professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences and biomedical engineering and researcher at the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery. \"Innovative brain-targeted delivery strategies may change that by enabling noninvasive, safe and efficient delivery of CRISPR genome editors that could, in turn, lead to genome-editing therapies for these diseases.\"CRISPR is a molecular toolkit for editing genes (for example, to correct mutations that may cause disease), but the toolkit is only useful if it can get through security to the job site. The blood-brain barrier is a membrane that selectively controls access to the brain, screening out toxins and pathogens that may be present in the bloodstream. Unfortunately, the barrier bars some beneficial treatments, like certain vaccines and gene therapy packages, from reaching their targets because in lumps them in with hostile invaders.Injecting treatments directly into the brain is one way to get around the blood-brain barrier, but it's an invasive procedure that provides access only to nearby brain tissue.\"The promise of brain gene therapy and genome-editing therapy relies on the safe and efficient delivery of nucleic acids and genome editors to the whole brain,\" Gong says.In a study recently published in the journal Advanced Materials, Gong and her lab members, including postdoctoral researcher and first author of the study Yuyuan Wang, describe a new family of nanoscale capsules made of silica that can carry genome-editing tools into many organs around the body and then harmlessly dissolve.By modifying the surfaces of the silica nanocapsules with glucose and an amino acid fragment derived from the rabies virus, the researchers found the nanocapsules could efficiently pass through the blood-brain barrier to achieve brain-wide gene editing in mice. In their study, the researchers demonstrated the capability of the silica nanocapsule's CRISPR cargo to successfully edit genes in the brains of mice, such as one related to Alzheimer's disease called amyloid precursor protein gene.Because the nanocapsules can be administered repeatedly and intravenously, they can achieve higher therapeutic efficacy without risking more localized and invasive methods.The researchers plan to further optimize the silica nanocapsules' brain-targeting capabilities and evaluate their usefulness for the treatment of various brain disorders. This unique technology is also being investigated for the delivery of biologics to the eyes, liver and lungs, which can lead to new gene therapies for other types of disorders.

The study was published in Nature.          Miniaturization and integration are strategies broadly employed in optical quantum systems to enhance their scalability and stability, thus providing a path to scalable and practical solutions for optical quantum computing and quantum communications.In this study, researchers reported a van der Waals crystal (NbOCl2) featuring monolayer-like excitonic behavior in bulk form, indicating a verified weak interlayer electronic coupling. Theoretical calculations implied that such weak interlayer coupling derived from the strong ionic Nb-Cl bond in the crystal.Second-harmonic generation (SHG) is the lowest-order nonlinear optical process where the second order nonlinear optical susceptibility is responsible for the generation of light at second-harmonic frequency. Despite having a high second-order nonlinear susceptibility, conventional 2D materials (e.g., WS2) show a decreasing SHG response as the layer number increases, while the scalable SHG intensity in NbOCl2 is up to three orders of magnitude higher than that in monolayer WS2.Notably, this newly-reported crystal flake is as thin as 46nm. The strong second-order nonlinearity of crystal NbOCl2 enables a SPDC process, a second-order nonlinear process in which a photon from a strong pump laser is converted to a photon pair, which means a detection of one photon of the pair heralds the presence of the other.The discovery makes crystal NbOCl2 both the thinnest and the first two-dimensional SPDC source ever reported.The findings of this study not only provide an integrable quantum light source for optical quantum information technology, but also open a new direction in the study of optical nonlinearity in two-dimensional materials.

  "text": "Graphene-based olfactory sensors that can detect odor molecules based on the design of peptide sequences were recently demonstrated by researchers at Tokyo Tech. The findings indicated that graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) functionalized with designable peptides can be used to develop electronic devices that mimic olfactory receptors and emulate the sense of smell by selectively detecting odor molecules.          Olfactory sensing or odor sensing is an integral part of many industries including health care, food, cosmetics, and environmental monitoring. At present, the most commonly used technique for detecting and estimating odor molecules is gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS). Though very effective, GC\u2013MS has some limitations, such as its bulky setup and limited sensitivity. As a consequence, scientists have been looking for more sensitive and easy-to-use alternatives.In recent years, graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) have begun being used to develop highly sensitive and selective odor sensors by integrating with olfactory receptors, also known as electronic noses. The atomically flat surfaces and high electron mobility of graphene surfaces make GFETs ideal for adsorbing odor molecules. However, the application of GFET as electrical biosensors with the receptors is severely limited by factors, such as the fragility of receptors and the lack of alternative synthetic molecules that can function as olfactory receptors.A team of researchers from Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech) led by Prof. Yuhei Hayamizu set out to address these issues with GFET-based olfactory receptors. In their recent study published in Biosensors and Bioelectronics, the team designed and developed three new peptides for graphene biosensors that can detect odor molecules.Prof. Hayamizu explains \"The sequence of peptides we designed needed to perform two main functions\u2014acting as a biomolecular scaffold for self-assembly on a graphene surface and functioning as a bio-probe to bind the odor molecules. This would allow the peptides to cover the graphene surface in a self-assembling manner and functionalize the surface uniformly to capture odor molecules.\"The team carried out atomic force microscopy which showed that the peptides uniformly covered the graphene surface with the thickness of a single molecule. The functionalized graphene was then used to build a GFET setup for detecting odor molecules. After the assembly, the team injected limonene, menthol, and methyl salicylate as representative odor molecules into the GFET. The electrochemical measurements indicated that binding with the odor molecules reduced the conductivity of the graphene. The observations also revealed that the interaction between the three peptide sequences and the odor molecule gave rise to very distinct signatures. This confirmed that the GFET's response to the odor molecules depended on the peptide design.Furthermore, the team carried out real-time electrical measurements to monitor the kinetic response of the GFET. The observations indicated that the time constraint associated with the adsorption and desorption of odor molecules was unique for each of the peptide sequences. This behavior was further confirmed by principal component analysis. These observations confirmed that the new GFET setup was successful in electrically detecting the odor molecules with the help of the designed peptides.\"Our approach is simple and can be scaled up for mass production of peptide-based olfactory receptors that can mimic and miniaturize the natural protein receptors responsible for our sense of smell. We are a step closer to realizing the concept of electronic noses,\" says Prof. Hayamizu.The robust approach presented in this study opens new doors for the development of highly selective and sensitive GFET-based odor-sensing systems. These insights can also be put to use when designing advanced peptide sensors that can carry out multi-dimensional analysis of a range of odor molecules.

  "text": "Sticking swabs up our noses and down our throats to confirm or deny whether we are infected with the coronavirus\u2014almost all of us have done it multiple times in the last couple of years.          The methods that have been used to detect and prevent the spread of the virus have been the same around the world, either:the expensive, time-consuming but very accurate PCR method where the DNA of the virus is detected in our mucous membranes, orthe simpler and faster method that only indicates whether we have developed antibodies against the virus.Ultra-fast detectionHowever, both methods have their weaknesses. The PCR method is expensive and time-consuming, while the antibody method does not tell us anything about whether we actually have the virus in the body. A simple and affordable way to detect the virus that provides a quick result would therefore be helpful.Now researchers from NTNU, Oslomet and the University of Tabriz in East Azerbaijan have demonstrated a method for detecting coronavirus in blood samples using nanosensors.\"A lot of research focuses on finding methods to quickly isolate infected people, which can break the chain of infection. Nanosensors have received a lot of attention due to their unique properties for ultra-fast detection of particles such as viruses,\" says Amir Maghoul. He is a researcher and the first author of the article \"An Optical Modeling Framework for Coronavirus Detection Using Graphene-Based Nanosensor.\" He was a post-doctoral fellow at NTNU when he started his work.A first step on the pathway to developing a separate nanosensor for the coronavirus is to identify the optical properties that distinguish the coronavirus from other particles in our blood.Ingve Simonsen, a physics professor at NTNU, explains. Most people have seen the coronavirus depicted as a round core or ball with red \"spikes\" or stems sticking out. \"We wanted to see what role the length and size of these \"spikes\" play in how the cells reflect light, as well as whether the size of the nucleus matters,\" says Simonsen.Displaces resonanceTo find answers to their questions, the researchers used mathematical models. The optical behavior of the virus\u2014that is, how the virus cell reflects light in the form of resonance\u2014was simulated and analyzed over the entire light spectrum.\"We observed that the reflectivity varied with the length of the spike proteins. As the spikes get longer, the reflectivity decreases at the same time as the resonance shifts to higher wavelengths,\" says Simonsen.The researchers observed the same response when they varied the size of the virus' core in the models. The width of the spike protein had less effect on how the light was reflected. In this way, the researchers could find out in which part of the wavelength spectrum the coronavirus differs from other particles in the blood.\"At certain wavelengths, we get a different optical response depending on whether viruses are present or not. We call this the optical signature of the coronavirus,\" says Simonsen.\"We know that the optical properties of particles change depending on their environment. They behave differently if they're in water or in a vacuum, if several particles are next to each other or if the surface is covered with a thin layer of another substance.\"                The nanomaterial graphene is used in the new COVID test method. Credit: Norwegian University of Science and Technology             Pregnancy test exampleThe first person to describe in general terms how spherical particles reflect light waves was the German scientist Gustav Mie in 1908.\"It is well known that ordinary light consists of a spectrum of wavelengths. This is what we see when we look at a rainbow or when light passes through a glass prism. The light hits water molecules in the atmosphere or the prism and is reflected in the light's various wavelengths, which we see as a spectrum of colors,\" says Simonsen.Mie showed how small spheres or nuclei react differently to light.\"For example, small metal particles have a very strong optical response. This characteristic is used in certain types of pregnancy tests that measure the optical response to small gold particles,\" Simonsen says.\"The hormone you look for in the urine\u2014which you only have if you're pregnant\u2014collects on the surface of the gold particles on the test stick and changes the resonance frequency of the particle. The result is a color change to blue, which shows that you're pregnant.\"Rose painting exampleAnother example of how small particles react to light can be seen in stained glass, such as the large rose window in Nidaros Cathedral. The strong red, blue and green colors are all the result of the optical response of the metal particles used in the glass. And it is this property that can be used to detect coronavirus in blood samples.\"What you do is place a network of thin, cylindrical gold particles over a very thin layer of graphene. Graphene is a nanomaterial with a lot of fascinating properties, including the fact that it conducts electricity well and with little loss.\"When blood containing the coronavirus passes over the gold particles, the resonant frequency of the particles changes, which in turn creates an electromagnetic field. This field sets up a current in the sensor that can be easily measured.\"By studying the current curves for certain frequency ranges of the incoming light, we can determine whether the blood contains coronavirus or not,\" says Simonsen.Great potential for nanotechnologyNanosensors have the potential to be very sensitive. The \"smart\" graphene material in the nanodisk acts as an amplifier, explains Amir Maghoul.\"Nanotechnology hasn't been used before for this type of sensor, so this development is new technology. What we've done here is create the first optical framework to detect coronavirus and show how the virus behaves in the optical spectrum,\" says Maghoul.Now the next step is to establish a company that can develop a laboratory prototype for the nanosensor.\"We need to raise money so that we can go ahead and develop a sensor for common use. The collaboration between NTNU and Oslomet has shown that we have facilities with significant potential to develop and produce this type of nanosensor for biomedical use if the work is supported financially,\" says Maghoul.

  "answer_squad": " non-epitaxial, single-crystalline growth",
  "text": "True to Moore's Law, the number of transistors on a microchip has doubled every year since the 1960s. But this trajectory is predicted to soon plateau because silicon\u2014the backbone of modern transistors\u2014loses its electrical properties once devices made from this material dip below a certain size.          Enter 2D materials\u2014delicate, two-dimensional sheets of perfect crystals that are as thin as a single atom. At the scale of nanometers, 2D materials can conduct electrons far more efficiently than silicon. The search for next-generation transistor materials therefore has focused on 2D materials as potential successors to silicon.But before the electronics industry can transition to 2D materials, scientists have to first find a way to engineer the materials on industry-standard silicon wafers while preserving their perfect crystalline form. And MIT engineers may now have a solution.The team has developed a method that could enable chip manufacturers to fabricate ever-smaller transistors from 2D materials by growing them on existing wafers of silicon and other materials. The new method is a form of \"nonepitaxial, single-crystalline growth,\" which the team used for the first time to grow pure, defect-free 2D materials onto industrial silicon wafers.With their method, the team fabricated a simple functional transistor from a type of 2D materials called transition-metal dichalcogenides, or TMDs, which are known to conduct electricity better than silicon at nanometer scales.\"We expect our technology could enable the development of 2D semiconductor-based, high-performance, next-generation electronic devices,\" says Jeehwan Kim, associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. \"We've unlocked a way to catch up to Moore's Law using 2D materials.\"Kim and his colleagues detail their method in a paper appearing in Nature. The study's MIT co-authors include Ki Seok Kim, Doyoon Lee, Celesta Chang, Seunghwan Seo, Hyunseok Kim, Jiho Shin, Sangho Lee, Jun Min Suh, and Bo-In Park, along with collaborators at the University of Texas at Dallas, the University of California at Riverside, Washington University in Saint Louis, and institutions across South Korea.A crystal patchwork To produce a 2D material, researchers have typically employed a manual process by which an atom-thin flake is carefully exfoliated from a bulk material, like peeling away the layers of an onion.But most bulk materials are polycrystalline, containing multiple crystals that grow in random orientations. Where one crystal meets another, the \"grain boundary\" acts as an electric barrier. Any electrons flowing through one crystal suddenly stop when met with a crystal of a different orientation, damping a material's conductivity. Even after exfoliating a 2D flake, researchers must then search the flake for \"single-crystalline\" regions\u2014a tedious and time-intensive process that is difficult to apply at industrial scales.Recently, researchers have found other ways to fabricate 2D materials, by growing them on wafers of sapphire\u2014a material with a hexagonal pattern of atoms which encourages 2D materials to assemble in the same, single-crystalline orientation.\"But nobody uses sapphire in the memory or logic industry,\" Kim says. \"All the infrastructure is based on silicon. For semiconductor processing, you need to use silicon wafers.\"However, wafers of silicon lack sapphire's hexagonal supporting scaffold. When researchers attempt to grow 2D materials on silicon, the result is a random patchwork of crystals that merge haphazardly, forming numerous grain boundaries that stymie conductivity.\"It's considered almost impossible to grow single-crystalline 2D materials on silicon,\" Kim says. \"Now we show you can. And our trick is to prevent the formation of grain boundaries.\"      Seed pocketsThe team's new \"nonepitaxial, single-crystalline growth\" does not require peeling and searching flakes of 2D material. Instead, the researchers use conventional vapor deposition methods to pump atoms across a silicon wafer. The atoms eventually settle on the wafer and nucleate, growing into two-dimensional crystal orientations. If left alone, each \"nucleus,\" or seed of a crystal, would grow in random orientations across the silicon wafer. But Kim and his colleagues found a way to align each growing crystal to create single-crystalline regions across the entire wafer.To do so, they first covered a silicon wafer in a \"mask\"\u2014a coating of silicon dioxide that they patterned into tiny pockets, each designed to trap a crystal seed. Across the masked wafer, they then flowed a gas of atoms that settled into each pocket to form a 2D material\u2014in this case, a TMD. The mask's pockets corralled the atoms and encouraged them to assemble on the silicon wafer in the same, single-crystalline orientation.\"That is a very shocking result,\" Kim says \"You have single-crystalline growth everywhere, even if there is no epitaxial relation between the 2D material and silicon wafer.\"With their masking method, the team fabricated a simple TMD transistor and showed that its electrical performance was just as good as a pure flake of the same material.They also applied the method to engineer a multilayered device. After covering a silicon wafer with a patterned mask, they grew one type of 2D material to fill half of each square, then grew a second type of 2D material over the first layer to fill the rest of the squares. The result was an ultrathin, single-crystalline bilayer structure within each square. Kim says that going forward, multiple 2D materials could be grown and stacked together in this way to make ultrathin, flexible, and multifunctional films.\"Until now, there has been no way of making 2D materials in single-crystalline form on silicon wafers, thus the whole community has almost given up on pursuing 2D materials for next-generation processors,\" Kim says. \"Now we have completely solved this problem, with a way to make devices smaller than a few nanometers. This will change the paradigm of Moore's Law.\" More information:Jeehwan Kim, Non-epitaxial single-crystal 2D material growth by geometrical confinement, Nature (2023).

  "text": "A team of scientists, led by researchers from the Max Born Institute in Berlin and Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin in Germany and from Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States has developed a revolutionary new method for capturing high-resolution images of fluctuations in materials at the nanoscale using powerful X-ray sources.          The technique, which they call coherent correlation imaging (CCI), allows for the creation of sharp, detailed movies without damaging the sample through excessive radiation. By using an algorithm to detect patterns in underexposed images, CCI opens paths to previously inaccessible information. The team demonstrated CCI on samples made of thin magnetic layers, and their results have been published in Nature.The microscopic realm of the world is constantly in motion and marked by unceasing alteration. Even in seemingly unchanging solid materials, these fluctuations can give rise to unusual properties; one example being the lossless transmission of electrical current in high-temperature superconductors. Fluctuations are particularly pronounced during phase transitions, where a material changes its state, such as from solid to liquid during melting.Scientists also investigate very different phase transitions, such as from non-conductive to conductive, non-magnetic to magnetic, and changes in crystal structure. Many of these processes are utilized in technology, and also play a crucial role in the functioning of living organisms.Pair correlation map of an exemplary set of 250 camera snapshots. Credit: Nature (2023). DOI: 10.1038/s41586-022-05537-9The problem: Too much illumination might damage the sampleStudying these processes in detail, however, is a difficult task, and capturing a movie of these fluctuation patterns is even more challenging. This is because the fluctuations happen quickly and take place at the nanometer scale\u2014a millionth of a millimeter. Even the most advanced high-resolution X-ray and electron microscopes are unable to capture this rapid, random motion. The problem is fundamentally rooted, as exemplified by this principle of photography: In order to capture a clear image of an object, a certain level of illumination is required. To magnify the object, that is to \"zoom in,\" more illumination is needed. Even more light is necessary when attempting to capture a fast motion with a short exposure time.Ultimately, increasing the resolution and decreasing the exposure time leads to a point where the object would be damaged or even destroyed by the illumination required. This is exactly the point science has reached in recent years: snapshots taken with free-electron lasers, the most intense X-ray sources available today, inevitably led to the destruction of the sample under study. As a result, capturing a movie of these random processes consisting of multiple images has been deemed impossible.                Map of the borders between the magnetic domains shifting back and forth in time. The whole map is only about 700 nanometers in width. Credit: Christopher Klose / MBI             New approach: Using an algorithm to detect patterns in dimly lit pictures An international team of scientists has now found a solution to this problem. The key to their solution was the realization that the fluctuation patterns in materials are often not entirely random. By focusing on a small portion of the sample, the researchers observed that certain spatial patterns repeatedly emerged, but the exact timing and frequency of these patterns were unpredictable.The scientists have developed a novel non-destructive imaging method called coherent correlation imaging (CCI). To create a movie, they take multiple snapshots of the sample in quick succession while reducing the illumination enough to keep the sample intact. However, this results in individual images where the fluctuation pattern in the sample becomes indistinct. Nevertheless, the images still contain sufficient information to separate them into groups.To accomplish this, the team first had to create a new algorithm that analyzes the correlations between the images, hence the method's name. The snapshots within each group are very similar and thus likely to originate from the same specific fluctuation pattern. It is only when all shots in a group are viewed together that a clear image of the sample emerges. The scientists are now able to rewind the film and associate each snapshot with a clear image of the sample's state at that moment in time.An example: Filming the 'dance of domains' in magnetic layersThe scientists created this new method to tackle a specific problem in the field of magnetism: microscopic patterns that occur in thin ferromagnetic layers. These layers are divided into regions known as domains, in which the magnetization points either upward or downward. Similar magnetic films are used in modern hard drives where the two different types of domains encode bits with \"0\" or \"1.\" Until now, it was believed that these patterns were extremely stable. But is this really true?To answer this question, the team investigated a sample consisting of such a magnetic layer at the National Synchrotron Light Source II on Long Island near New York City, using the newly developed CCI method. Indeed, the patterns remained unchanged at room temperature. But at a slightly elevated temperature of 37 degrees Celsius (98 degrees Fahrenheit), the domains began to move back and forth erratically, displacing each other. The scientists observed this \"dance of the domains\" for several hours. Subsequently, they created a map showing the preferred location of the boundaries between the domains. This map and the movie of the movements led to a better understanding of the magnetic interactions in the materials, promoting future applications in advanced computer architectures.New opportunities for materials research at X-ray sources The scientists' next objective is to employ the novel imaging method on free-electron lasers, such as the European XFEL in Hamburg, to gain deeper insights into even faster processes at the smallest length scales. They are confident that this method will improve our understanding of the role of fluctuations and stochastic processes in the properties of modern materials, and as a result, discover new methods of utilizing them in a more directed manner.

The results, published in the journal Chem, have relevance for the design of extended knotted and molecularly woven materials.          Knots are fundamental elements of structure and are found everywhere: either incidentally, like tangled computer cables, or for a very specific function like shoelaces or the dozens of elaborate knots used by sailors. At the scientific level, knotted structures exist in various fields as diverse as colloids (a mixture in which one or more microscopic substance is dispersed in another substance usually liquid), liquid crystals, optical beams, soap films, superfluids, and to explain the origins of the early universe. Molecular level knots also occur in DNA, RNA, proteins and polymers of sufficient length and flexibility.\"In the field of chemistry, knots remain a curiosity that few chemists have heard of, even if organic chemists are now able to synthesize different types of artificial knots in small molecules, the most famous of which are trefoils, pentafoils and figure-eight knots,\" says Anne-Sophie Duwez, professor of chemistry and head of the NANOCHEM group at ULi\u00e8ge.\"Last year, a trefoil-of-trefoils (a triskelion) containing twelve alternating crossings has been synthesized. These are extremely sophisticated templated syntheses, based on the controlled folding of portions of molecules around metal ions. These artificial knots have shown promising properties for anion (negative ion) binding, membrane transport, catalysis, materials, nanotherapeutics and the kinetic stabilization of supramolecular structures.\"While such entanglements are known to affect molecular size and shape, stability, resistance to mechanical stress and behavior under spatial confinement, much of the understanding as to how and why remains unclear. Quantifying the response of knots to external stress is central to both their usefulness and limitations.                The effects of tightening a molecular knot. Credit: Cell Press / AS Duwez             In a study published in the scientific journal Chem, the ULi\u00e8ge researchers report on the force response of synthetic small-molecule overhand (open trefoils) knots synthesized by the group of Prof. David A. Leigh (University of Manchester, U.K., and East China Normal University, in Shanghai) upon tightening.      \"We employed single-molecule force spectroscopy using an AFM-type microscope,\" explains Damien Sluysmans, lecturer and researcher in the NANOCHEM group, a state-of-the-art technique pioneered by our group for its developments on synthetic small molecules, to obtain unprecedented information on the mechanism of tightening. \"We have shown that this mechanism is associated with a high resisting force and relative rigidity compared to that for larger biological knots, and can be modulated by the chemical environment.\"With the support of quantum chemical calculations carried out by the group of Prof. Francesco Zerbetto (University of Bologna, Italy), they could demonstrate that the central metal coordination atom plays a crucial role in the tightening process, and in the reverse process that recovers the initial knotted conformation. Due to the compact structure, the complete recovery of conformation after mechanical perturbation is very fast.\"The tightening is also found to play an important role in accommodating mechanical stress. It provides a reserve of extensibility. The extra energy that the knotted strand can absorb in comparison with an unknotted strand is about 13 kcal per mole,\" continues Anne-Sophie Duwez.These results illustrate the relative stiffness of these small-molecule synthetic knots, as well as their high resistance to external mechanical loads, compared to biological knots. The higher extensibility of the knotted molecule and the extra energy that it can accommodate in response to mechanical perturbations in comparison with an unknotted one should be relevant for the design of extended knotted and woven 2D and 3D materials.

They were able to carefully grow hexagonal crystal\u2013structured nickel branches on cubic crystal\u2013structured cores to create 3D hierarchical structures with dimensions of around 10\u201320 nanometers.The resulting interconnected 3D nanostructure has a high surface area, high conductivity due to the direct connection of a metallic core and branches, and has surfaces that can be chemically modified. These properties make it an ideal electrocatalyst support\u2014a substance that helps speed up the rate of reactions\u2014in the oxygen evolution reaction, a crucial process in energy conversion. The nanostructure's properties were examined using electrochemical analysis from state-of-the-art electron microscopes provided by the Electron Microscope Unit.\"Growing the material step by step is a contrast to what we do assembling structures at the micrometer level, which is starting with bulk material and etching it down,\" says the lead author of the study Dr. Lucy Gloag, a Postdoctoral Fellow at the School of Chemistry, UNSW Science. \"This new method allows us to have excellent control over the conditions, which lets us keep all of the components ultra-small\u2014on the nanoscale\u2014where the unique catalytic properties exist.\"                Authors of the study Professor Richard Tilley and Dr Lucy Gloag. Credit: University of New South Wales             Nanocatalysts in fuel cellsIn conventional catalysts, which are often spherical, most atoms are stuck in the middle of the sphere. There are very few atoms on the surface, meaning most of the material is wasted as it can't take part in the reaction environment.These new 3D nanostructures are engineered to expose more atoms to the reaction environment, which can facilitate more efficient and effective catalysis for energy conversion, Prof. Tilley says.\"If this is used in a fuel cell or battery, having a higher surface area for the catalyst means the reaction will be more efficient when converting hydrogen into electricity,\" Prof. Tilley says.Dr. Gloag says it means that less of the material needs to be used for the reaction.\"It will eventually decrease the costs as well, making energy production more sustainable and ultimately shifting our dependence further away from fossil fuels.\"In the next research stage, the scientists will look to modify the surface of the material with platinum, which is a superior catalytic metal though more expensive. About a sixth of the cost of an electric car alone is the platinum powering the fuel cell.\"These exceptionally high surface areas would support a material like platinum to be layered on in individual atoms, so we have the absolute best use of these expensive metals in a reaction environment,\" Prof. Tilley says.

  "text": "Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a popular technique for interrogating surfaces on the micro and nano scales. The most common use for AFM is imaging; however, there are a variety of more specialized AFM techniques that can be used to determine electrical, mechanical, and chemical properties of surfaces. To adequately control the application of forces to surfaces for these techniques (especially mechanical property measurements), accurate stiffness calibrations of test cantilevers should be used.          There are a variety of test cantilever stiffness calibration techniques available, based on dimensional, static force and displacement, and dynamic vibrational methods, but in general, these have large uncertainties in the range of \u00b1 10% to \u00b1 30% and unknown accuracy. More rigorous calibrated balance techniques, with SI traceability have been pioneered, mostly by National Metrology Institutes (NMIs), but their complexity, expense, and time-consuming operation make them an out-of-reach technique for most AFM researchers. The reference cantilevers represented by NIST SRM 3461 are an accurate and precise force calibration artifact for use in the field.SRM 3461 is a silicon microfabricated device containing seven cantilevers of carrying length and stiffness is used for validating methods for determining the stiffness of atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilevers as well as directly calibrating AFM test cantilevers using the reference cantilever method.A unit of SRM 3461 consists of one silicon microfabricated device approximately 1.6 mm by 3.0 mm containing an array of seven (7) uniform, rectangular cantilevers of varying length and stiffness at the end. Each cantilever is nominally 50 \u03bcm wide and 1.45 \u03bcm thick with lengths of 300 \u03bcm to 600 \u03bcm in steps of 50 \u03bcm. The device comes adhered to a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) gel film in a protective antistatic enclosure with a removable top. It can be used as-is by temporarily removing the top or could be carefully transferred to an appropriate alternative holder. SRM 3461 was microfabricated, packaged, and calibrated in a clean room environment to minimize exposure to dust, debris, and contaminants. The packaging provided is intended to protect the device during shipping and storage in non-cleanroom laboratory environments. The device should be stored at room temperature (20 \u00b0C \u00b1 5 \u00b0C) when not in use.

  "text": "Since the success of the COVID-19 vaccine, RNA therapies have been the object of increasing interest in the biotech world. These therapies work with your body to target the genetic root of diseases and infections, a promising alternative treatment method to that of traditional pharmaceutical drugs.          Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been successfully used in drug delivery for decades. FDA-approved therapies use them as vehicles for delivering messenger RNA (mRNA), which prompts the cell to make new proteins, and small interfering RNA (siRNA), which instruct the cell to silence or inhibit the expression of certain proteins.The biggest challenge in developing a successful RNA therapy is its targeted delivery. Research is now confronting the current limitations of LNPs, which have left many diseases without an effective RNA therapy.Liver fibrosis occurs when the liver is repeatedly damaged and the healing process results in the accumulation of scar tissue, impeding healthy liver function. It is a chronic disease characterized by the buildup of excessive collagen-rich extracellular matrix (ECM). Liver fibrosis has remained challenging to treat using RNA therapies due to a lack of delivery systems for targeting activated liver-resident fibroblasts. Both the solid fibroblast structure and the lack of specificity or affinity to target these fibroblasts has impeded current LNPs from entering activated liver-resident fibroblasts, and thus they are unable to deliver RNA therapeutics.To tackle this issue and help provide a treatment for the millions of people who suffer from this chronic disease, Michael Mitchell, J. Peter and Geri Skirkanich Assistant Professor of Innovation in the Department of Bioengineering, and postdoctoral fellows Xuexiang Han and Ningqiang Gong, found a new way to synthesize ligand-tethered LNPs, increasing their selectivity and allowing them to target liver fibroblasts.Lulu Xue, Margaret Billingsley, Rakan El-Mayta, Sarah J. Shepherd, Mohamad-Gabriel Alameh and Drew Weissman, Roberts Family Professor in Vaccine Research and Director of the Penn Institute for RNA Innovation at the Perelman School of Medicine, also contributed to this work.Their study, published in Nature Communications, shows how a small-molecule ligand incorporated into the synthesis of the ionizable lipid, a key component of the LNP, creates an affinity to the notoriously hard-to-target activated fibroblasts in the liver responsible for the buildup of collagen.      The collagen buildup is accompanied by an increased expression of Heat Shock Protein 47 (HSP47), the protein that drives collagen biogenesis and secretion. Overexpression of HSP47 and increased collagen biogenesis ultimately progresses to fibrosis.Once their LNPs arrive at and enter the target cell, siRNA is released, which silences the expression of HSP47, inhibits the production of collagen and stops fibrosis in its tracks. The treatment, shown to be successful in mice, is a promising treatment for liver fibrosis in humans.This novel approach to ionizable lipid synthesis is the key to opening many more doors for RNA therapy to treat diverse diseases.\"To make LNPs selective enough to target hepatic stellate cells, those that drive fibrosis, we incorporated an anisamide ligand, a molecule which has a high affinity for the receptor on these stellate cells, into the structure of the ionizable lipid,\" says Mitchell. \"Essentially, we created a lock-and-key mechanism to target and unlock delivery to these hard-to-reach cells.\"The synthesis process was developed by Han and colleagues as a \"one-pot, two-step\" process. To create a library of ionizable lipids, the team first put an anisamide ligand (AA) precursor and different amino cores together. They then added the hydrophobic tail to create AA-tethered ionizable lipids. Anisamide was chosen as the ligand due to its neutral and stable nature as well as its affinity for the overexpressed sigma receptors on stellate cells. Once the library of AA-tethered LNPs was created, the team analyzed their abilities to target and deliver therapy to cells through a two-round selection process.\"We needed to find a specific AA-tethered LNP that was both potent and selective,\" says Han. \"The first round of the selection process was done by examining how well our LNPs could knock down green fluorescence protein (GFP) in fibroblasts to measure potency. GFP provides great visual evidence for how therapeutic RNA turns off gene expression in real time.\"\"In the second round, we tested the selective ability of the potent LNP,\" says Han. \"We did this by blocking the sigma receptor to understand how significant the specific AA ligand group was in the LNPs ability to get into target cells. Unsurprisingly, we showed that the AA group was significant; after the sigma receptor blockade, we lost the lock-and-key mechanism and the AA-tethered LNP would not enter the target cell.\"The team identified AA-T3A-C12 as both a potent and selective LNP carrying therapeutic siRNA able to achieve 65% knockdown of HSP47 expression in mice as well as enhance the recovery of damaged liver tissue. The results of the study conclude that the AA-T3A-C12 LNP outperforms the MC3 LNP, a clinically utilized non-viral vector that has been FDA-approved for use in hepatic, or liver, cell RNA therapy.This new ligand-tethered LNP provides a form of treatment for liver fibrosis and the synthesis method provides a way to tailor LNPs to other previously hard-to-target cells and tissues in the body.\"The potential of LNPs is enormous,\" says Han. \"We're making LNPs smarter and more efficient.\"\"We are excited to have produced a potential treatment that tackles the genetic root of this liver disease,\" says Mitchell. \"And, because this LNP delivery vehicle works in fibrotic cells of the liver, it may lead to developing a treatment for other types of fibrosis in the body, such as fibrosis that arises in the lung or in tumors.\"\"Beyond what we have investigated in the liver, this method of creating LNPs can be used to unlock delivery for therapies to other cell types,\" he adds. \"We could potentially target cells in the brain, lungs or heart by installing specific targeting ligands into the ionizable lipid structure. There are many avenues from here and we are excited to continue pushing this research in new directions.\" More information:Xuexiang Han et al, Ligand-tethered lipid nanoparticles for targeted RNA delivery to treat liver fibrosis, Nature Communications (2023).

  "text": "Firefighting may look vastly different in the future thanks to intelligent fire suits and masks developed by multiple research institutions in China.          Researchers published results showing breathable electrodes woven into fabric used in fire suits have proven to be stable at temperatures over 520\u00baC. At these temperatures, the fabric is found to be essentially non-combustible with high rates of thermal protection time.The study was published on January 12, 2023 in Nano Research.The results show the efficacy and practicality of Janus graphene/poly(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole)\u2014or PBO\u2014woven fabric in making firefighting \"smarter\" with the main goal being to manufacture products on an industrial scale that are flame-retardant but also intelligent enough to warn the firefighter of increased risks while traversing the flames.\"Conventional firefighting clothing and fire masks can ensure firemen's safety to a certain extent,\" said Wei Fan, professor and researcher at the School of Textile Science and Engineering at Xi'an Polytechnic University. \"However, the fire scene often changes quickly, sometimes leaving firefighters trapped in the fire for failing to judge the risks in time. In these situations, firefighters also need to be rescued.\"The key here is the use of Janus graphene/PBO, woven fabrics. PBO fibers offer better strength and fire protection than other similar fibers, such as Kevlar. The PBO fibers are first woven into a fabric that is then irradiated using a CO2 infrared laser. From here, the fabric becomes the Janus graphene/PBO hybrid that is the focus of the study.The mask also utilizes a top and bottom layer of Janus graphene/PBO with a piezoelectric layer in between that acts as a way to convert mechanical pressures to electricity, and vice versa.\"The mask has a good smoke particle filtration effect, and the filtration efficiency of PM2.5 and PM3.0 reaches 95% and 100%, respectively. Meanwhile, the mask has good wearing comfort as its respiratory resistance (46.8 Pa) is lower than 49 Pa of commercial masks. Besides, the mask is sensitive to the speed and intensity of human breathing, which can dynamically monitor the health of the firemen,\" said Fan.Flame-retardant electronics featured in these fire suits are flexible, heat resistant, and quick to make and low-cost, which makes scaling for industrial production a tangible achievement. This makes it more likely that future firefighting suits and masks will be able to effectively use this technology. Quick, effective responses can also reduce economic losses attributed to fires.\"The graphene/PBO woven fabrics-based sensors exhibit good repeatability and stability in human motion monitoring and NO2 gas detection, the main toxic gas in fires, which can be applied to firefighting suits to help firefighters effectively avoiding danger,\" Fan said. Being able to detect sharp increases in NO2 gas can help firefighters change course in an instant if needed and could be a lifesaving addition to firefighter gear.Major improvements can be made in the firefighting field to better protect the firefighters by taking advantage of graphene/PBO woven and nonwoven fabrics. Widescale use of this technology can help the researchers reach their ultimate goal of reducing mortality and injury to those who risk their lives fighting fires.

  "text": "There are many ways to initiate chemical reactions in liquids, but placing free electrons directly into water, ammonia and other liquid solutions is especially attractive for green chemistry because solvated electrons are inherently clean, leaving behind no side products after they react.          In theory, solvated electrons could be used to safely and sustainably break down carbon dioxide or chemical pollutants in contaminated water, but it has been impractical to find out because they've been difficult and expensive to make in pure form.That could change thanks to new research from chemists at Rice University, Stanford University and the University of Texas at Austin. In a published study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers from the Center for Adapting Flaws into Features (CAFF) uncovered the long-sought mechanism of a well-known but poorly understood process that produces solvated electrons via interactions between light and metal.When light strikes a metal nanoparticle\u2014or nanoscale imperfections on a larger metal surface\u2014it can excite waves of electrons called plasmons. If the frequency of neighboring plasmons match, they can also resonate and reinforce one another. While prior research had suggested plasmonic resonance could produce solvated electrons, the researchers from CAFF are the first to explicitly and quantitatively demonstrate the process.                An electrode coated with 95-nanometer silver nanoparticles. Credit: Rice University             \"Given the long history of the field, the challenge was both proving the existence of solvated electrons and then also linking their generation to the plasmon resonance,\" said Rice's Stephan Link, a co-corresponding author of the paper. \"It really required teamwork and expertise from several research groups.\"Study first author Alexander Al-Zubeidi, a graduate student at Rice, and colleagues showed they could make solvated electrons by shining light on silver electrodes suspended in water. They then showed they could boost the yield of solvated electrons tenfold by first coating the electrodes with silver nanoparticles.\"Making solvated electrons in high quantities is very challenging,\" said co-corresponding author Sean Roberts of UT Austin. \"Our results show quantitatively how nanostructuring of electrode surfaces can really boost the rate with which they generate solvated electrons. That could potentially open up new ways of driving chemical reactions.\"      Solvated electrons\u2014essentially freely floating electrons in a solution like water\u2014could potentially react with carbon dioxide, turning it into other useful molecules, including fuels, in a net-carbon-neutral way. These electrons could also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing the fossil-fuel-heavy industrial process for making ammonia-based fertilizers with a greener alternative. For the treatment of contaminated water, they could be used to break down chemical pollutants such as nitrates, organic chlorides, dyes and aromatic molecules.\"A key challenge remains,\" said CAFF director and study co-author Christy Landes of Rice. \"The silver nanoparticles in our experiments were arranged at random, mimicking the tiny imperfections one might find on the surface of a flawed material. The next step is optimization. We hope to enhance solvated electron generation by several orders of magnitude by translating our findings to materials with ordered arrays of coupled plasmons with specific resonance energies.\" More information:Alexander Al-Zubeidi et al, Mechanism for plasmon-generated solvated electrons, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2023).

  "text": "Chemists from St Petersburg University have developed a method for purifying water from organic compounds using tin oxide nanoparticle based photocatalysts. The findings of the research are published in the Journal of Alloys and Compounds .          Water pollution is an acute environmental issue. Due to the high rate of industrial development and increasing volumes of wastewater, the ecology of water bodies is deteriorating. Scientists are therefore working hard to develop new ways of treating industrial discharges that would quickly and without unnecessary waste purify water from complex pollutants such as organic dyes.One of the most promising approaches in wastewater treatment technology to purify water is to use photocatalysis. It is a process in which light energy is used to trigger chemical reactions to break down organic compounds into carbon dioxide and water through the presence of a catalyst\u2014a special material in the form of nanoparticles. Until now, there has been no understanding of what exactly determines the efficiency and speed of such purification: the size of the particles, the features of their structure or their composition. The researchers from St Petersburg University have found the answer to this question.The chemists from St Petersburg University proposed a systematic approach to matching a particular pollutant with nanoparticles for use in photocatalytic water purification units. The materials developed exhibit photocatalytic activity when exposed to visible light from ordinary diode lamps, which in all respects are cheaper and easier to operate than the ultraviolet ones used previously.\"We offer a fundamentally new approach, which can be compared to a road navigation system. For example, you can use an ordinary paper map when choosing a route to your destination, plotting your route yourself in real time, guided by road signs and the situation.\"We propose an algorithm similar to modern navigation systems which, for any desired destination, process several route options, analyze the current traffic situation and select the shortest route. Whereas previously the materials for photocatalysts were chosen almost at random, today this process is becoming thoughtful and well-founded,\" said Anastasiia Podurets, principal investigator of the project and an early career researcher in the Department of General and Inorganic Chemistry at St Petersburg University.Nanoparticles based on tin dioxide containing three elements (cobalt, nickel, copper) were used. The research team of synthesis and research of nanoparticles and nanostructured materials carried out a large-scale study of nanoparticles formation processes and products of photocatalytic decomposition of pollutants under different conditions.The scientists have found out that in order to create an effective catalyst, it is necessary to organize its synthesis in such a way that a solid body with the maximum number of oxygen vacancies\u2014lattice defects when there are no individual atoms in it\u2014is formed. It is the vacancies that allow the emerging electron-hole pairs to be transferred to the surface of nanoparticles, where they play a major role in the destruction of pollutant molecules. It is important not to have too many other defects, otherwise the result will be the opposite. The approach developed has been proven with the widely used organic dye methylene blue and the antibiotic oxytetracycline.Studies on water remediation methods using nanoparticles have also been published in the journals Materials Chemistry and Physics and Journal of Hazardous Materials.In addition to photocatalysis, the scientists demonstrated the antibacterial activity of the synthesized nanoparticles using E. coli bacteria. As the mechanisms of destruction of organic molecules are similar to those used for neutralizing bacteria, effective photocatalysts are also capable of destroying the corresponding bacteria.The researchers say that this method is also applicable to other pollutants: Special calculations are needed to understand how to change the parameters of nanoparticles against different pollutants.

  "text": "National University of Singapore scientists have fabricated nano-sized vesicles from cells via a cell shearing approach that can be used for various biomedical applications.          Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are naturally occurring cell-secreted lipid-bound membrane vesicles found in all biological fluids. They have gained much attention for their potential role in several biomedical applications including diagnostic purposes (biomarkers), as therapeutic agents and as drug delivery systems. The use of EVs as therapeutic agents, particularly those obtained from stem cells, has shown regenerative and/or tissue reparative effects.More importantly, EVs represent cell-free approaches as they are non-viable and work mainly via paracrine signaling, thus mitigating the challenges associated with cell-based therapy. However, several limitations need to be addressed before EVs can be extensively used as therapeutics, and these include long and tedious isolation processes, and low production yields.In a recent paper published in Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B, Associate Professor Giorgia Pastorin and her research team from the Department of Pharmacy, National University of Singapore, in collaboration with Assistant Professor Bertrand Czarny from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and researchers from the Singapore Eye Research Institute (SERI), prepared nano-sized vesicles from cells via a cell shearing approach for use in wound healing and tissue regenerative applications. They found that these nano-sized vesicles called Cell-Derived Nanovesicles (CDNs) mimic the EVs not only in terms of their physical characteristics but also in their biological cargos (proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids) and can be produced at much higher yields.Prof. Pastorin said, \"This research study shows that cell-derived nanovesicles hold promise for various biomedical applications. Our team has derived the nanovesicles from various cell types such as immune cells and stem cells for inflammation reduction and tissue regeneration, respectively.\"In this study, Prof. Pastorin, and her doctoral student Dr. Yub Raj Neupane in collaboration with Dr. Harish K Handral from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, and Prof Czarny investigated the role that CDNs obtained from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-CDNs) played in accelerating wound healing. As part of this investigation, high-throughput proteomics and gene ontology analysis were performed to identify the highly enriched proteins and their localization in these vesicles.The researchers found that these MSC-CDNs activated a signaling pathway in human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cells. This increased the proliferation and migration of HDF cells towards the wound bed, along with an enhanced release of cell-proliferation related markers, growth factors and other cellular regeneration components to aid in the healing process.This study also demonstrated that these MSC-CDNs enhanced the formation of new blood vessels in cell cultures. In murine models, they were found to promote healing at a similar extent when compared to MSC-EVs but with a healing rate that was almost twice as fast.In future work, the team will continue exploring the use of these vesicles as therapeutic agents for cardiovascular diseases and for drug delivery purposes.

  "text": "Researchers in Drexel University's College of Engineering have developed a thin film device, fabricated by spray coating, that can block electromagnetic radiation with the flip of a switch. The breakthrough, enabled by versatile two-dimensional materials called MXenes, could adjust the performance of electronic devices, strengthen wireless connections and secure mobile communications against intrusion.          The team, led by Yury Gogotsi, Ph.D., Distinguished University and Bach professor in Drexel's College of Engineering, previously demonstrated that the two-dimensional layered MXene materials, discovered just over a decade ago, when combined with an electrolyte solution, can be turned into a potent active shield against electromagnetic waves.This latest MXene discovery, reported in Nature Nanotechnology, shows how this shielding can be tuned when a small voltage\u2014less than that produced by an alkaline battery\u2014is applied.\"Dynamic control of electromagnetic wave jamming has been a significant technological challenge for protecting electronic devices working at gigahertz frequencies and a variety of other communications technologies,\" Gogotsi said.\"As the number of wireless devices being used in industrial and private sectors has increased by orders of magnitude over the past decade, the urgency of this challenge has grown accordingly. This is why our discovery\u2014which would dynamically mitigate the effect of electromagnetic interference on these devices\u2014could have a broad impact.\"Active EMI shielding change of the V2CTx film. Credit: Nature Nanotechnology (2023). DOI: 10.1038/s41565-022-01308-9MXene is a unique material in that it is highly conductive\u2014making it perfectly suited for reflecting microwave radiation that could cause static, feedback or diminish the performance of communications devices\u2014but its internal chemical structure can also be temporarily altered to allow these electromagnetic waves to pass through.This means that a thin coating on a device or electrical components prevents them from both emitting electromagnetic waves, as well as being penetrated by those emitted by other electronics. Eliminating the possibility of interference from both internal and external sources can ensure the performance of the device, but some waves must be allowed to exit and enter when it is being used for communication.      \"Without being able to control the ebb and flow of electromagnetic waves within and around a device, it's a bit like a leaky faucet\u2014you're not really turning off the water and that constant dripping is no good,\" Gogotsi said. \"Our shielding ensures the plumbing is tight\u2014so-to-speak\u2014no electromagnetic radiation is leaking out or getting in until we want to use the device.\"The key to eliciting bidirectional tunability of MXene's shielding property is using the flow and expulsion of ions to alternately expand and compress the space between material's layers, like an accordion, as well as to change the surface chemistry of MXenes.With a small voltage applied to the film, ions enter\u2014or intercalate\u2014between the MXene layers altering the charge of their surface and inducing electrostatic attraction, which serves to change the layer spacing, the conductivity and shielding efficiency of the material. When the ions are deintercalated, as the current is switched off, the MXene layers return to their original state.The team tested 10 different MXene-electrolyte combinations, applying each via paint sprayer in a layer about 30 to 100 times thinner than a human hair. The materials consistently demonstrated the dynamic tunability of shielding efficiency in blocking microwave radiation, which is impossible for traditional metals like copper and steel. And the device sustained the performance through more than 500 charge-discharge cycles.\"These results indicate that the MXene films can convert from electromagnetic interference shielding to quasi-electromagnetic wave transmission by electrochemical oxidation of MXenes,\" Gogotsi and his co-authors wrote. \"The MXene film can potentially serve as a dynamic EMI shielding switch.\"For security applications, Gogotsi suggests that the MXene shielding could hide devices from detection by radar or other tracing systems. The team also tested the potential of a one-way shielding switch. This would allow a device to remain undetectable and protected from unauthorized access until it is deployed for use.\"A one-way switch could open the protection and allow a signal to be sent or communication to be opened in an emergency or at the required moment,\" Gogotsi said. \"This means it could protect communications equipment from being influenced or tampered with until it is in use. For example, it could encase the device during transportation or storage and then activate only when it is ready to be used.\"The next step for Gogotsi's team is to explore additional MXene-electrolyte combinations and mechanisms to fine-tune the shielding to achieve a stronger modulation of electromagnetic wave transmission and dynamic adjustment to block radiation at a variety of bandwidths.

  "text": "Cambridge researchers have developed a new test that \"fishes\" for multiple respiratory viruses at once using single strands of DNA as bait and gives highly accurate results in under an hour.          The test uses DNA \"nanobait\" to detect the most common respiratory viruses\u2014including influenza, rhinovirus, RSV and COVID-19\u2014at the same time. In comparison, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests, while highly specific and highly accurate, can only test for a single virus at a time and take several hours to return a result.While many common respiratory viruses have similar symptoms, they require different treatments. By testing for multiple viruses at once, the researchers say their test will ensure patients get the right treatment quickly and could also reduce the unwarranted use of antibiotics.In addition, the tests can be used in any setting, and can be easily modified to detect different bacteria and viruses, including potential new variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19. The results are reported in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.The winter cold, flu and RSV season has arrived in the northern hemisphere, and health care workers must make quick decisions about treatment when patients show up in their hospital or clinic.\"Many respiratory viruses have similar symptoms but require different treatments: we wanted to see if we could search for multiple viruses in parallel,\" said Filip Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 from Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory, the paper's first author. \"According to the World Health Organization, respiratory viruses are the cause of death for 20% of children who die under the age of five. If you could come up with a test that could detect multiple viruses quickly and accurately, it could make a huge difference.\"For Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, the research is also personal: as a young child, he was in hospital for almost a month with a high fever. Doctors could not figure out the cause of his illness until a PCR machine became available.\"Good diagnostics are the key to good treatments,\" said Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, who is a Ph.D. student at St John's College, Cambridge. \"People show up at hospital in need of treatment and they might be carrying multiple different viruses, but unless you can discriminate between different viruses, there is a risk patients could receive incorrect treatment.\"      PCR tests are powerful, sensitive and accurate, but they require a piece of genome to be copied millions of times, which takes several hours.The Cambridge researchers wanted to develop a test that uses RNA to detect viruses directly, without the need to copy the genome, but with high enough sensitivity to be useful in a health care setting.\"For patients, we know that rapid diagnosis improves their outcome, so being able to detect the infectious agent quickly could save their life,\" said co-author Professor Stephen Baker, from the Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease. \"For health care workers, such a test could be used anywhere, in the UK or in any low- or middle-income setting, which helps ensure patients get the correct treatment quickly and reduce the use of unwarranted antibiotics.\"The researchers based their test on structures built from double strands of DNA with overhanging single strands. These single strands are the \"bait\": they are programmed to \"fish\" for specific regions in the RNA of target viruses. The nanobaits are then passed through very tiny holes called nanopores. Nanopore sensing is like a ticker tape reader that transforms molecular structures into digital information in milliseconds. The structure of each nanobait reveals the target virus or its variant.The researchers showed that the test can easily be reprogrammed to discriminate between viral variants, including variants of the virus that causes COVID-19. The approach enables near 100% specificity due to the precision of the programmable nanobait structures.\"This work elegantly uses new technology to solve multiple current limitations in one go,\" said Baker. \"One of the things we struggle with most is the rapid and accurate identification of the organisms causing the infection. This technology is a potential game changer; a rapid, low-cost diagnostic platform that is simple and can be used anywhere on any sample.\"A patent on the technology has been filed by Cambridge Enterprise, the University's commercialization arm, and co-author Professor Ulrich Keyser has co-founded a company, Cambridge Nucleomics, focused on RNA detection with single-molecule precision.\"Nanobait is based on DNA nanotechnology and will allow for many more exciting applications in the future,\" said Keyser, who is based at the Cavendish Laboratory. \"For commercial applications and roll-out to the public we will have to convert our nanopore platform into a hand-held device.\"\"Bringing together researchers from medicine, physics, engineering and chemistry helped us come up with a truly meaningful solution to a difficult problem,\" said Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, who received a 2022 Ph.D. award from Cambridge Society for Applied Research for this work.
